    "* **train.csv:** a labeled dataset of transponder codes and whether each plane is a surveillance plane or not\n",
    "    - The `label` column was originally `class`, but I renamed it because pandas freaks out a bit with a column named `class`\n",
    "    - This was created by Buzzfeed `feds.csv`\n",

    "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security operate many planes that are not directly labeled as belonging to the government. If we can uncover these planes, we have a better idea of the surveillance activities they are undertaking."
