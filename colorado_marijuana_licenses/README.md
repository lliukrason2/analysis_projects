This project came out of a desire to learn more about Colorado's retail marijuana ecosystem. Driving questions going into this project were: Who controls marijuana in Colorado? Where are licenses being issued? 

This project includes:
-a scraper of Colorado's retail marijuana license database
-script that cleans resulting dataframe and merges with Colorado income data
-HTML map displaying number of licenses and relative income quartile of county

Future work with this project could include:
-aggregating names of license holders
-looking at revoked licenses
