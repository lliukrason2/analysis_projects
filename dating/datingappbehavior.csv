the person im currently dating i met through a mutual friend, and i met that friend completely randomly, though i dated HER friend once upon a time-- again, met through completely random happenstance. one does not go bars to meet people. one meets people through social gatherings or through this web of online dating.

why do people online date? why do they swipe and swipe and swipe if they never want to really reach out to a human? women get approached by loads of creepy men on tinder i know (""Hey, ur cute! would love to buy u a drink some time"" and it's like ""fuck off brah i know i'm cute, tell me why you're worth it""), but i think there is a general exhaustion that comes from this obsession with the scarcity versus pretend-not-actual-scarcity thing. real and meaningful relationships are so fleeting and elusive in the oversaturated media barrage of tinder and OKC. it would be interesting to explore that in some depth as a comparison to meeting people in real life."

So, for me, dating apps are remarkably validating. Perhaps 75 percent of the time or more that I swipe right, I get swiped right on in return, and it makes me feel attractive and optimistic. For many of my male friends, they are swiped right on in return perhaps 25 percent of the time, and it makes them feel lonely or unattractive. Because of that, when I treat dating apps as a tool for validation, it upsets many male friends, and it seems like that is because they do not feel the same validating effect of the dating apps. I just find it interesting that for me the apps have always been sort of cathartic but for large swaths of my friends they’ve been the exact opposite. "
