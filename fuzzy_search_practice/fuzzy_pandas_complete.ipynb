    "## Fuzzy Matching and Fuzzy Pandas\n",
    "      \n",
    "[Max Harlow](https://twitter.com/maxharlow), a journalist at the Financial Times, wrote this library `csvmatch`, and he's been adding new algorithms to facilitate fuzzy matching across datasets. He's used it for a bunch of stories, including:\n",
    "- https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/09/offshore-tax-dealings-celebrities-sportsmen-leaked-jersey-files\n",
    "- https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/08/offshore-secrets-wealthy-political-donors\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar techniques have also been used in other stories like:\n",
    "- https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/myanmarjade\n",
    "- https://www.irinnews.org/investigation/2016/09/02/exclusive-un-paying-blacklisted-diamond-company-central-african-republic\n",
    "\n",
    "But, wait, first: \n",

    "### What is Fuzzy Matching? \n",
    "\n",
    "Automating the look-up for names in documents is [inherently imprecise](https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-fuzzy-search). The computer can't _know_ that different representations of the same _thing_ refer to the same _thing_. For example: \n",
    "- _Apple Inc._; _Apple Computer Company_; _Apple Computer, Inc._; and _Apple_ all refer to the fruit company. \n",
    "- _Samuel Langhorne Clemens_, _Samuel L. Clemens_, _Samuel Clemens_ and Mark Twain all refer to the same person. \n",
    "- _Robert Ford_, _Rob Ford_, and _Robert Frod_ refer to the same person **probably**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working with unstructured data, you can't take anything for granted. Least of all, you can't assume that:\n",
    "- documents will have correct spellings\n",
    "- first, last, and middle names will exist in all documents\n",
    "- the abbreviated/shortened names of people won't make an appearance (e.g. Jon instead of Jonathan, Tom instead of Thomas, Phil instead of Philip, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you're living in an uncertain world, you try to make things slightly more _certain_ with **Fuzzy Matching**. You might not hit 100 percent, but at least you'll hit more than what you would without fuzzy matching. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple algorithms that try to minimise the uncertainty/enable fuzzy matching. The library we are going to be look at today incorporates a bunch of these, instead of just doing one thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's predominantly based on an [awesome NICAR2019 presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1djKgqFbkYDM8fdczFhnEJLwapzmt4RLuEjXkJZpKves/) where Max Harlow (the aforementioned news app developer at the Financial Times) demonstrated [csvmatch](https://github.com/maxharlow/csvmatch). And, then, Soma basically created a library to make it with Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Worth remembering that there are no shortcuts in life, and few panaceas. Depending on the project you're working on, you might be more inclined to use one algorithm or the other. Or, you know, try a few of them and see what happens. And, also, remember: all computational tools you use need to hand-in-hand with traditional reporting. People share names, there's more than one John Smith, etc. \n"
