# Project Summary
This project came out of a desire to learn more about the political fundraising campaigns on GoFundMe's platform.


Driving questions going into this project were: 
* Are the fundraisers on GoFundMe more right-leaning or left-leaning and what does their financial performance look like?
* Given that GoFundMe has no official "Political" category, what types of political or politically inspired fundraisers are there? 


# Project Contents
This project includes:
* scrapers of GoFundMe search results for the terms "democrat" and "republican"
* scripts cleaning resulting datasets
* scripts merging datasets
* script trying to determine feature importance of words in campaign summary to predict "democrat" or "republican"
* scripts generating visualizations of campaigns and campaign summaries

# Future Work
Future work with this project could include:
* tagging all project individually as left-leaning or right-leaning to better utilize feature importance script
