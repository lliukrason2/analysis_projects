Due to an extremely high demand to see Louder with Crowder live at SMU, we are renting the largest venue on SMU's campus. Unfortunately, the need to use McFarlin has significantly increased our expected cost of the event. Our organization needs help paying for the venue, security, and necessary equipment for the show in order to keep it at McFarlin and ensure we have the maximum possible attendance. Within four days of the Eventbrite being posted, the venue is already set to be at least half full. We are expecting to have at least 1200 attendees at the event. It would be extremely disappointing for them if we have to switch to a smaller venue, so we want to do everything we can to keep Louder With Crowder in the largest venue on campus. We are striving to provide the best experience for SMU students and the DFW community to have an entertaining, educational night by hearing Steven's conservative message. Any help we receive will be extremely appreciated by everyone planning to attend, as well as our organization. We hope that whether you donate or not, you come to the event and have a great time!</td>\n",

We stopped accepting donations then because our aim is to fund re-opening the bombed-out office, and we decided that we had gathered a reasonable amount for that purpose. There are many worth causes, partisan and non-partisan. For example, might we suggest contributing to a North Carolina classroom through DonorsChoose ? Here's the original campaign description,DESCRIPTIONOn October 16, a North Carolina headquarters of the Republican Party was firebombed , and an abhorrent threat was painted on its outside wallAs Democrats, we are starting this campaign to enable the Orange County, North Carolina Republican office to re-open as soon as possible. Until an investigation is undertaken, we cannot know who did this or why. No matter the result, this is not how Americans resolve their differences. We talk, we argue, sometimes we march, and most of all we vote. We do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs.So, let's all pitch in , no matter what your party affiliation, in and get that office open again quickly.More InfoHere's some additional information that GoFundMe likes to see expressed:My name is David Weinberger.  (There's more about me here and here.) My name is on this campaign, but it's actually the work of several people:Dan GillmorJeff JarvisClay ShirkyJoe TrippiZeynep TufekciAll of us are long-time Internet students and do-ers.  We're also all either Democrats, or independents who are leaning that way in this cycle.We put this campaign together quickly after talking about an idea that Zeynep tweeted .  The idea evolved to the point where a GFM campaign made sense. I initiated it. Our aim is, as stated, to help fund the re-opening of the bombed-out office. We do not want any of the funds gathered to be used for other political activities. We are currently talking with officials of Orange County and hope soon to be talking with the local GOP leaders to figure out how to provide this funding in a way that meets the election laws (which are complex) and that accomplishes the campaign's stated goal of re-opening the office. If there's no legal, practical way to put all of the money to that use, we will find a strictly non-partisan way of using it, and will let the donors know  so that they can participate in the decision.Thanks for your support in standing up for democracy, even when we disagree (sometimes quite fundamenally) with the policies of some of the participants.</td>\n",

       "0  SMU College Republicans is bringing comedian Steven Crowder to SMU on Thursday, March 22 at 7pm in McFarlin Auditorium. Due to an extremely high demand to see Louder with Crowder live at SMU, we are renting the largest venue on SMU's campus. Unfortunately, the need to use McFarlin has significantly increased our expected cost of the event. Our organization needs help paying for the venue, security, and necessary equipment for the show in order to keep it at McFarlin and ensure we have the maximum possible attendance. Within four days of the Eventbrite being posted, the venue is already set to be at least half full. We are expecting to have at least 1200 attendees at the event. It would be extremely disappointing for them if we have to switch to a smaller venue, so we want to do everything we can to keep Louder With Crowder in the largest venue on campus. We are striving to provide the best experience for SMU students and the DFW community to have an entertaining, educational night by hearing Steven's conservative message. Any help we receive will be extremely appreciated by everyone planning to attend, as well as our organization. We hope that whether you donate or not, you come to the event and have a great time!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1  NOTE: We reached our goal and then some in less than 40 minutes after we went public with this campaign. We stopped accepting donations then because our aim is to fund re-opening the bombed-out office, and we decided that we had gathered a reasonable amount for that purpose. There are many worth causes, partisan and non-partisan. For example, might we suggest contributing to a North Carolina classroom through DonorsChoose ? Here's the original campaign description,DESCRIPTIONOn October 16, a North Carolina headquarters of the Republican Party was firebombed , and an abhorrent threat was painted on its outside wallAs Democrats, we are starting this campaign to enable the Orange County, North Carolina Republican office to re-open as soon as possible. Until an investigation is undertaken, we cannot know who did this or why. No matter the result, this is not how Americans resolve their differences. We talk, we argue, sometimes we march, and most of all we vote. We do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs.So, let's all pitch in , no matter what your party affiliation, in and get that office open again quickly.More InfoHere's some additional information that GoFundMe likes to see expressed:My name is David Weinberger.  (There's more about me here and here.) My name is on this campaign, but it's actually the work of several people:Dan GillmorJeff JarvisClay ShirkyJoe TrippiZeynep TufekciAll of us are long-time Internet students and do-ers.  We're also all either Democrats, or independents who are leaning that way in this cycle.We put this campaign together quickly after talking about an idea that Zeynep tweeted .  The idea evolved to the point where a GFM campaign made sense. I initiated it. Our aim is, as stated, to help fund the re-opening of the bombed-out office. We do not want any of the funds gathered to be used for other political activities. We are currently talking with officials of Orange County and hope soon to be talking with the local GOP leaders to figure out how to provide this funding in a way that meets the election laws (which are complex) and that accomplishes the campaign's stated goal of re-opening the office. If there's no legal, practical way to put all of the money to that use, we will find a strictly non-partisan way of using it, and will let the donors know  so that they can participate in the decision.Thanks for your support in standing up for democracy, even when we disagree (sometimes quite fundamenally) with the policies of some of the participants.   \n",

He is currently in stable but critical condition following surgery, and him and his family need all the support they can get to help them during this difficult time. Please help by donating & continue to pray for him and his family. ALL money will be given to Mr. Sanchez and his family (minus GoFund Me fees).

       "      <td>SMU College Republicans is bringing comedian Steven Crowder to SMU on Thursday, March 22 at 7pm in McFarlin Auditorium. Due to an extremely high demand to see Louder with Crowder live at SMU, we are renting the largest venue on SMU's campus. Unfortunately, the need to use McFarlin has significantly increased our expected cost of the event. Our organization needs help paying for the venue, security, and necessary equipment for the show in order to keep it at McFarlin and ensure we have the maximum possible attendance. Within four days of the Eventbrite being posted, the venue is already set to be at least half full. We are expecting to have at least 1200 attendees at the event. It would be extremely disappointing for them if we have to switch to a smaller venue, so we want to do everything we can to keep Louder With Crowder in the largest venue on campus. We are striving to provide the best experience for SMU students and the DFW community to have an entertaining, educational night by hearing Steven's conservative message. Any help we receive will be extremely appreciated by everyone planning to attend, as well as our organization. We hope that whether you donate or not, you come to the event and have a great time!</td>\n",

       "      <td>SMU College Republicans is bringing comedian Steven Crowder to SMU on Thursday, March 22 at 7pm in McFarlin Auditorium. Due to an extremely high demand to see Louder with Crowder live at SMU, we are renting the largest venue on SMU's campus. Unfortunately, the need to use McFarlin has significantly increased our expected cost of the event. Our organization needs help paying for the venue, security, and necessary equipment for the show in order to keep it at McFarlin and ensure we have the maximum possible attendance. Within four days of the Eventbrite being posted, the venue is already set to be at least half full. We are expecting to have at least 1200 attendees at the event. It would be extremely disappointing for them if we have to switch to a smaller venue, so we want to do everything we can to keep Louder With Crowder in the largest venue on campus. We are striving to provide the best experience for SMU students and the DFW community to have an entertaining, educational night by hearing Steven's conservative message. Any help we receive will be extremely appreciated by everyone planning to attend, as well as our organization. We hope that whether you donate or not, you come to the event and have a great time!</td>\n",

       "      <td>NOTE: We reached our goal and then some in less than 40 minutes after we went public with this campaign. We stopped accepting donations then because our aim is to fund re-opening the bombed-out office, and we decided that we had gathered a reasonable amount for that purpose. There are many worth causes, partisan and non-partisan. For example, might we suggest contributing to a North Carolina classroom through DonorsChoose ? Here's the original campaign description,DESCRIPTIONOn October 16, a North Carolina headquarters of the Republican Party was firebombed , and an abhorrent threat was painted on its outside wallAs Democrats, we are starting this campaign to enable the Orange County, North Carolina Republican office to re-open as soon as possible. Until an investigation is undertaken, we cannot know who did this or why. No matter the result, this is not how Americans resolve their differences. We talk, we argue, sometimes we march, and most of all we vote. We do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs.So, let's all pitch in , no matter what your party affiliation, in and get that office open again quickly.More InfoHere's some additional information that GoFundMe likes to see expressed:My name is David Weinberger.  (There's more about me here and here.) My name is on this campaign, but it's actually the work of several people:Dan GillmorJeff JarvisClay ShirkyJoe TrippiZeynep TufekciAll of us are long-time Internet students and do-ers.  We're also all either Democrats, or independents who are leaning that way in this cycle.We put this campaign together quickly after talking about an idea that Zeynep tweeted .  The idea evolved to the point where a GFM campaign made sense. I initiated it. Our aim is, as stated, to help fund the re-opening of the bombed-out office. We do not want any of the funds gathered to be used for other political activities. We are currently talking with officials of Orange County and hope soon to be talking with the local GOP leaders to figure out how to provide this funding in a way that meets the election laws (which are complex) and that accomplishes the campaign's stated goal of re-opening the office. If there's no legal, practical way to put all of the money to that use, we will find a strictly non-partisan way of using it, and will let the donors know  so that they can participate in the decision.Thanks for your support in standing up for democracy, even when we disagree (sometimes quite fundamenally) with the policies of some of the participants.</td>\n",

       "0  SMU College Republicans is bringing comedian Steven Crowder to SMU on Thursday, March 22 at 7pm in McFarlin Auditorium. Due to an extremely high demand to see Louder with Crowder live at SMU, we are renting the largest venue on SMU's campus. Unfortunately, the need to use McFarlin has significantly increased our expected cost of the event. Our organization needs help paying for the venue, security, and necessary equipment for the show in order to keep it at McFarlin and ensure we have the maximum possible attendance. Within four days of the Eventbrite being posted, the venue is already set to be at least half full. We are expecting to have at least 1200 attendees at the event. It would be extremely disappointing for them if we have to switch to a smaller venue, so we want to do everything we can to keep Louder With Crowder in the largest venue on campus. We are striving to provide the best experience for SMU students and the DFW community to have an entertaining, educational night by hearing Steven's conservative message. Any help we receive will be extremely appreciated by everyone planning to attend, as well as our organization. We hope that whether you donate or not, you come to the event and have a great time!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1  NOTE: We reached our goal and then some in less than 40 minutes after we went public with this campaign. We stopped accepting donations then because our aim is to fund re-opening the bombed-out office, and we decided that we had gathered a reasonable amount for that purpose. There are many worth causes, partisan and non-partisan. For example, might we suggest contributing to a North Carolina classroom through DonorsChoose ? Here's the original campaign description,DESCRIPTIONOn October 16, a North Carolina headquarters of the Republican Party was firebombed , and an abhorrent threat was painted on its outside wallAs Democrats, we are starting this campaign to enable the Orange County, North Carolina Republican office to re-open as soon as possible. Until an investigation is undertaken, we cannot know who did this or why. No matter the result, this is not how Americans resolve their differences. We talk, we argue, sometimes we march, and most of all we vote. We do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs.So, let's all pitch in , no matter what your party affiliation, in and get that office open again quickly.More InfoHere's some additional information that GoFundMe likes to see expressed:My name is David Weinberger.  (There's more about me here and here.) My name is on this campaign, but it's actually the work of several people:Dan GillmorJeff JarvisClay ShirkyJoe TrippiZeynep TufekciAll of us are long-time Internet students and do-ers.  We're also all either Democrats, or independents who are leaning that way in this cycle.We put this campaign together quickly after talking about an idea that Zeynep tweeted .  The idea evolved to the point where a GFM campaign made sense. I initiated it. Our aim is, as stated, to help fund the re-opening of the bombed-out office. We do not want any of the funds gathered to be used for other political activities. We are currently talking with officials of Orange County and hope soon to be talking with the local GOP leaders to figure out how to provide this funding in a way that meets the election laws (which are complex) and that accomplishes the campaign's stated goal of re-opening the office. If there's no legal, practical way to put all of the money to that use, we will find a strictly non-partisan way of using it, and will let the donors know  so that they can participate in the decision.Thanks for your support in standing up for democracy, even when we disagree (sometimes quite fundamenally) with the policies of some of the participants.   \n",

He is currently in stable but critical condition following surgery, and him and his family need all the support they can get to help them during this difficult time. Please help by donating & continue to pray for him and his family. ALL money will be given to Mr. Sanchez and his family (minus GoFund Me fees). We have also received permission from his family to start this donation page. If you have any questions, email: hidalgocountytars@gmail.com page managed by Hidalgo County Teenage Republicans; funds will be withdrawn to Trooper Sanchez’s wife, Yvonee Sanchez.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
