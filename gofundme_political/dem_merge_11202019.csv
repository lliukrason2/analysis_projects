Reduced stress on the voting system on Election Day resulting in less voter frustration.2. Shorter lines on Election Day. “Early voters are happy voters, and Election Day votersare grumpy voters.”3. Improved poll worker performance (extended voting period allows poll workers to gain experience thereby reducing errors).4. Early identification and correction of registration errors and voting system glitches; and5. Greater access to voting and increased voter satisfaction (convenience and flexibility).We have the volunteers on the ground. We need money to print 2 volunteer guides, Voter Tracker sheets, Bank the Blue oversized cards to leave with the voter so that they can track the process.  This is a volunteer-intensive voter outreach.  Each volunteer follows the 3-step process to ensure that voters' votes are counted.1 - Vote By Mail application filled and mailed.2- Paper Ballot received by voter and mailed. 3- Ballot received by the state/Board of Elections and counted.All labor has been generously donated and our volunteers will be door knocking to get this done.  This is our first batch and we will gauge the success of it and report back to donors.  Thank you and please donate and SHARE this.  Help us get the Democratic votes and help us to do what we can to defend our democracy.  Breakdown on costs:20,000 voter cards - $1110950 double-sides volunteer guides and 2850 Voter Tracker sheets - $387Shipping $375 voter cardsSubtotal $1872Excess of $128 will be used for gofundme's cut and shipping out of these kits to volunteers.If we are fortunate enough to collect more than our goal of $2000, we will use that to pay for clipboards, 9x11 envelopes, and postage that volunteers will need to mail back to us.  Any excess goes to voter education.Read more about us here:www.atnj.org/donate"

It is a program and panel of party leaders, activists, experts, and peacemakers We have raised $2,700 so far and we need to raise $6,500 more. This covers the costs of the Hilton Hotel meeting room, lunch for all attendees, speaker travel expenses, videographer, post-production, and ongoing outreach.Why are we doing this?The CDP can serve as a beacon for peace, justice, and understanding. Real leadership in this area requires the same innovative and progressive spirit that defines California Democrats. These polarizing times require understanding not demonization, participation not isolation, and earnest learning not damaging propaganda.If the California Democratic Party is to remain true to its values, we must not give way to the one-sided bigotry inherent in the BDS movement. Together we will seize this moment and lay claim to our power of collective endeavor in building a constructive peace through engagement. Only by working to build real peace and justice on the ground, only by creating cooperative, sustainable, and generative solutions, and only by innovation and perseverance can a lasting peace be achieved. Thank you!

This conversation, now more than ever, is a necessary one, and having it in front of young people receptive to the party but ultimately unsure of their political affiliation and allegiances is even more important. Is the Democratic Party still the party of the working class (and was it ever?) What does a leftist foreign policy look like? Does the party need to be tougher or more conciliatory? Are identity politics a weakness or a strength? Who are we, and what do we stand for? These are questions worth engaging and working through with different perspectives."

I am Jose Lopes Amaral. A Luso-Luxembourgian Photographer working as an Independent and Freelance Photojournalist and Documentary Photographer focusing on Social Issues, Human Rights and Unrests. On June 12, I went to cover a protest. I thought it would be just a protest like the others I already experienced, but I was wrong. I did not know that I was about to cover a very special moment that is suspected to be a turning point in history.  I was in Hong Kong for documenting my first demonstration against the ""New Extradition Law"" and saw the Hong Kong Police cracking down on protesters and journalists with pepper spray, tear gas, bean bags and rubber bullets. I experienced intimidation all day by some very aggressive police officers and I even had one of them pointing at me with one of this ""Tear Gas Guns"" after I helped two local photojournalists to get out of a tricky situation (police shoot at them with tear gas at a very close distance. Here is a  link  if you want to know more about this specific story: https://observers.france24.com/en/20190614-hong-kong-protests-photographer-police-viral ). After June 12 of 2019, I returned back to Hong Kong to cover two new protests.  Sheung Shui on July 13 and Sha Tin on July 14. I saw again, police losing control, repressing and cracking down on protesters, of course, these protesters started fighting back and if you follow the recent protests of Hong Kong you know the results.Between this period (June 12 and July 13, 2019), 4 young Hong Konger’s sacrificed their lives by jumping from buildings leaving letters or inscriptions on walls with very specific requirements for the future of Hong Kong and its people hoping that Carrie Lam (Hong Kong executive chef) would listen to them. But she did not do it. She never talked about them, she never showed regrets. Today, this law is set on the ice, but for the people of Hong Kong, fighting this law is no longer a priority. Today, Hong Kong people want democracy and universal suffrage.  Some even demand Independence. For you and me living in Western countries, we believe that our rights are granted. The people of Hong Kong thought the same. At least until they realized that the Chinese Government (CCP) had already begun to undermine these rights. I want to be one of the witnesses of this young generation that is fighting for a free Hong Kong and document this independence movement. I want to immortalize this moment in the history of Hong Kong and make it available for the next generations that are to come. Besides this  Photo Documentary Project I would like to publish a  book and why not an Exhibition (if there are any people that would like to collaborate on the book with me (combine text to the phots p.ex) let me know. But I have an issue... Documentary Photography is expensive to produce especially if you work as an independent/freelance Photographer like me. Each story I cover costs me airfare, lodging, equipment (helmet and Protections, Gas Mask), insurance, etc. All this keeps me from covering important stories like this one when they appear.But you can help me and contribute to this project by a donation and/or share this ""Go Fund ME Project"".  In return, I promise to do my best to document your cause and I also will be more than happy to offer you some  Prints from my Work.   You can see the total of my work on  www.joselopesamaral.com Thank You for your support in advance.

I have decided to run for the position of Executive Vice President of The Alabama Young Democrats for 2019 & 2020. As a result of being born and raised in the Heart of Dixie, I have witnessed the Partisanship and divides between Republicans & Democrats, some situations resulting in financial suffering of Alabamians and extreme cases violations of the civil rights of hard-working, taxpayers here in this Beautiful State. The values and policies of ""the good ole days"" have brought very little to the sake of progress, economic development, and bipartisan plan in our state. Its time to bring a voice that is willing to reach across both sides of the aisle, to unite our political system rather than divide. If elected to the position of Executive Vice President, I would be given a platform and voice that cannot be ignored by our elected representatives. With this voice, I can put issues such as reducing the cost of healthcare, eliminating the sales tax on groceries and prescription/ over the counter medications at the front of the AYD agenda. Advocate for fundamental civil rights, and push for more nondiscriminatory policies to protect hardworking minorities. Expand Economic Development by introducing new programs that provide education and job skill training in areas that suffer from poverty and systemic racial biases, therefore reducing the tax burden on the lower class.

Hello concerned citizens, We are a grassroots coalition of concerned citizens and we need your help.  We are worried that our Democratic Party Organizations have strayed too far away from following federal & state laws and organizational bylaws and rules.   For those that are not aware, we are seeking a Superior Court injunction order against our local and state Democratic Party organizations to enjoin (order) them to follow the rules they have adopted... ...But we need your help! The legal battle against those that wish to violate our right is just beginning, and we need legal and financial help.As many of us recognize, the Democrats did not follow their own rules in the 2016 Presidential Primary nominating process and now we have someone in the White House that we do not want there.  It is vital to our democracy that the Democratic Party organizations actually follow their own rules.  In Washington state, we have a law RCW 29A.80.051 that states: "" Rule-making authority Each political party organization may adopt rules governing its own organization and the non-statutory functions of that organization"". We are going to ask the courts to rule on whether or not once the party organization does adopt their own rules if they then MUST to follow those rules or if the executive board or other members can violate those rules at will and remove people without due process. Ultimately, if we can get the courts to rule that Washington State law requires major political party organizations to follow the rules they have adopted for their own organization, then we can force every single major party organization in our state to follow their own rules.  This could revolutionize the way political parties represent members and voters in our state. A victory like this  will put the power back in the hands of the people (the members of these organizations) and out of the hands of the ""oligarch"" that make decisions outside our laws and rules.  For more than 2 years now, we have been trying to get these local Democratic Party organizations to follow their own rules but they have been unable (or unwilling) to address and resolve these ongoing problems.  We have previously sought mediation with them. They refuse to mediate.   They stonewall us, ignore us, and try to harass and humiliate us while they refuse to follow their own rules.  It was at this point, we realized that we needed help from our larger community.  It appears these Democrats will only follow their own rules if the court orders them to follow their rules.********** IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**********WE ARE SEEKING AN IMMEDIATE TEMPORARY INJUNCTION TO REINSTATE AND PROTECT ONE OF OUR MEMBERS. On March 27, 2019, the 17th Legislative District Democrats (17th LD Dems) violated their own rules and removed a member from their organization with out due process, due notice, etc.  We want the courts to put a temporary restraining order in place so the member can be reinstated until the courts can hold a hearing on the larger issues. This member was accused of violating ""reasonably assumed privacy"" for posting copies of emails (with emails addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses listed on them).  Each email address, phone number, and address was already in the ""public domain"" before the member posted them publicly.  It would not be considered a violation understand law.  The Chair said they weren't basing it off state law.  When asking what they were basing it off the Chair could (or would) not answer.   It was a mockery of ""disciplinary process"". ********** IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**********We are ordinary working people going up against the financial might of the Washington State Democratic Central Committee (WSDCC) who is covering the legal costs of the CCDCC and 17th LD Dems.  The Washington Democrats have about a quarter of a million dollars on hand.  While this is not an easy task, we believe we must take action to ensure members' rights are NOT violated and that the Democratic Party organizations represent their members and the voters.  Donating to this cause will mean that we are able to defend our democracy, and that a solid defense of the rights of members can move forward. The funds we raise will be used  for the legal costs.   We are seeking: * a Temporary Injunction (Temporary Restraining Order = TRO)* a Preliminary Injunction,  * a Permanent Injunction * Declaratory Relief (non-monetary)We are looking for activist or public-interest lawyers willing to help us legally change our political landscape.   If you know of any civil rights lawyers near Portland, OR, please let us know.   Costs include:* Filing fees* Bond (required) * Copies* Costs of service of notices* Attorneys fees* other legal costsPlease donate if you can help cover legal costs.The money from this GoFundMe campaign will be used specifically to retain the lawyers, pay for all legal/court fees and all specific legal/expert advice and costs required to pursue this matter in the courts. We are looking for a court order to enjoin the 17th LD Dems, Clark County Democratic Central Committee (CCDCC),  and the Washington State Democratic Central Committee to follow their own rules and protect the rights of their own members.  This could set precedent throughout our state. It will mean so much for us to received your support to meet these goals.  It will tell us we aren't alone in our efforts for taking on the entire Democratic establishment.  We can make history together and we will be forever grateful to those who help us meet our collective goals for Party and government ethics.  To help us hold Washington State Democrats responsible for following their rules, please donate today.  To help get the word out, you can share the link to your Facebook timeline!As I'm sure you will appreciate, if this Injunction is awarded, the ramifications for political party members and voters will be enormous.   We need our community now more than ever, as it is only through your support that we can ensure Democrats follow their own rules and stop violating membership rights.  We continue to stand united against corruption of the Democratic Party rules and the rights of their members. We need funds immediately.

Republicans are buying ads on Facebook with lies and fake news.  Facebook changed its ad policies to allow politicians to buy ads, even with known lies, and Facebook refuses to take down ads with objectively false information.While Republicans are doing this already, and Facebook changed it's policies to help Conservatives, Democrats can and should fight back and fight fire with fire.AOC has asked Facebook's CEO Zuckerberg if she could buy ads on Facebook saying (falsely) that certain GOP candidates support and voted for the liberal Green New Deal - with the thinking that this would turn of hardcore conservatives and make them not want to vote for such candidates.  See cs.pn/2W2BqB2

Elizabeth Warren tested a fake ad (with a disclaimer at the end that it was fake) just to troll Facebook and prove a point.This GoFundMe is to support more ads by more Democrats and Independents & other politicians to help them buy fake ads on Facebook and other Social Media channels with similar policies to expose the hypocrisy  of these policies (and hopefully advocate for changes to these policies). https://www.newsweek.com/elizabeth-warren-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ads-1465086NOTE:  Political solicitations may not be allowed on GoFundMe, so if that's the case, we will repurpose these funds to comply without violating any terms, but without keeping the funds ourselves. For example, if these fake ads cannot be bought, whether that's because we succeeded and the policies are changed before the money is spent, or jus because GoFundMe rules do not permit, then the money will be donated to Democratic leaning organizations. And if political fundraising or donations are not permitted  by GoFundMe terms and policies at all, such that we cannot donate to Dem candidates or causes, then funds will be donated to charitable organizations with permitted goals, such as anti-gerrymandering or pro immigration charities.  If even that's also deemed too political to be eligible, we will find a reputable and deserving non-profit/charity for the funds.

$0 raised of $2,500                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/inland-empire-young-democrats,"Fontana, CA",Inland Empire Young Democrats,"Created April 25, 2019","Hi,I'm Jeremy Paul Ortiz, a proud citizen. I have never been more proud to be an American than I have been this year. Interning for a congressional representative has given me so much insight into the legislative process and what it means to represent the great people of this country. The feeling of helping out a constituent, be it an older veteran or a young single mother, is indescribable.  No matter the difference in opinion, or the way they vote, I’ve noticed that people turn to their representatives in times of need, and the gratitude and civility they show proves to me the importance of our democracy.Today, Joe Biden officially launches his 2020 campaign, and I believe the democratic field of candidates is now complete. So, I am beyond excited. I am excited for our democracy. Now that Joe is running, over 20 democrats are in the field, all vying up for a chance to go one on one with President Trump. I am excited because we as Americans have so many choices. Regardless of whether you plan to vote Democrat or Republican, we have a choice. We have choice between a myriad of Democrats and Republicans. We have a choice to elect who we believe will best represent us and our hopes and dreams. We have a choice to determine our future and the future of this country. Not many people around the world can say that, so I urge everyone to make your voices count, please vote and please tell your friends and family to vote.If you haven’t already noticed, I am very impassioned about political participation for, in my belief, our democracy is more true and complete when citizens participate in our government.  From sea to shining sea, there are youthful Americans who have great heart and great ideas but are plagued by poverty, lack of confidence, a platform, and any other number of reasons. For the great experiment that is American democracy to function successfully, every citizen must feel empowered to get involved and realize that they too can better the lives of both themselves and other citizens through participation. I believe that many Americans have great ideas for the future. I believe that when they think of their fellow Americans, only what good each American can produce comes to mind. I want to believe that they too imagine a better world for everyone and that the American Dream is attainable for anyone willing to try.So, this year, I will be starting a democratic volunteer group, the Inland Empire Young Democrats. I do so in the hopes of getting younger people to the polls and to get them to use their voices. With a brutal primary cycle and a historic election around the corner, we here in the Inland Empire can make a difference. Now this isn’t a chartered club, nor do I plan to have it chartered. Instead, I wish to build a group of volunteers who are ready to be involved in the next election. I want to push my volunteers to their local chartered clubs, city council meetings, and give them the courage to utilize their voice and stand up for what's right! It is my hope that I can build a successful group of volunteers who are willing to go above and beyond for themselves, their community, and our country! Through this GoFundMe, I hope to raise enough money to spread my message of the importance of political participation. I also want to raise enough to rent an office where like minded young citizens can go to speak their minds and as a resource center for use between now and the next election, and perhaps further. I have laid the foundations for the club, if anyone wishes to join the team, feel free to reach me at jeremypaulortiz@outlook.com.

I would like to donate $1,000 to each Democrat Senator or Congress person who shouts 'You lie!' at 'so-called president' Trump each time he lies during the upcoming State of the Union address.

I know this act is disrespectful and not in keeping with the traditions of Congress, but I do not care. If anyone deserves to be publicly called out for blatant, unashamed lying, it's the orange-face con-man.Please remember, in 2009, Rep. 'Joe' Wilson (R) yelled 'You lie!' at President Obama, and he was not punished or denounced by the Republicans in control of the House and Senate at the time, instead he was praised for 'speaking truth to power'. So be it.Members who yell 'You lie!' simultaneously can either share the single $1,000 donation, designate an individual 'winner' amongst themselves, or designate a charity.There are 45 Democrats in the Senate and 235 in the House, so we need $280,000 to offer each a $1,000 donation. They are encouraged to give this money to a charity if they feel the act of yelling during the SOTU address is unworthy of reward.All leftover money will be donated to Planned Parenthood.

We constructed a state-of-the-art, 18-foot-tall, steel-bollard border barrier that blocked one of the worst human- and drug-smuggling corridors in the El Paso Sector. The construction of this barrier immediately altered the entire region's flow of illegal drugs and illegal migrants coming into the United States. We have received an incredible outpouring of heartfelt thanks and support from local Border Patrol and other law enforcement officers who have corroborated the effectiveness of your border wall.It has been an incredible journey being able to help citizens of our country. We knew that the situation on the border was bad. But working on this project in Sunland Park and seeing the drug smuggling corridors made clear that the border security crisis is even worse than we thought.As you may remember when we formed the We Build the Wall 501c4 organization, we took on an important mission in addition to building sections of border wall. As I announced on January 11, 2019, “Our mission is to unite private citizens that share a common belief in providing national security for our Southern Border through the construction, administration and maintenance of physical barriers inhibiting illegal entry into the United States.” Uniting citizens who share our interest in border security requires reaching to like-minded citizens and educating the public about the need for border barriers. With those objectives in mind we held educational town hall events. Additionally, we hosted a nationally recognized immigration symposium, and brought in Donald Trump Jr to speak at our recently-completed wall. We have been working diligently to raise awareness of the humanitarian crisis at our border and unite all citizens who share our belief in the value of physical barriers on the border.But our most important mission remains building new sections of wall. We are deep into the planning of Projects #2 and #3, which are coming soon. Those sections of border wall will also have a major impact when completed. Both projects are complicated in nature and require a lot of extra planning before we break ground. We cannot release exact locations due to security concerns, but rest assured we are working hard to ensure no one can target us like we saw with our first construction phase. As with Project #1, we will begin building and get the job done without a lot of fanfare in advance.This is where we are today, and we look forward to sharing the exciting news about these projects soon.￼￼￼PROJECT 1 : Sunland Park, New MexicoSTATUS: COMPLETE COST: Estimated $6-$8 MILLION - FINAL COST TBDWE BUILT THE WALL!! Our first wall segment is complete just outside of El Paso Texas! We are now working on segment #2. Please keep donating we the people will provide border security for our citizens since Democrats are failing to protect our communities from the flow of illegal drugs and criminals. The first wall we built is GROUND ZERO for illegal drugs, migrants and human sex slaves coming across, as you can see in the video. Your generous donations had a direct impact where the US Army Corps of Engineers said it was ""Impossible to Build""  and we were informed it would take roughly 2 years and $40 Million to complete had it been contracted out to the government to build. We completed it in a matter of days and for a FRACTION of the cost, literally moved a mountain to get it built and up a sharp incline at 31% grade. Proving once again ""We The People"" can unite in a time of crisis to get the job done!The one thing I've learned after losing three limbs in war is that NOTHING is impossible, and just as so many said ""you can't do that"" or ""building the wall privately is impossible""  our team just proved them all wrong! It's now up to We The People to ensure that we protect this nation for future generations. In this small section of border US Border Patrol public affairs office stated that over 1000 people cross each day on average, and over $200k-$300k worth of illegal drugs enter America. This is a vital smuggling route for the most ruthless cartel, the Juarez Cartel. Who murdered thousands of innocent civilians and journalist and trafficked sex slaves across our border.  WE ARE STOPPING THEM NOW! MAIL CHECK DONATION TO: WeBuildtheWall, Inc.PO Box 131567 Houston, Texas 77219-1567Now WATCH THIS VIDEO: ￼￼￼PROJECTS 2 & 3 : WILL ANNOUNCE LOCATION WHEN CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETESTATUS: CONTRACTING PHASE COST: TBD --------------------------------------------------------My name is Brian Kolfage and I'm a triple-amputee war veteran. I take the security of the American people very seriously which is how I find myself building wall on the southern border. If you are sick and tired of watching politicians in both parties obstructing President Trump's plan to build a wall on our southern border, then you've come to the right place. We The People are coming together to start building segments of Border wall wall on private property and the best part is, we're going to do it for a fraction of what it costs the government. To help me got the job done I've attracted a team of brilliant and accomplished Americans that includes Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach who many people think will be President Trump's next choice to head the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees the Border Wall). It's an impressive group who I'm proud to be working with everyday to start getting your wall built. Even the New York Times had to report that President Trump gave our project his blessing.Doubters have been trying to convince the American people who want a wall and helped us come this far, that they'll never get the protection along the border that we promised. However, their efforts have failed once again. While they were trying to prevent our progress, we were several steps ahead of them in our extensive preparations to build the wall.You may have seen misleading stories that GoFundMe kicked us off their platform and refunded everyone's money. It's not true which is why you can still click to donate right here on this GoFundMe page. The total amount raised represents the total amount we've raised in pledges and contributions on GoFundMe and from off-platform sources like checks and transfers. ￼￼￼How much do we still need to raise? In a word, more. We are still calculating the cost of building on every piece of land that a private landowner would allow us to build your wall on and other land we could potentially acquire or build on. We currently have the resources to begin building several segments that will stretch across several miles of the border but our goal is to keep fighting until the ENTIRE border is secure. If we have to raise billions to get the job done, that's what we're going to do. We are building the wall mile by mile, section by section for a FRACTION of the cost that the US government is paying. One of the most rewarding parts of leading this project has been getting to know the Angel Families who have lost loved-ones at the hands of illegal aliens who had no business being here in the first place. Their stories are heart wrenching and they serve as potent reminder of what's at stake. It's time to put a stop to the open border carnage.If you are still debating whether or not to donate, I encourage you to watch this video below of We Build The Wall Board members and Angel Families Steve Ronnebeck and Mary Ann Mendoza.

$488,355 raised of $600,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/support-brett-kavanaugh,"Ocean Isle Beach, NC",Brett Kavanaugh's Family,"Created September 24, 2018","
Updated information: When the money started coming in for this GoFundMe, it was at a crucial point in the confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh. The mainstream media was doing everything in its power to destroy him; Democrats were going all-in to stop him and whether he’d be confirmed or not was really up in the air. When it mattered most, over 13,000 people stood up for a good man who was being attacked. We sent a message not just to the media and the Republicans in the Senate who needed to stiffen their spines, but to the Kavanaugh team when it really mattered.I've spoken to a former clerk for Judge Kavanaugh who told me that Kavanaugh’s supporters loved the outpouring of support from this GoFundMe. When Kavanaugh was getting torn apart in front of the world, that person told me that seeing the numbers go up on this GoFundMe really lifted their spirits when it mattered. The clerk I spoke to told me they were aware of this when it was at $20,000 and they were amazed it had gotten that high. So, when it started to really climb and they ultimately saw that more than 13,000 people contributed, they were just blown away by all the support for the Judge.Similarly, that former law clerk told me that because of judicial ethics restraints, Justice Kavanaugh and his family cannot accept or direct the funds. With that in mind, here is the official statement I received, which I assume more than a few lawyers were involved with crafting: ""Justice Kavanaugh did not authorize the use of his name to raise funds in connection with the GoFundMe campaign. He was not able to do so for judicial ethics reasons. Judicial ethics rules caution judges against permitting the use of the prestige of judicial office for fund-raising purposes. Justice Kavanaugh will not accept any proceeds from the campaign, nor will he direct that any proceeds from the campaign be provided to any third party. Although he appreciates the sentiment, Justice Kavanaugh requests that you discontinue the use of his name for any fund-raising purpose.""The last thing any of us want is for our attempt to help Judge Kavanaugh’s family to be used against him. Given the strictness of the ethics rules and the possibility that the Judge could get in trouble if he’s tied to this in any way, I made it clear that we wouldn’t want a public “Thank you” that could potentially be used against him. That being said, we’ve been waiting for direction from the Judge’s family on what to do with the money and what they are saying is that they are not allowed to give us any direction at all. So, what do we do? In a perfect world, I’d just give the money to the Judge’s family or set up a college fund for his kids, but again we don’t want to turn this incredible effort to help the Judge’s family into a tool that can be used to hurt him.  With that in mind, from the very beginning, this GoFundMe has noted that if the Kavanaugh family can’t or won’t be able to take the money, we’d give it to a charity of their choice.Since they are not allowed to suggest a charity, I did some research on charities supported by the Judge and settled on the Archdiocese of Washington which runs the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO). Brett Kavanaugh rather famously coached girls’ basketball there and if the Kavanaugh family were allowed to support a charity, I feel confident the Archdiocese of Washington would be near the top of the list. After talking to the Archdiocese of Washington about the best way to use the funds to help the sort of kids Brett Kavanaugh has been working with, we’re going to split the money between three of their programs: The Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) , the Tuition Assistance Fund , and the Victory Youth Center . With that in mind, I talked with GoFundMe and explained that I’d like to see the money go to this charity. If for some reason, you don’t want your money to go to that charity, you will have a week from today to ask for a refund from GoFundMe here: https://tinyurl.com/y7zbwogf   Additionally, GoFundMe, which has been incredibly helpful behind the scenes, provided a list of all the comments people made. After screening out the trolls, I want you to know that all of those have been sent to the Judge’s family. So, if they didn’t get to read those comments while you were leaving them, they will certainly get to see them now. I’m sure all those kind words will mean a lot to them. Last but not least, folks, this GoFundMe has been a TREMENDOUS success. We were able to show support for Judge Kavanaugh in his hour of need and raise an enormous amount of money for a charity that has obviously meant a lot to him. Everyone who contributed should be extremely proud to be a part of this. Original information:Like many decent people from both parties, I have been disgusted by the unsubstantiated 36 year old smears aimed at Brett Kavanaugh. We live in a country where innocent until proven guilty is supposed to mean something; yet Brett Kavanaugh's reputation is being dragged through the mud while his family is facing non-stop death threats. This is a horrible way to treat a good man who has dedicated his life to public service. So many unethical people are giving unprovable 36 year old accusations the same weight as 6 FBI background checks, hundreds of hours of hearings and testimony under oath. It is disgraceful.What I'd like to do is raise money for Brett Kavanaugh's family to use for security or however they see fit. All of the money collected will go to Brett Kavanaugh's family or alternately, if they refuse to accept it, to a charity of their choice. I have already reached out to a contact who should be able to put me in touch with Brett Kavanaugh's family. If he can't do it, I have plenty of other contacts who should be able to make it happen. I will update this page after I have talked with his family.  I hope you will show your support for a good man who has been treated very, very badly. Update: I have heard some people say that Brett Kavanaugh is rich and so his family doesn't need the money. That's actually not correct. According to Market Watch, ""Brett Kavanaugh may become the ‘poorest’ Supreme Court justice .""Update #2: Some people have asked who I am and how they know that the Kavanaugh family will get the money. My name is John Hawkins. You can read about me here on Right Wing News. My identity has been verified by both Twitter  and Facebook.  I do weekly columns at PJ Media and have a book out. I am not someone who can fade into the background, so when I tell you that the Kavanaugh family will decide what happens to the money, that is what will happen.  I have also been in regular contact with a representative of GoFundMe. All funds will be held by GoFundMe until the family has been contacted and a clear plan has been agreed upon.Update #3: I've reached out to Kavanaugh's family through three different people and I also called his office and spoke to a secretary about this today. I will let everyone know after I have gotten in touch with them. Update #4: I have a well connected contact who says he can get me in touch with Kavanaugh's team. When I have guidance from Kavanaugh's family, I will update. Also, congrats on taking this fund raiser over $50,000 while Judge Kavanaugh was giving his powerful testimony during the hearing. I'm proud of the success we've had and the support we've shown for the judge's family. Update #5: I have continued reaching out to the judge's family through different sources, but haven't yet had any luck reaching them. It has occurred to me that they may not want to be reached until after the judge's confirmation vote, which would be very understandable. In any case, I will continue reaching out to the judge's family until I get an answer from them. Last but not least, with everything Judge Kavanaugh is being put through, it is fantastic to see so many people publicly showing their support for his family. Update #6: The original goal was $100,000. I upped that to $125,000 and then $150,000. After that, I went up to $250,000 and it looks like we're about to blow past that number as well. It is amazing to see so many good people supporting the family of a good man who has been treated so poorly and I am sure they will be very excited when they see all the support that they've gotten. Update #7: I have continued reaching out to Brett Kavanaugh's family via multiple sources including his office and his lawyer, Beth Wilkinson. I have yet to hear back. As I noted earlier, he may just have too much going on right now to deal with this and we may not get an answer until after the vote. I have also consulted with a lawyer about whether his family has the option of taking this money. The first one told me that he did have that option, but we did not end up working together because his fee was way out of my price range. So, I have reached out to another campaign finance lawyer recommended by a friend and am waiting for a 2nd opinion. If there are any lawyer fees, those fees will come out of my pocket, not out of the fund. All of the money provided by GoFundMe will go to the Kavanaugh family or a charity of their choice. When I know more, I will make sure to update the page. Additionally, if you have any questions that aren't answered here, you can reach me at rightwingnews -at- gmail.com or on Twitter .Update #8: Unfortunately, in the last day there have been a lot of horrible human beings smearing the judge and saying grotesque things in the comments. I don't want his family exposed to that and realistically, since I am the only person with access to the account, I cannot effectively moderate it 24x7. Also, after discussing this issue with GoFundMe, I was told that there is no option to allow only people that have donated to comment. With that in mind, I will have to turn the comments off. I hate to do that, but it seems like the best option. On the upside, GoFundMe did tell me that they can, ""provide a spreadsheet of all the comments actual donors left before this point should they want to read those that are supportive. "" So, if you want to leave a private comment, the judge's family will still see it. Update #9: I have now talked to a staffer for the judge who has told me that they are aware of the GoFundMe. She was extremely appreciative of all the support people have been giving the judge, but did also say, quite understandably, that it may be a little while before we get an answer on this with everything that's going on. I told her that was absolutely fine and that the money would be here when they're ready to decide how to handle it, which I assume will be after the vote. Update #10: Assuming Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court today, I plan to close the GoFundMe. At that point, we'll just be waiting for word from the judge's family on how he wants to handle all this. Once I get that information and any message from the judge's family that they want passed on, I will update here. Update #11: As I have noted, Kavanaugh's staff is aware of this GoFundMe and is grateful for the contributions. At this point, we are just waiting for the Kavanaugh family to make a decision on what to do with the money. Keep in mind that after the vote, he probably took a couple of days to just soak it in. He has also had preparations for starting on the Supreme Court to deal with and it would not surprise me if they need to consult with a lawyer and an accountant before they make a decision. Because of that, it may still take a little while before we get a decision. I promise to keep you updated and all the money is still sitting there and waiting for them. None has been or will be withdrawn until they decide what they want to do.  Update #12: I have been in contact with a representative of the Kavanaugh family and one of the judge's clerks. Once they send me what they want to do in writing, which should be in the next couple of days, I will pass on a message from the family, talk with GoFundMe and announce their decision.

The response to this effort has been incredible. The second ad went in the Portland Press Herald today! If I can raise enough money, I will do it again next week! Thank you so much for your support. Let's keep the momentum going!I’m raising money to pay for a full-page ad in the Maine Sunday Telegram, asking Senator Collins to start listening to average Mainers and not just the big money donors who support her.  I’ve paid for one ad by putting it on my credit card, but I’m asking for your help to keep it going.Here’s how I got here:On a recent flight from Washington, D.C. to Portland, I was happy to see Senator Susan Collins in the boarding area. I approached her and politely introduced myself as a constituent. She invited me to sit down. I told her that I was struggling with how to explain the current situation in Washington to my children. How do I explain to them that a president is breaking the law and getting away with it? How do I teach them the importance of respecting one another when the president is openly hostile and discriminatory? And how do I explain the president's misogyny to my daughter? Senator Collins responded by lamenting the breakdown of civility in Washington. I listened politely for any mention of Trump, but it did not come. I then asked more pointed questions about Trump and his racism, sexism, anti-semitism, and other examples of his bigotry. She told me she was not aware of any recent tweets that disrespected woman. Astonished, I asked whether it mattered? He is openly hostile toward women, minorities, immigrants, democrats, Muslims, the LGBT community…we know how he feels. How do I explain his to my children?Her response was simply, “Sir, I can’t respond to that.”  I disagreed that she could not respond. I told her it was her job to respond. I pushed further and pointed out that President Trump has solicited election interference from Ukraine and then (on television) from China. Did she think this was a crime? Again, “Sir, I can’t comment on that.”  But, I said, you must have an opinion. Do you believe it is okay for a president to solicit election interference from a foreign power?At this she said, “We clearly have different beliefs."" I responded that I suspected that she was right, but pointed out that she still hadn’t told me hers.Before I left, I told her I was deeply disappointed in her appointment of Brett Kavanaugh and her unwillingness to speak out about the corruption in the Trump administration. I told her that I was angry about her silence in the middle of a national crisis.We parted agreeing to disagree. But on the jet bridge, I heard Senator Collins tell someone that a constituent had been rude to her. I approached her again and explained that it was not my intention to be rude. It was my intention to engage in the work of a democracy - something that she was unwilling to do.Susan Collins represents the interests of Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump and her big money donors. She has stopped listening to the people of Maine. Help us raise money to continue running ads in Maine newspapers holding Senator Collins accountable for her actions and demanding that she listen to her constituents."

Washington state government is trying to drive me out of politics. Permanently.  If they are successful, who will dare to run initiatives to keep them accountable? They will have unchecked power to run this state into the ground!Fascism:  “A government system that forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism.”My name is Tim Eyman.I’m a battle tested conservative political activist. For 20 years, I’ve sponsored and qualified 16 statewide initiatives for a public vote. Voters have approved 10 of them. Those successful tax initiatives have saved taxpayers over $40 billion  so far. Liberals despise me because I am a relentless advocate for conservative values in such a liberal Seattle-centric state. And no matter how much they attack me, the initiatives we sponsor consistently win at the ballot box. It drives them crazy.Why do I need help?Washington state’s Attorney General — Democrat Bob Ferguson — is attacking me and my family.This is the same Democrat AG who’s constantly suing President Trump (35 times), suing a grandmother for not doing the flowers at a gay wedding, suing a high school football coach for praying after games, and suing other conservatives.Ferguson is running for governor in 2020 and he figures that suing conservatives like me will impress the crazy liberals in his party. His lawsuit against me seeks to impose on me a lifetime ban on all future political activity. That’s right — his stated purpose is to stop me from doing initiatives for the rest of my life. This is political persecution.Last year at his splashy press conference, the AG announced he was going after me and wants a $2.1 million fine and a lifetime ban on all future political activity by me.My attorney responded: “For all the heated rhetoric earlier today, this dispute is simple: whether two transactions from 5 years ago needed to be included on 2012’s campaign reports. The Attorney General believes they should, we do not. From the beginning, Mr. Eyman has made clear he did nothing wrong … It is chilling that the stated purpose of this action is to permanently bar him from participating in the political process in this State.”Ferguson's legal costs are zero because taxpayers are paying for his lawyers…while I had to privately fund-raise to pay for mine.FOR MORE DETAILED INFO: www.timdefense.com Listen to a recent Lars Larson radio interview with me here: Why should you help me?If they are successful, who knows where they will stop!

My wife is a strong woman who has faced indescribably difficult challenges in her life, so I know she’ll make it through it. But she’s a private person who focuses her energies on being a full-time mom to three great but challenging kids and being a wife to a husband who’s a 24/7/365 political activist. She’s got her hands full focusing on family, not politics.Ferguson’s attack on my wife is deeply offensive. What he’s doing to her shows what a small, petty, soulless little man he is.Here’s a little more about my family.We Never Give Up. For two decades, we’ve built an incredibly effective team of heroic people who are committed to restraining the government’s insatiable tax appetite year after year. We’ve had a string of successes unparalleled in our state’s history. And we’ve shown that even our occasional setbacks never stop us from trying again. And again. And again  (read a great story about that here).That persistence & experience & success must be terrifying to a power-hungry politician who’s gunning to be governor. Hence, his push for a lifetime ban and his harassment of my wife.As soon as this witch hunt started, it was obvious it was gonna be brutally expensive and financially ruinous to me and my family. We don’t have the financial resources to fight this on our own.If you are a conservative or a libertarian or a person who thinks that such things should not be allowed to continue, I ask for your support — because I’m in a battle with such forces right now, and with your help, I know we can win.Please feel free to contact me with any questions: tim_eyman@comcast.netFOR MORE DETAILED INFO: www.timdefense.comNow that the AG has forced me to file bankruptcy, I really need your help.

An anti-war rally was held at West Potomac park near the Lincoln Memorial where 70,000 people had gathered for a concert by musician and peace activist Phil Ochs. Both groups joined together and marched; this action was to be known as the March on the Pentagon.  During 1967 there were numerous anti-war marches across the nation in all major cities including New York, Boston, San Francisco and Washington, DC. These actions and the protests and demos of the 1968 presidential elections would lead to the call for a general strike which culminated in the mobilization of 500,000 protestors in another march on the Pentagon known as the Vietnam Moratorium which took place on October 15, 1969. A month later, due to the success of the first march, another rally was held.   On October 7th, 2001, the US invaded Afghanistan under the pretext of apprehending those behind the attacks on the Twin Towers in 2001. US forces have remained in active occupation, making the illegal and immoral war in Afghanistan the longest foreign occupation in US history. In response to ongoing US military aggression across the globe and the continuing bi-partisan increases in Pentagon funding we are calling for a 21st century March on the Pentagon on the 51st anniversary of the massive 1967 march and all the subsequent marches. The bloated military budget is draining our communities and families dry of precious blood and treasure while decimating nations and peoples who have done nothing to us.  The title, “Women’s March on the Pentagon” is in direct response to a leader in the recent women’s march who said,  “I appreciate that war is YOUR issue Cindy, but the Women’s March will NEVER address the war issue as long as women aren’t free.”  It is the belief of many of us that NO woman is free while the US spends trillions of dollars bombing millions and militarily occupying over 150 countries around the world.  Our demands are simple: The complete end to the wars abroad; closure of foreign bases; dramatically slash the Pentagon budget to fund healthy social programs here at home: the only good empire is a gone empire. The antiwar/peace, anti-Imperialist voice has been shut out of, or marginalized by many protests and movements especially since Trump was inaugurated. We are in solidarity with most social and environmental movements, yet many refuse to address war and the preparations for war. War affects us all in one way or another. War destroys the natural environment. This March will not degenerate into a Get out the Vote Rally for the complicit Democrats. The ""nuclear clock"" is at two minutes to midnight, and with the threat of nuclear annihilation becoming an incomprehensible reality, WE MUST MARCH FOR PEACE AND AGAINST THE WAR MACHINE. To create a space in which to connect the dots of US Militarism back to the liberation and emancipation of all people around the world and to reverse the effects that the US War Machine has on the degradation of the environment we call for endorsement of this action. Although the working title is “Women’s March on the Pentagon” we invite all participation. At the moment our only web presence is on Facebook at: Women’s March on the Pentagon. We are furiously catching up with the excitement generated by the initial proposal. We are also planning on calling for solidarity marches around the world to march, or rally in front of military installations, US embassies, or war profiteers for those who cannot make it to the March on the Pentagon. Website (under construction): MarchonPentagon.com"

The Architect: The Political Assassination of Don Siegelman Please donate today!----------------------------------------------------------------------""Don Siegelman isn’t just fighting for his freedom; he’s fighting for the integrity of our democracy”           – Al Gore, Former Vice PresidentFormer Alabama Governor Don Siegelman believed in a judicial system that completely failed him.  “America’s Political Prisoner #1.”             -  American Trial Lawyers MagazineAs many of you know, Don was a popular Democrat who’d won every statewide office in Alabama before he was railroaded into jail by the most notorious name in American politics – Karl Rove. This film has the potential to make a major impact on politics by exposing the corrupt, immoral tactics used by Republican operatives that are responsible for putting this innocent man in jail.The FilmWe will reveal the dark underbelly of Republican politics. It will explain how Karl Rove used his senior executive position in the Bush White House to “get rid of Siegelman” because Republicans simply couldn’t beat him at the polls. Rove began by arranging for loyal Republican operatives, and Siegelman’s political adversaries, to be appointed as federal prosecutors. The federal prosecutor that indicted Gov. Siegelman (Leura Canary) was married to the campaign manager of his opponent (Bill Canary)! Those prosecutors quickly indicted Siegelman with fake, made-up charges alleging actions that, according to hundreds of legal experts – both Republican and Democrat – have never been crimes in the history of American jurisprudence. Then, to make those false charges stick, a Republican “hanging judge"" with numerous personal, political, and financial conflicts was suspiciously selected to preside over the trial. Before the trial, Gov. Siegelman caught Mark Fuller misappropriating over $300,000 in state retirement funds.  The embarrassed Fuller, now a federal judge, vowed payback. Fuller got his chance when he was assigned to preside over Gov. Siegelman's trial.  Inside this excessively biased courtroom, Rove's henchmen got away with a staggering array of judicial misconduct: lying to the jury, bribing the judge, scripting witness testimony, threatening the witness if he didn’t comply, multiple improper jury instructions, jury tampering, and allowing admittance of false evidence. Under threat of impeachment, Judge Mark Fuller resigned from the federal bench for beating his wife.  An investigation found that he had beat his wife on numerous occasions and lied to investigators.  There was no way possible for Siegelman to get a fair trial because the only official oversight at Justice was under Rove's control. With Karl Rove's client, the former Alabama Attorney General on the court of appeals, it is little wonder that Gov. Siegelman's appeals for justice have been resoundingly denied.“The conviction and sentence of Governor Siegelman has been a travesty of justice.”            -  Judge U.W. Clemon, Federal Judge (Ret.)“They could not beat him fair and square. This is a Republican state (Alabama), and he was the one Democrat they could never get rid of.”                          - Grant Woods (R), AR Attorney General 1991-99Don Siegelman Unjustly Remains in PrisonDespite being one of the most popular and respected figures in Alabama with decades of unblemished public service, Don Siegelman’s life has been devastated. He’s been away from his family for years. Siegelman has been completely stripped of his freedom and lost everything including his home, his savings, and a very promising career. He has endured more hardship than most of us can imagine, even though hundreds of America’s top legal experts say he never committed a crime.Since his conviction, countless Democrats and Republicans have formally declared their support for Don's innocence. Most notably, 113 former states’ Attorneys General from both political parties signed a formal petition protesting the rampant prosecutorial misconduct and judicial abuse in this trial. This is the first time in American history that so many legal experts have come forward to condemn the deliberate injustice directed at a single person.Our Filmmaking Team The film will be produced and directed by Steve Wimberly. Steve’s credits include numerous documentaries and television shows featured on Discovery Networks, HGTV and the Food Channel.

This lawsuit is the biggest attack on freedom of speech and constitutional rights in decades.The DNC does not allege WikiLeaks participated in hacking of any kind. It is suing WikiLeaks for providing accurate, newsworthy information to the public. The emails published by WikiLeaks reveal that the Clinton campaign worked with the DNC to rig the primary election and to engage in elaborate money laundering schemes. Astonishingly, the DNC claims that the emails of its political operatives are ""trade secrets"" –  as if the DNC's rigging efforts were the equivalent to the secret formula for Coca-Cola. With this suit, the DNC has become a press freedom predator, attempting to abuse trade secret law to suppress public understanding.Senior Democrats from Donna Brazile to Senator Elizabeth Warren agree that the primary was 'rigged' by the DNC. The top five officers of the DNC, including its president Debbie Wasserman-Shultz, resigned over the issue.The DNC might argue that it can sue the Trump campaign, or even the alleged leakers. What it cannot be permitted to do is sue the publisher who revealed its improper conduct.James Goodale, the First Amendment lawyer who defended the New York Times for publishing the Pentagon Papers, said the DNC 'paid zero attention to the First Amendment ramifications of their suit '. The Committee to Project Journalists warned , 'By suing WikiLeaks, DNC could endanger principles of press freedom'.The Democratic National Committee has billionaire backers to be able to fight the lawsuit in court for years. WikiLeaks, in contrast, is an award winning small publisher entirely funded by its readers.     This is a David and Goliath struggle. But as history shows, you should never bet against WikiLeaks. In the twelve years since it was founded it has never lost a court case and never retracted a publication.Help WikiLeaks stand up to the DNC and protect your fundamental rights."

Although I always had strong opinions on issues and voted in elections, I was never politically active in my first 30 years of life. Cut to the election of 2016 and a conversation with my incredibly wise grandmother, who said: ""Well, honey...I understand that you're upset, and that's okay. But now what are you going to do about it?"" I took her words to heart and jumped head-first into a world I knew nothing about -- politics -- and haven't looked back.Since taking that first leap in December 2016, I have served (and continue to serve) as the Communications Director for Madison County Democratic Women, a member of the Madison County Democratic Executive Committee,  a board member for Rocket City Young Democrats, a volunteer for the Doug Jones for Senate  campaign, an organizer for the Huntsville Women's March, a member of the AL State Democratic Executive Committee, and the campaign manager for AL State Senate District 2 candidate, Amy Wasyluka. I am so incredibly grateful for these opportunities and to those who have helped me get to where I am today. Through these opportunities, I have developed a deep passion for this world and a genuine desire to be a part of the change I wish to see in the world.And for those who know me well, you know how incredibly difficult it is for me to ask for help. But here I am -- nevertheless -- asking.I have recently been accepted into this incredible week-long training program -- Becker Digital Strategies - Digital Organizing Bootcamp  -- which will be held August 12-18. This program is an amazing opportunity to learn from some of the best digital trainers in the country to hone and elevate my skills to a level where I can be more effective in my current positions, help more organizations and campaigns, share my knowledge with others, and -- hopefully -- make a career out of it.With all that being said, training of this level is unfortunately not free (or cheap). I did apply for and receive the highest scholarship amount for this particular program, but the remaining cost is still $1,500 and due by July 1. And as a Millennial with very little disposable income to begin with who just closed on their first house (yay home-ownership!?), that's a hefty price tag to pay all on my own. SO...if you are sympathetic to my cause at all, I would so greatly appreciate your support, whatever the amount.As I stated in the beginning, asking for help is something I am not at all comfortable with, but with the encouragement of my (phenomenal) inner circle, I am reaching out to ask for your help in achieving this goal in order to gain the knowledge and experience necessary to take this next big step in my life and my career path.

I ask that you read the story below and if you can, forward it to anyone that may be able to help the Blekic family. As of now, the Blekic family has been deported to Bosnia. Money raised is helping the family survive, as there are no jobs available and to pay for lawyer fees in the states helping to get the family back to the United States.  As the funds become available, I will be moving the funds to Amra Blekic to help pay for these expenses.Amra, and her husband Elivr are from Bosnia. They came to the U.S. on a visitor visa in 2008 to join Elvir’s family who already lived here as US citizens. The Blekic family applied for asylum, citing fears of returning to Bosnia as it was embroiled in a civil war. Their daughter Medina was 8 and her sister, Jenna, was 12. While waiting for asylum, the girls started school and their parents began building a life in the Jacksonville area. Amra and her husband own a janitorial service company and Amra manages a restaurant franchise.They have continued to meet all the requirements to stay in the US legally with the hope of becoming permanent US residents. In 2014, they were given a deportation order and their appeal for asylum was denied as the situation in Bosnia had changed. They were also given an order of supervision and repeated stays of removal which allowed Amra and her husband to continue working and the girls to continue to attend school. Their oldest daughter currently attends university and has recently gotten married. Their 18-year-old daughter, Medina will graduate from high school this month with a 3.5 GPA. She had dreams of attending university and serving in the US Navy as an anesthesiologist.Last year their stay of removal was denied and Amra and her husband had the choice of wearing ankle bracelets or being taken into custody. They chose to wear the bracelets and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials told them they could stay until Medina graduated from high school.The family has worked with an immigration lawyer for years and they have sought help from their senators and congressmen, both republican and democrat. They have exhausted all legal means to stay in the US and now have a deportation order which requires them to leave the US by 6/25/18.The Blekic have applied for a visa to move to Canada, but it won’t be granted unless they have jobs.If you feel compelled to help in anyone, I encourage you to donate and to share this Gofundme page.Thank you!"

Anyone who knows Nabor knows that he is not one to complain or to be put down by something like this, yet his family wanted him around for all that life continues to have in-store and were praying for a miracle. Insert Kathy Buttle and family!Kathy’s Story:“As you know, John (Kathy’s husband) has lost a kidney and his other one is only working at 25%. At 20%, he may need a kidney transplant. I thought I would be the one to donate. Then I found out he is type O which means only a person with type O can donate to him and I am type A.Along the road, we have visited with Dale and Lana Hummermeier. Lana had donated a kidney to a good friend of theirs, Bob Ellis. Lana had said that other than a short recovery, she had felt no effects. She gave me the confidence to donate.In the meantime, a guy that Josh works with was having kidney problems. Nabor Guzman is an old bull rider so we knew of him but not well. Josh (Kathy’s son) talked about him all the time, what a great guy he is and how he suffers more than he lets on. Nabor needed a kidney and we are both type A! So, why not???!!! Kind of a pay it forward. I will help Nabor and then someone will help John if necessary.I started the testing process and found out just how healthy I am! Then the bump in the road. During a CT, they found cysts on my pancreas. No big deal, just needed an MRI. John and I drove to Denver last Sunday, got the MRI and came home. On Monday, the nurse called and said the cysts were IPMN and precancerous! Not what I wanted to hear, especially when we were in Walmart getting our flu shots at the time. I was scared, anxious and afraid that meant the end of the donation.... The bad news I referenced earlier. Nabor, his wife Sally, Josh, Lacy, and a few family and friends I told were so supportive. I told myself to quit the pity party, that Nabor was the loser not me. In fact, they don't usually find these cysts until it is too late because there are no symptoms. Nabor had just saved my life! That leads up to just a few minutes ago!!! I got a call from the Transplant Center. IT'S A GO!!! My cysts are not going to stop the transplant. They will watch them and if then deal with them if they change. They are low risk. I am over the moon on both accounts, the transplant going ahead and the fact that my cysts are not going to kill me. Please pray for me and Nabe. I know he and I will both be fine but thoughts and prayers don't hurt. I thank God for Lana giving me the courage to do this. I thank God for Nabor who has not only been a good friend to Josh but without him, I would have never known about my little ""guests"". I ask one more favor from all my family and friends. Don't say things like Atta boy Girl or whatever. Instead, make sure you are a donor on your driver's license. Donate if you can. Give blood. A funny story about all this, Josh had told Nabor that if he got a kidney from me, he might sit down while he pees. Nabe thought he could do that. Josh said and now you will be related to Steve From. Nabe said he didn't mind coming to our family reunions. Josh said and you know, Mom is a Democrat! Nabe had to think on that one a while.....”Kathy and Nabor’s surgeries have officially been scheduled for November 12th! Please keep both of these amazing people and their families in your thoughts and prayers, and pray that all goes well with their surgeries.  Funds will go to both families to help cover medical expenses and any other financial stresses that may accompany this process while both Nabor and Kathy recover from their surgeries. Your donation is incredibly appreciated!"

In response, we've altered our campaign to support ALL THE WOMEN, and will be reaching out to their legal teams immediately to find out what level of financial support they require. _____________________________________ We believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford...On Sunday, September 16th, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, an academic and a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University, bravely shared her story of assault and attempted rape in the 1980s at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, a former Bush Administration official, current circuit court judge, and current nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.Now, the GOP is out to smear her.This story is not new. In 1991, Professor Anita Hill bravely stepped forward during the confirmation hearings of now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who she credibly accused of sexual harassment. The GOP, and even some Democrats, attacked Hill’s credibility, and Thomas was confirmed.We can’t let this happen again. We can’t allow Dr. Christine Blasey Ford be demeaned or discredited for telling her story. We must all support her against vicious and vile attacks on her character. We must all assist her with any legal bills she will incur. If victims of rape and sexual assault are to come forward, they must be supported in every way.There are many reasons Brett Kavanaugh is ill-suited to be a Supreme Court Justice. But this is the last straw. We, the people, cannot allow Brett Kavanaugh to be confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. We are a coalition of organizations, movement leaders and individuals engaged in the fight to stop this nomination. We, the people, stand with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. We, the people, support her in her efforts to tell her story and to be heard.Please donate generously to ensure Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has the resources needed for her legal and communications strategy. We are not raising any money for our organizations. We are raising funds to go directly to Dr. Blasey Ford. The conservative machine is launching a full scale attack including death threats.

One is serving time; another will enter his plea on June 25th. A third was arrested on Friday for standing in my vestibule and telling people I was a ""baby killer"" and asking where I could be found. I got a photo of her and the police arrived soon, only to be told by her that she was ""saving lives."" I have been given a guard five days a week to accompany me on errands, but I will not have his services in July. Bottom line: I need to hire a guard. Here is the full story of why I brought suit against three members of the GOP. In the late summer of 2016, a Facebook post of mine, in which I wrote of how Hillary Clinton, as my senator in New York, helped me with collection efforts related to cancer treatment I was receiving, was shared and re-shared thousands of times and ultimately went viral. Media outlets picked up the story, and I heard from Hillary Clinton. This apparently enraged some particularly virulent Republicans, who then illegally seized my accounts under the guise of an ""investigation."" They were convinced that my story of cancer and no insurance and a New York hospital threatening to withhold my treatments until I paid past costs was fabricated, and my memory of Hillary Clinton straightening things out for me was a lie intended to improve her image with the public. I must have--I surely was--paid for this story from either her campaign or the Clinton Foundation, so slanderous comments appeared on stories about me and Ms. Clinton, and my accounts remained unavailable to me and ""under scrutiny"" for eight months.I sued. I directly sued the three members of our Congress who authorized this ""investigation."" It was bold and right, but costly and draining.Two of the members are no longer in Congress, and my efforts now are in garnishing their wages from private employers, but every move I make is met by moves from them. On we go.I doubt that I will ever be repaid the monies lost or punitive damages, and the one offer I was made involved campaign funds, which is not only illegal, but the very thing Hillary Clinton was accused of doing with ME. The irony is thick.My primary objective now is that what was done to me be included in various investigations proving the illegality and corruption of the GOP and the Trump campaign, in which I was a small, incensed footnote.The Democrats now have the House, but only since January. They are being helpful, but nothing moves quickly in D.C. or when Republicans are involved. I return one last time on April 23rd to meet the remaining GOP member to see what sort of settlement is offered. If the provenance of the money is pure and if there is no restraint on what I can say or write, I'll take it. If my demands are not met, I will turn the story over to the reporter who has been following me on this for over a year. Want more info? Reach out to me."

Until an investigation is undertaken, we cannot know who did this or why. No matter the result, this is not how Americans resolve their differences. We talk, we argue, sometimes we march, and most of all we vote. We do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs.So, let's all pitch in , no matter what your party affiliation, in and get that office open again quickly.More InfoHere's some additional information that GoFundMe likes to see expressed:My name is David Weinberger.  (There's more about me here and here.) My name is on this campaign, but it's actually the work of several people:Dan GillmorJeff JarvisClay ShirkyJoe TrippiZeynep TufekciAll of us are long-time Internet students and do-ers.  We're also all either Democrats, or independents who are leaning that way in this cycle.We put this campaign together quickly after talking about an idea that Zeynep tweeted .  The idea evolved to the point where a GFM campaign made sense. I initiated it. Our aim is, as stated, to help fund the re-opening of the bombed-out office. We do not want any of the funds gathered to be used for other political activities. We are currently talking with officials of Orange County and hope soon to be talking with the local GOP leaders to figure out how to provide this funding in a way that meets the election laws (which are complex) and that accomplishes the campaign's stated goal of re-opening the office. If there's no legal, practical way to put all of the money to that use, we will find a strictly non-partisan way of using it, and will let the donors know  so that they can participate in the decision.Thanks for your support in standing up for democracy, even when we disagree (sometimes quite fundamenally) with the policies of some of the participants."

He was last heard from on July 27th at 2 in the morning, and has been missing ever since. Search teams and helicopters organized by local law enforcement agencies have been searching for him after a missing person's report was filed, and continue to do so.We are attempting to raise money for Riley's family in order to aid with the ongoing search. This can help aid his parents in covering travel costs, food, supplies, lodging, and whatever other costs occur. This is a very trying time, and any donations will assist in the ongoing efforts to locate Riley tremendously. Receiving funds in a timely manner will be of the greatest benefit, but each and every cent counts, no matter the timing. There is no goal in regards to a certain amount of funds we are trying to reach. We just want to do what we can to help, and all funds will go directly to the family.This fund has been created by friends of the Zickel family. Riley grew up as an extension of our family while spending many childhood years attending our mothers Preschool and Daycare, as well as growing up alongside myself and my two siblings.This trying time requires immense love, prayer, and support for Riley and his family. The outreach has already been amazing, and we need to continue this energy and compassion as the search continues. We can help do more on our part by aiding the Zickel family while we continue sending our positive thougts.We truly thank you for all of your kindness, support, and willingness to contribute to this fund for the Zickel family.Here is an article from the Santa Rosa Press Democrat with more details.http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/5922134-181/missing-analy-grad-riley-zickel?artslide=3"

When my oncologist told us that our best hope is flying to Switzerland for treatment, we decided to say yes without knowing how we would pull it off. It almost reminds me of the “trust fall,” where you fall backwards and believe that someone will be back there to catch you. In this case, our family, friends and a lot of people who we don’t even know not only caught us, but lifted us up more than we can believe. The amount of funds raised in a matter of hours and days was stunning. I never would have believed that we’d have this kind of response, especially after many of you have already given to us in the past. It seems like every day on every television channel and every internet story, we are told how divided we are in this country for a variety of reasons. To me - this has been the ultimate reminder that people really are good. A large community that is united by compassion and kindness has lifted us up when we needed it the most. A community, by the way, made up of people in many states, several countries, men and women, straight and gay, Republicans and Democrats, young and old, etc. It will be impossible for us to ever thank this community of kindness in a way that feels like enough. But from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate what each one of you has done for us. Whether it was a donation, sending us a dinner, saying a prayer, giving a hug on a tough day, or just being a friend, this community has meant everything to us - and I thank you. We will do our very best to pay your kindness forward in as many ways as we can in the future.So here we are - in Switzerland. I will be admitted into the hospital tomorrow morning, and will stay until Thursday. I want this treatment to be successful for the obvious reasons, but I also feel some strange pressure to make all of your support worth it. I know that’s a little crazy, but I don’t want to let everyone down. Once I’m injected with the isotope, I will literally be radioactive. Nobody (including Anne) will be able to be around me for a day and a half. People experience a wide range of side effects, so I’m not sure what to expect. I’m both excited about the treatment and also already nervous about the future results. We will keep you posted on how it goes. Thanks again and I love you all!-ScottUPDATE:**Thanks to your generosity, we were able to meet our initial goal in less than a day!! Since the interest in helping has been so high, we will continue and any additional funds will go towards Scott’s second and third treatments that will come to a total of $36,000.  We are overwhelmed by the response and I know that Scott and Anne are as well. **Our brother Scott continues his courageous battle with cancer.  With his wife Anne and son Alec by his side, he has fought every day.  His best option for treatment at this point takes them to Switzerland.  We are hoping to raise enough to help him pay for his first treatment and anything additional will go toward subsequent treatments (he has to go 3 times).   We want them to be able to focus on getting the best treatment he can and enjoying every day without worrying about medical and traveling costs.  When we approached Scott about additional fundraising, he finally agreed but only if we would add a personal letter to you all.  We have attached the letter below.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  As a family, we appreciate all your support.Renee & MichelleHi Friends and Family,First, we want to thank all of you who have offered to set up a fundraising site for us. We have agreed to let my sisters create one, but felt like we needed to tell everyone why. Since my diagnosis, we have gotten so much support.  People have set up fundraisers for us over the last few years.  There were times when we thought we had been given way too much and would eventually need to donate it to a non-profit.   However, this journey turned out to be more challenging (and more expensive) than we realized.    Our eyes are now wide-open to healthcare in America, and people with rare diseases are really in a tough spot. Luckily, we have you.  Trust me, without you all I might not be here today.  And if I were, we certainly would not still be living in our house or be able to send Alec to daycare.   We cannot thank everyone enough for all of the prayers and support.  We absolutely could not do it without you.   Up until now I have been able to see the best specialists in the country at MD Anderson in Texas and James Cancer Center in Ohio.  I have tried several clinical trials, but the cancer has continued to act very aggressively.   All of the specialists agree that my best chance now is a full body radiation procedure called PRRT.   It is an amazing treatment that can target all of the bone tumors in my body (I have many, many of them now).  It has been approved by the FDA for the more common types of neuroendocrine cancers, but not for mine.  Since insurance does not cover anything not approved by the FDA – we’re out of luck.  Believe it or not, it is less expensive to go to another country and pay out of pocket for the procedure than it is to get it here at the hospital in Pittsburgh without help from insurance.   We have made the decision to go to Basel, Switzerland to get the first round of PRRT.  The first treatment alone will be $12,000 (there are 3 treatments overall, 10 weeks apart), and there will obviously be significant travel expenses.  The cost is high, and it was not an easy decision for me, but I feel like no matter what happens, Alec has to know that I did everything that I possibly could to spend more time with him.  And besides, I haven’t given up yet. And I don’t plan on it.   We want you to know that you have already done your part.   Nobody should feel like they need to contribute again.  We love you all so much for everything that you have already done and nothing will change that.   We agreed to this because many are asking what else they can do, and honestly – we need some help.  Not counting the trip(s) overseas, the costs of endless appointments, prescriptions and travel add up quickly.  It has been very humbling to go from a life where we never had to worry about finances, to a place where we have to admit that we can’t do it on our own.  We can only say that your thoughts, prayers, kindness and support have meant everything to us and we’ll do everything that we can to pay it forward when we are able. Love,Scott, Anne & Alec"

The election will take place at the end of June and the person selected by the National Committee of YDA will serve a two year term. My Platform is as follows: 1.  Shake up the Democratic Party: we are the movement Our party needs to shake up how our candidates campaign. We can not continue to do things as they have always been done. We need to be investing in cutting edge technology and taking chances by thinking and working outside the box. This includes messaging, not just what we say but how we say it and how volunteers and voters relate to it. This change must start at the local level, not from the top down. With our local chapters we can talk to voters, listen and learn from them and instill in them that the Democratic Party is still the party for the people. We cannot sit around and wait for these changes to happen. 2.  Inspire passion and elect passionate candidates We must work within the party to identify community leaders and party leaders who are passionate about the party and are inspiring to others. We need leaders and representatives to be a messenger for the party. More importantly we need people to want to listen. I hope to help reignite the party and work with passionate people from every level of the party. 3.  Establish ourselves (Young Democrats) as a driving force in the 2018-2020 elections Young Democrats are the movement. We bring the change to the table well before it is adopted. We need to continue to push the envelope and work within our capacity to deliver electoral results. We are not just work horses for the party and candidates, we are equal stakeholders. We have a choice in 2018 to continue the status quo or forge a new path ourselves. Grassroots campaigning is crucial and it’s where YDA excels We need to continue to strive at what we do best, getting out the youth vote. We all know that when we communicate with an intersectional message not only does it inspire young people to vote, it also croses generations. We must continue to lead by example. 4.  Connect DNC to state chapters Each state and each state chapter is unique. There is not a one sized fits all method that works. We need the DNC to work with our state chapters to develop and implement strategies for success."

For the third year we’ve created a limited-edition wooden egg  to raise money for the vital programs that fight against the current administration’s systematic efforts to silence our voices.   When you donate $18 to this campaign, I will send a wooden egg to thank you for your support.  These are the same wooden eggs manufactured for the White House, and all of the funds, after subtracting the cost of the eggs and shipping, will be donated to support two organizations, NPR and PBS.  Last year, we donated over $10,500 to these organizations. You can donate any amount, but here are suggested donation amounts:      $18 = one egg      $35 = two eggs      $50 = three eggs      $62 = four eggs      $75 = five eggs IMPORTANT NOTE:  To protect your privacy, GoFundMe no longer collects addresses.  After your donation, you will need to email your address (click on the envelope next to my name) so I can ship the eggs.  I will not save or use any of your contact information for any purpose other than to mail the eggs.  I cannot honor specific color requests, but I will do my best.This  is the third year, and, arguably, the prettiest egg design, to add my small voice to those of much more brave men and women who are speaking truth to power. This 2019 campaign will raise funds to support the storytellers--PBS and NPR--the vital journalists on the front lines, sharing the voices of those who cannot speak for themselves. These two organizations are devoted to revealing the truth of our shared humanity.  Our president frequently attempts to discredit these voices--we need to support our freedom to speak, to question, and to demand answers. Last year, I was able to donate $10,500 to PBS and NPR. In two years, over, 800 donors agreed that we can’t sit on the sidelines: we need to act to preserve the dream--the reality--of a functioning democracy.  It's been an amazing journey to raise $23,000 over two years and to meet people all over the country who want to make a difference.Both National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System are charged with the responsibility being the people’s voice. It’s fitting — imperative — that we create a different choice that reflects the values we want for our children, and that we want our country to stand for. This egg is a different choice. It’s called an ""Easter” egg, but the egg is a broader symbol of the potential for our children to enjoy a brighter future where every voice is heard — where  children of every race, color, religion, nationality, and gender can joyfully roll eggs and celebrate the beauty of spring and the cherished principles of freedom, justice, and inclusiveness that make our country great (already). A personal note:  From the time that my children were small, until they outgrew the hunt, I brought my children to the White House to participate in the annual White House Easter egg roll and/or purchased the souvenir eggs. Now that my children are grown, I still love the hunt and want to find a productive and positive way to participate. I have Bush, Clinton, and Obama era eggs in my collection… no matter the administration in power, I always supported this annual event. And I want it to continue. Republican or Democrat, I loved the tradition and trust that the people elected a President who had my children’s future in consideration when he made executive decisions. This president has broken that trust with his anti-family, anti-children, anti-truth, anti-environment platform.  I may be one person, but I hope that this campaign will help to deliver my message. Some background: The first campaign began in 2017 in response to an article in The Washington Post that questioned if the White House would hold an Easter Egg Roll. How big a deal is the White House Easter Egg Roll? It’s been going on since 1898 , when local children convinced President Rutherford B. Hayes to let them roll eggs on the White House lawn, after Congress kicked them off the Capitol grounds. If you would like to know more about the origin of this idea, please read some of articles about the Alt Easter Egg:""With alternative to White House Easter egg, teacher raises thousands for PBS, NPR"" (The Frederick News Post) “How Trump turned a White House Easter Egg Roll devotee into a political activist” (The Washington Post) “Woman opposed to Trump policies creates Easter egg roll alternative” (The Carroll County Times) “White House Easter Egg Roll devotee says ‘not this year’”  (The Charlotte Observer) “The Maine Company that makes wooden Easter eggs for the White House”(Bangor Daily News) “Let the alt-eggs roll:  Frederick County teacher creates wooden egg to benefit arts programs” (Frederick News Post)"

This development would be inappropriate and would harm the openness of the Calderstones/Woolton Green Wedge.b.       The application site is part of Calderstones Park and that the (Planning) Officer’s Report misled the Planning Committee.Justice Kerr, at the High Court, found in favour of the Calderstone’s/LOGS Campaign and upheld their JR on both grounds. In relation to the Green Wedge, the Judge stated that ‘Planning Policy is a matter if law’ and that “Planning authorities do not live in the world of Humpty Dumpty and cannot make policies mean what they want them to mean” (P18 of Judgement) i.e. LCC cannot play fast and loose with the contents of the Local Plan – interpreting them in any way they choose. Notice also, that the Planning Officer (under whose direction?) was found to have been deliberately misleading the Planning Committee and, by extension, the people of Liverpool. ALLERTON PRIORY LAND FALLS WITHIN THE SAME GREEN WEDGE AND, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAND IS PRIVATE OR NOT, THE SAME LAW SHOULD HOLD TRUE. It is no surprise that Liverpool City Council have immediately appealed Justice Kerr’s decision on the Green Wedge policy because they (and their Executive Housing PARTNER Redrow) wish to continue building upon Liverpool’s Green Spaces. The fact that LCC (and Redrow) have appealed the Green Wedge decision gives all those who support the Allerton Priory Campaign cause for grave concern; after all, the Council spent over £100,000 “supposedly” fighting Redrow’s scheme to build on AP land – and one of the main grounds of its defense was to uphold the Green Wedge designation (OE3). The Council has now exposed itself in a huge duplicity.It appears that anyone in Liverpool, who expressed an opinion, was against the AP scheme. Logic would dictate that they are still of the same opinion and still all want to stop this development. The following issues I am about to outline would therefore suggest that the City of Liverpool and its Council (and indeed the Planning Inspectorate), with a view to truth and justice, would therefore wish to investigate and quash the Appeal decision based on the numerous irregularities and unorthodox events that have recently come to light. We understand that you are extremely busy and, for brevity, I have summarised these issues in bullet points (but each one can be vastly expanded upon if required and evidence can be produced) : 1.       In all of the official planning documentation prior to both the original Planning Application and then the subsequent Public Inquiry, the Council had been declaring that it had the requisite 5 Year Housing Supply yet incredibly failed to substantiate this fact at the Public Inquiry.2.       The Inspector gave LCC & Redrow an additional day to meet and come to an agreement on the 5 Year Housing Supply figures outside of the scrutiny of both the Public Inquiry and the public itself. An important point here is that LCC and Redrow are official “PARTNERS” for Executive Housing. So two partners, who presumably had a joint goal, have been allowed to collude on the figures presented to the Inspector without an independent party witnessing and validating the facts.3.       According to a Statement by Mirna Juarez (Liberal Democrat Councilor for Allerton& Hunts Cross Ward) at the Allerton Priory Reserved Matters meeting on 30 October 2018 there would appear to be a discrepancy between the housing supply figures presented to the Secretary of State for the new Local Plan and those provided at the Allerton Priory Public Inquiry weeks earlier.4.       There would appear to be a conflict of interest between the legal teams the Council chose to represent the Allerton Priory and Calderstones cases.5.       Why did the Council and its legal team not seek a Judicial Review following the Inspector’s decision to find in Redrow’s favour at the Public Inquiry? A Judge decided that the Calderstones team had a sufficiently strong case on the grounds of the Green Wedge designation – so why did LCC not investigate this legal avenue;  We are led to understand that to take a Judge’s advice on this matter is free of charge.6.       A letter has been sent to the Chief Constable of Merseyside asking for a full investigation into the disclosure by a Senior Labour Councilor  that Liverpool City Council were content to refuse Redrow’s application to build on Allerton Priory because they knew they would “throw it” at the Public Inquiry (which would and did inevitably ensue). There are witnesses to this disclosure.The fact that a very Senior Labour Councilor made this statement is extremely important. Liverpool City Council spent over £100,000 defending its decision to “refuse” permission for the Allerton Priory scheme. The scheme itself could possibly be worth something in the region of £50-100 million to certain parties.  If what the Councilor disclosed is true, then it would appear that fraud or malfeasance has likely taken place within public office by one or more public officials in relation to this planning application. Indeed, it would seem that one or more of the following 3 Sections of the Fraud Act 2006 would apply to one or more councilors or officials.7.       It seems to the Allerton Priory campaign that Redrow misled the Inquiry by stating up to 160 houses would be built when they must have known all along they could only build 100.  Was this a deliberate inflation of figures to convince the Inspector that they would be assisting LCC to meet its 5 Year Housing Supply?8.       In May 1989 the Secretary of State’s decision was to DISMISS THE APPEAL of the Regional Health Authority against the Council’s refusal of permission for residential development on the grounds of Woolton Manor (in the same Green Wedge as Allerton Priory), stating it ‘is a clear vindication of the Council’s Green Wedge policy in this part of the city’. This is also private land, just as Allerton Priory is privately owned land and is of ‘strategic significance in the southern part of the city which is considered worthy of protection.’ We believe that the Inspector has therefore failed to take into account previous decisions made by the Secretary of State on the Woolton-Calderstones Green Wedge.9.       The Mapping firm Esri UK analysed Landsat 8 satellite images from spring 2016 for the 10 cities with the largest populations. Liverpool was ranked rock bottom with 16% green space. We feel that Government and Local Authority representatives should acknowledge this disparity and seek to ameliorate this rather than allow it to be exacerbated by this terrible error of judgement on behalf of the Inspector.10.    There was no Public Consultation in any meaningful sense of the term. This is a legal planning requirement. Consultation was specifically restricted to LCC Councilors only. A late request was made by Maria Eagle MP to meet with Redrow on Allerton Priory land, but they insisted that they would only meet with one representative from SAP which we believed to be totally undemocratic."

$11,977 raised of $100,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/savethetappanzee,"Port Chester, NY",Save OUR Tappan Zee,"Created November 28, 2017","Greetings from the Executive Director of Save Our Tappan Zee, Inc., a legal NY not-for-profit corporation.My name is Dr. Monroe Mann, PhD, Esq, MBA.  I'm a resident of Westchester County, New York, and (to avoid confusion) son of the late Port Chester attorney of the same name. You can google my name to learn more about me.  For those who don't know, I'm the guy who started the petition to return the traditional Indian/Dutch Tappan Zee name to our new bridge. Rationale: History Matters.Well, the cause is growing.  But Albany doesn't appear to be listening as clearly as we had hoped: Albany is still trying to belittle our effort as a right-wing political charade that has little bipartisan support.  The truth--as we all know--is that the Tappan Zee name means a lot to all New Yorkers: Republican, Democrat, Independent, and apolitical citizens as well.  The arguments that Albany & its supporters make in defense do not stand up:1. ""New Bridge, New Name"".  Negative.  London Bridge in England was destroyed four times, and four times, it was rebuilt, and yet the traditional historical name always remained.  A new name is not acceptable simply because the bridge was rebuilt.  Here, history matters.2. ""There is a long tradition of renaming public structures after politicians"".  Well, the tradition is wrong, corrupt, and a waste of tax-payer money.  With all due respect, the history of the Tappan Indians and the Dutch is far longer (and more important) than this terrible tradition of renaming public structures after politicians.3. ""Mario Cuomo had a profoundly positive effect on New York State.""  That very well may be true, but as an apolitical organization, we won't be getting into that issue.   And that's precisely the point: it doesn't matter how much of an impact he had on our state, his name does not deserve to push aside the ever greater & historical Tappan Zee name.  In fact, after I read a recent biography of Mario Cuomo, I have to say, I have a lot of respect for him. I honestly think he would support our side of this controversy.  It is for these reasons that the board of directors and I have started this fundraising drive: to take our cause to the next level in the form of a not-for-profit.  Your financial support will allow us to better organize and execute this fight. SOLE APOLITICAL HISTORICAL PURPOSE: 
Save Our Tappan Zee, Inc. has three missions, as on file with the NY Secretary of State:1. PRIMARY PURPOSE: To preserve through any lawful means any history related to the Tappan Zee name, and what it represents to the citizens of the state of New York, to include landmarks, infrastructure, historical references, schools, buildings, etc. 2. SECONDARY PURPOSE: To raise money for (and eventually operate) a Tappan Zee/Tappan Zee Bridge museum that chronicles the history of the Tappan Indians and the Dutch in New York. 3. TERTIARY PURPOSE: If successful (and only if successful) in returning the historic Tappan Zee name to the bridge that rightfully deserves it, to assist other organizations fighting similar battles for apolitical historic reasons to preserve NY and/or American history, or to directly engage in such apolitical preservation efforts.WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO: * To raise money to pay for signs, bumper stickers, t-shirts, and more that say ""Save Our Tappan Zee"" to be placed in every city and town in New York State* One of the advertisements will be a billboard in Albany(if possible), and also along the highways leading up to and near the Tappan Zee Bridge (if possible).* To raise money to pay for part-time ""county team leaders"" and ""city team leaders"" to organize events and volunteers in various counties and cities, sharing the history of the Tappan Indians and the Dutch, the circumstances before us, and the importance of our cause with as many people as we can reach. * To hire a part-time publicist to continually get the word out* To put Executive Director Monroe Mann on a modest part-time executive director salary so that he can focus as much time and energy as is required to lead this effort.* To legally form the company ($1000 to start the not-for-profit consisting of about $250 corporation fees, $750 IRS application fees, etc.--I will donate my legal services & acumen for free to the cause)* And yes, to eventually start the creation of the museum, to share the Tappan Indian, Dutch, and Tappan Zee Bridge history with all.   Our ultimate goal is to raise $100,000--and that is totally possible. If just 4,000 of the petition signers contribute $25, we'll reach our goal.   Or if  20,000 contribute $5 each.  NOTE: while we have applied for and should be eligible for federal tax exemption, I cannot make a guarantee that we will receive tax-exempt status.  As such, please be aware that any donation would only be tax deductible if the IRS does indeed grant us tax-exempt status, a process that itself could take up to six months.
Thank you for your support!

We are fed up and we are going to help do what President Trump pledged to do....Build The Wall!  CNN recently reported that it would cost each American Citizen between $120-150 per Citizen to build the wall. There has been push back from Mexico and Democrats who say that we will never build the wall...Well, Patriots shall prove them wrong. Just like they said Donald J. Trump would never be President, the American people proved them wrong and he is our President. Now, it's time to start funding the project to Build The Wall, and, together, united, we can protect America's citizens and borders. Let's show the world what faithful, patriotic, American Citizens, and our allies, can do, when the naysayers say we can't!  When this campaign to raise funds to Build The Wall is completed, and as much money as possible can be raised during the campaign,  the funds, less delivery costs and steel slats, security equipment, land or easements purchases, etc., and a small 2% fee for fund management, accounting and legal expenses, and some funds will be paid to the Homeland Security Defense Coalition workers who have spent over 2 years working 8 or more hours every day, promoting this campaign, on behalf of American Citizens who donate to help finish construction of as much of the Great American Wall as possible, to protect the borders of America. We voted for  Trump and We Voted For The Wall to be built! We are legal American Citizens and the charity is run by a retired federal agent, and with the help of other American Patriot citizens, we can provide these funds, willingly, and properly to the private Border landowners, and as allowed, non-profit or government contracted organizations that will be in charge of obtaining & delivery of parts of the privately funded portions of the security and border wall materials and labor.  President Trump is our President and the funds raised in this campaign are from the heart of all great patriotic Americans and will be used to protect the heart of America. When the campaign is completed, and we reach our goal, the funds will be donated to Homeland Security Defense Coalition, a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization, which  will be soliciting bids & procurement and purchase of steel slats & other construction or security equipment materials & equipment, donating it to the private Border landowners to build walls on private border land, and as allowed, any government contracted wall builders, and as allowed, to border sheriff's and border patrol, and directly supervising the use of donated materials & equipment installation, building of the steel slats barrier & wall, but we need to raise a significant amount to do it. Our goals for border security and wall will include a physical wall, electronic monitoring of ground disturbances (tunneling or digging under the wall) and electronic surveillance of the top and quality of the girth of the wall being disturbed in any way. This is accomplished through motion sensors and CCV to be remotely monitored by the U.S. Border Patrol via a monitoring station. There is much to do! Let's do this! We can do it! "

Crooked judges and law enforcement officials were involved in  several of the cases uncovered by the AP.In 2012, the Geechee people of Sapelo Island, GA had to fight off a McIntosh County tax reassessment that resulted in more than 500% tax increases  for almost all of the Hog Hammock community's less than 50 families. Incredibly, Annie Watts, 73, saw the tax bill for her three-room, 1-acre Sapelo Island homestead rise from just $362 to $2,312, according to The New York Times.Currently, we're working with Hilton Head Island's  Native Islander Gullah Community; the S.C. Chapter of the National Action Network; and the new HHI Chapter of NAN to get land use restrictions loosened that keep Gullah Geechees from subdividing their land among relatives, and using it for economic development. The graphic video below--which is narrated by Gullah businessman Taiwan Scott--shows how Town of Hilton Head Island officials have been neglecting the needs of Native Islander Gullah taxpayers since the town was incorporated in 1983.And here's some of the media coverage about PAFEN's work with Hilton Head Island's Native Islander Gullah Community:http://www.wtoc.com/story/31650117/groups-say-hhi-regulations-preventing-indigeno http://www.islandpacket.com/news/local/article136580843.html RENTERS FACE DISPLACEMENT, TOOGullah-Geechee renters are also facing displacement, and the difficult search for new affordable housing in record numbers due to gentrification in cities including Savannah, GA , and Charleston, SC. In Charleston, according to a Dec. 23, 2014 article in the Black-owned newspaper, The Charleston Chronicle, the city's Black popuation was plummeted from 70% to just 28% since 1980!THE PAN-AFRICAN FAMILY EMPOWERMENT NETWORK'S  MISSIONOne of the PAFEN's main goals is empowering people of African descent with the educational, organizational, and financial tools necessary to protect their ancestral homes, family-owned land, and farms from being lost through delinquent tax sales; gentrification;  new developments and resorts; and skyrocketing property taxes.We also aim to ensure that African peoples understand that land and home ownership are key to building wealth to pass from one generation to the next, as well as important stepping stones to breaking the cycle of generational poverty.THE GULLAH-GEECHEE CULTURAL HERITAGE CORRIDORThe Gullah-Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor was established by Congress in 2006 through the tireless efforts of Gullah-Geechee leaders like Marquetta ""Queen Quet"" Goodwine of St. Helena Island, SC. Powerful back-up and legislative leadership  was provided by U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, the first African-American elected to Congress from South Carolina since Reconstruction. He's  currently the third highest ranking Democrat  in the U.S. House.  The Gullah-Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor is marked by distinctive roadsigns from Wilmington, NC to Jacksonville, FL. It  seeks to preserve and protect the culturally-unique Gullah-Geechee people, whose blended West African, Native-American, and European culture features some of the purest traditional African cultural retentions in the New World.""Unless something is done to halt the destruction, Gullah Geechee culture will be relegated to museums and history books, and our nation's unique cultural mosaic will lose one of its richest and most colorful pieces,"" observes the National Trust for Historic Preservation website. Because many of their families live on valuable waterfront property on  beautiful sea islands stretching from North Carolina to Florida, untold numbers of Gullah-Geechee people are being forced to sell land their families have owned for generations due to skyrocketing taxes.LANDOWNERS  NEED TRANSITIONAL FUNDSFortunately, here in Beaufort County, SC the Beaufort County Council has made it possible for all taxpayers to pay their property taxes in six equal installments--rather than one often hard to obtain lump sum payment. The problem is that taxpayers have to be current on their tax bills by Jan. 15--in order to start making the estimated installment payments on the next year's taxes by February 15. Gullah-Geechee families have tried to raise funds to pay their taxes by many methods, including fish frys; bake sales; raffles; yard sales; timber harvesting; payday and finance company loans; and the online  sale of products like the Sapelo Island Geechee Red Peas Project. But they still need help from other sources.$500,000 GOAL IS JUST THE BEGINNINGOur long-term goal is to raise $5-million to assist Gullah-Geechee families with  buying back property that was sold at  delinquent tax sales before the ""one year and a day"" redemption deadline; providing training on various aspects of lowering  property taxes and making property pay for itself; and giving one-time tax payment grants to allow families to make the transition to installment tax payments. Any donation that you can make will be greatly appreciated, and publicly acknowledged on  the Pan-African Family Empowerment Network website--unless you request to remain anonymous.  Please give as generously as possible. No donation is too small, or too large:)We're a 501c3 tax-exempt organization, and will issue  receipts that can be used for tax-deductions.Thanks in advance for your much-needed support!Theresa White, Founder & CEOThe Pan-African Family Empowerment & Land Preservation Network, Inc.St. Helena Island, SC"

$25,400 raised of $35,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/sue-hessel-pinky-pie,"Yantis, TX",Sue Hessel (Pinky Pie),"Created November 15, 2016","Sue Hessel—personal historian, gifted writer, humanitarian, wife, mom, granny, and friend to all (especially Democrats)—has spent her life giving freely to others through her myriad roles. Now it's our privilege and your opportunity to give back. At the request of Sue's colleagues and friends connected over the past decade and more through the Association of Personal Historians (APH), I am opening this fund drive to help her contend with the enormous medical expenses incurred due to her recurrence of breast cancer. Below is Sue's story told in her own inimitablestyle and excerpted from her ""Pinky Pie"" blog at https://shessel.wordpress.com/The password I set for my blog in 2009 {after the first breast cancer diagnosis} involved the F word and cancer. As I’ve emailed and talked to people {following the recent recurrence}, I noticed there was use of a variety of swear words. I myself kept saying shit to my doctor and apologizing. I’m guessing that many if not all of us were raised by parents who frowned on such words, but shit, damn and hell, there are times to use them. I believe this is it. . . .  I do believe we need to be kind to each other—but not to cancer.Alas, there is cancer. I can be glib; I can be funny; I can be terrified. On any given day, it’s a mixture of all three. Going into my oncology appointment yesterday, I was terrified of hearing her tell me, “There is nothing that can be done. Go home and get your affairs in order.” What she said was the CT scan showed a couple of small spots in my liver . . . And the pathology report indicated it is the original breast cancer in my lung and bones, which is better than having a new lung cancer. We may be able to treat those nasty cancer cells with a couple of oral medications for a time {depending on the receptor activity}. If the receptors don’t match whatever needs to be matched, I will be started on some big gun chemotherapy. . . . I will also have monthly IV treatments to strengthen my bones.Sue next had to have an MRI of her brain to ensure the cancer cells had not spread there. Luckily, they have not. They have identified, however, a tumor on her spinal cord that could cause paralisis if not treated and that required emergency radiation treatment. That's when she discovered that her insurance will not cover radiation or chemotherapy. Luckily, the Mayo Clinic Charity Care agreed to help pay for the radiation therapy, but just enough to get the treatments started.  The Mayo Special Pharmacy has arranged to discount  her various medications, including the $10,500-per-cycle drug required to treat the cancer. Even with their help, Sue and her family obviously are overwhelmed financially at this point.  In another year, Sue will be eligible for Medicare, but that doesn't solve her current predictament at all. So we're asking you to open your hearts and your wallets to help Sue through an incredibly difficult time. Those of you who know her realize how extraordinary a lady she is, always ready with a smile and joke to make the best of any given situation or to simply brighten our spirirts. As soon as she learned about her own recurrence, she became obsessed with reaching out to other friends (including me) who had experienced breast cancer after her first bout with it. Not wanting them to be any more frightened than they already were, she reassured each of them that her experience did not have to be theirs. Those of you who don't know Sue are missing something special but can remedy that a bit by reading her uplifting, often hilarious blog (even while dealing with such serious subject matter). Once we've met our goal, I'd love to invite you to a very special cyber ""Pinky Pie"" celebration. Please be generous with your donations!  ***The photo  is of Sue Hessel at an APH Conference in Nashville in 2007 (pre breast cancer days) demonstrating ""Breast Reconstruction Surgery, Wisconsin Style.""

Please consider a contribution to assist with education expenses for the children. Flynn was one of the original merry band of warriors and generals recruited and empowered by the late Andrew Breitbart back in 2009.  Flynn was the man who spear-headed Breitbart’s roll-out of the Acorn video series when Big Government first launched in 2009. As Breitbart’s sole employee in Washington DC in those early days, Flynn was the pivot person for every story and strategy focused on the federal government and national politics.To his friends, Flynn was fiercely loyal, quick witted, intelligent and relentless in his defense of America’s founding ideals and the notion that individuals should have the right to live their lives without intrusion of the federal government. To his political adversaries he was tenacious and formidable yet quick with a joke at the end of a long, hard-fought battle.Flynn’s laugh was infectious and boisterous and his ability to find a political ally in almost every district in the country when a story popped up was legendary. There were many times when a tip would come in to the Breitbart editorial team and Flynn would jump on to a conference call to dazzle all of us with his knowledge of exactly what the local, state and national ramifications would be on how the potential story would play out. He almost always “knew a guy” who could get a grass-roots video to turn a story into a blockbuster.His efforts with Big Government were instrumental in many seats flipping from Democrat to Republican in 2010 and he was a frequent guest on talk radio and cable news on behalf of the Breitbart media empire.Mike Flynn was a warrior who measured his effectiveness not just with the political scalps he obtained through exposing corruption at the highest levels of government but with the friends and allies he racked up through his tenacious efforts for a common cause. He loved this country and could speak eloquently and at length on the courage, foresight and brilliance of the founding fathers, but also of the unnamed patriots who did the actual fighting in the trenches during our nation’s founding.During political debates Flynn would also say something like “I’m pretty sure those boys at Valley Forge didn’t freeze their toes off fighting for our independence just so this congressman can get a boondoggle project paid for on the tax-payer’s dime.” It was that kind of passion and wit that made Flynn one of a kind and he will be sorely missed.While Mike had a successful career in politics, the most important thing to Mike was his wife, four children, parents and siblings. Rest in peace, American patriot and happy warrior Michael Flynn."

We are preparing to wrap up that journey, focusing on the growth of the movement over the last six months.The official schedule for the second half of filming is now live and we are excited to visit the states that we missed while also revisiting activists and organizers who we spoke to last year.We are going to show its growth and show how the movement inspired by the Bernie Sanders is keeping its momentum and what you can do to help.Not only do we speak to organizers inside the democratic party, we are speaking to members of all parties and independents, alike. Tackling issues such as Election Integrity, civics in our schools, and how these and other ideas are affecting our every day lives.We're hitting the road in the first week of may.First, there will be filming in LA and then a small trip to San Diego, lots of very exciting things happening in regards to holding violators during the primary accountable... and a brief trip in Santa Ana.From there it is...Las Vegas, NVPhoenix, AZTucson, AZEl Paso, TXAlbuquerque, NMDenver, COSalt Lake City, UTReno, NVLanding in Sacramento, CA for the Democratic California Convention from May 18th to May 22nd3 weeks to visit 11 major cities...From there it is...

After the Convention, the movement fractured into splinter groups with neither Sanders nor the DNC able to reign in the progressive voters. With a vicious primary, but a picturesque Convention, everything should be fine... Traveling the country, Don Ford interviewed organizers, delegates, elected officials, and party leaders to get a clearer idea of what really happened in the primary season and during the convention. While following various issues important to the progressive movement, the project is shedding light on the issues these activists and politicians are facing as they attempt to help move the country forward and improve the quality of life for the average American. After 150 interviews across 35 states, Don settled in finally home on Nov 8th after 4 months on the road. To watch Donald Trump overwhelmingly be elected the 45th President of the United States.So, what happened? How did everyone get it so wrong?And, What's Next?The goal was to capture the progressive perspective without filter and offer them the opportunity to share what they've accomplished, how they accomplished it, what will maintain the momentum, and What's Next?But, now we're headed back on the road to talk to the progressives organizing the resist movement felt nationwide. The movement has grown from a fledgling uprising campaign to a national attitude toward corruption in our elected officials.Can progressives unite under one banner again? Are Trump's supporter disillusioned by his inability to hold his lofty campaign promises? Can progressives bring them to their cause to make a larger majority?

We've come to the realization that we are in a rare space of history where no one is really sure what is going to happen. Independents and Progressive Democrats are equal parts inspired and confused, but the general consensus is that we have to keep the momentum and find a way to keep people inspired.

As a rule, GFM only shows the total amount of money 'raised' -- not the current balance in the account. This campaign for 'O' started over a year ago, and is the sole source of funding for the trip. Because of her health, we've had to drive across the country to see specialists. She still has two more hospitals to reach yet, as she desperately seeks her diagnosis. We hope and pray to continue this trip, and we gratefully thank you for visiting her GoFundMe page. With our best wishes,Helen (mom) and OliviaO's story:Please help my 25 year-old daughter Olivia Weber reach the Mayo Clinic, the National Institute of Health's ""Undiagnosed Diseases Program"", Johns Hopkins Hospital and Yale School of Medicine. Her trip begins in Fall/2015 and will continue through early Summer/2016. Olivia is critically ill with a baffling, rare disease that is extremely life-threatening and so far undiagnosed. Because she is in extreme pain, Olivia generally lays down most of the time now in order to be comfortable - because of this, we are in need of a better vehicle for the trip, one that has room for a small bed as well as for her medical supplies (update: this fund has generously provided a terrific, used SUV). A diagnosis is desperately needed so that her illness can be treated as soon as possible.  Because O has an aneurism in a major artery near her heart, we can only drive across country from California in order to meet with specialists at each hospital; flying there is not an option at this time because of multiple blood clots in her lungs, plus the aneurism, all of which are susceptible to rupture from both air and altitude pressure.We must also take the southernmost route, which has very little change in elevation. Help from this site would fund a used-vehicle purchase for the trip, and it would also fund expenses like lodging, gas and food, as well as assist with her many extraordinary medical expenses.*Please help - we are desperately trying to save Olivia's life.*High school graduation photoAfter a lifetime of playing competitive soccer and running track, Olivia is instead critically ill.  We simply never saw this coming and it has changed our lives.  We desperately seek the help of specific research hospitals across the country, because that happens to be where the specialists are located who are needed for her unusual case.  With something so rare involved, we must find those working on the cutting edge of medicine.*Number 22.Recently discovered through MRI and CT studies were the deadly aneurism in her pulmonary artery, and multiple blood clots in both lungs. She also has internal bleeding, known as 'vasculitis'. We think this causes the horrible pain she endures, and it possibly also caused the blood clots and the aneurism. *After chemo with pal Momo - January 2015This entire situation is extremely dangerous because at any time, the aneurism can rupture and end Olivia's life instantly. The blood clots are also a huge danger. Blood clots are usually treated with bloodthinning meds; however, because of the aneurism which could rupture, she cannot receive them until the aneurism is either ruled out or dealt with, somehow. She is aware of this now and admittedly, it's hard to stay the fear. She has had many nightmares about it.Her doctors at UCSF Medical Center where she is being treated are doing their best, but so far there isn't a diagnosis. And without that, there is no treatment. The reality is this: when aneurisms and embolisms (bloodclots) occur, they are usually signatures of a disease, but so far hers is unknown.*March 2015 Chemo Infusion at UCSFAt college, she planned to focus on her undergraduate studies of botany and coastal geology, and then go into teaching during grad school. At age 18, she excitedly left home to begin school at the University of CA at Santa Cruz (UCSC). Sadly, her first symptom of internal bleeding occured during her very first week. After 18 months of additional debilitating symptoms coming on, she was forced to take a medical leave. Now age 25, her stomach is paralyzed and she is very sick. Bed-bound most of the time now, she has a central line into her heart for meds and nourishment, and her nurses visit daily. *March 30, 2015 Urgent Care nurses overseeing emergency careShe’s on an unending, weekly regimen of chemotherapy because the doctors so far think the blood clots and aneurism are inoperable. In addition to the illness, this ongoing chemo cycle keeps her feeling quite ill. UCSF, the medical center in San Francisco where she is being treated, is aggressively trying to shrink both the clots and aneurism with chemotherapy. But at the end of the day, it is still very hard to have a treatment plan without a diagnosis. We must discover exactly what this illness is, in order to save her life.*Christmas 2014 ~ celebrated 2 weeks late due to illnessTo take Olivia on this trip requires funds I simply no longer have. I love and care for my precious, beautiful daughter around the clock. Any hope of me holding a 'normal' outside job again has become impossible. She cannot be left alone and we have no family at all to lean on or go to.We very much need help with funding this trip across country to the Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Yale School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Because there will be multiple appointments and quite a bit of time spent at each of these hospitals, this trip will easily extend out 4-8 months, or longer.  But it is being very carefully planned - and it is our only hope.With this journey ahead, we have hope.*Better days with best friend MomoThe financial picture - For our expenses, I have put 85k down as the GFM goal. After GFM fees are removed (not reflected in the above total), we are faced with many expenses for this journey, in addition to ongoing and extraordinary medical bills not covered by Olivia's medical insurance. We must have important medical supplies and medicines shipped overnight weekly from California during the entire trip.  Lodging will be the biggest expense, as well as gas & food.  We desperately need help building this fund to its goal. It's not easy making a trip like this happen, but it is a sincere lifesaving effort that we pray and hope for -- for O.* With pal Mo in Cody, WY, one month prior to the illness hitting - it became complete over a two-week periodFrom our hearts to yours, we thank you very much for any help possible. Thank you also for reading Olivia's story. Please kindly feel free to write to me if her symptoms sound familiar, or if you have any thoughts at all to share with us.                           Helen (mom) and Olivia Weber**Important notes**Please see newspaper articles about Olivia, written by reporter Kara Guzman at the Santa Cruz Sentinel in Santa Cruz, CA where O lives now: tinyurl.com/weber15 And also by reporter/columnist Chris Smith at the Santa Rosa Press Democrat in Sonoma County where O grew up: http://tinyurl.com/o63ezaj & http://tinyurl.com/ox3gv5zAbove all, we extend our thanks to everyone for the generous help that we've so gratefully received, as well as for the many kind messages, emails, prayers and comments on Olivia's behalf.

The meeting included eight students from various high schools and universities who are taking the lead on planning and organizing the Salt Lake City chapter of the national March for Our Lives.March for Our Lives is a national demonstration that has been called for by the survivors of the February 14th shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, who have emerged as a national voice for reform and action and will be marching on Washington, D.C. on March 24th. Cameron Kasky, an 11th grade student from Stoneman Douglas, had this to say on Sunday’s episode of “The Week”: “March 24th in every single city. We are going to be marching together as students begging for our lives. This isn't about the GOP, this isn't about the Democrats. This is about the adults. We feel neglected and at this point, you're either with us or against us.""Kasky’s classmate, Emma Gonzales, who gained national attention after her impassioned speech condemning President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association for their inaction, was asked what she would say to other students around the country to encourage them to join the protest. Gonzales, a high school senior, said “The kids who need to take part in this are kids, everyday kids just like us. They are students who need to understand that this can very quickly happen to them ... They need to join us, and they need to help us get our message across. All students should realize that a school shooting could happen anywhere.""With this sentiment in mind, local students have taken the lead on organizing a sister march in downtown Salt Lake City for Saturday, March 24th. In their meeting on Monday night, the group discussed the importance of not just accountability for organizations and politicians, but also the empowerment of their generation through voting and political involvement. Isaac Reese, President of the Brighton High School Young Democrats and one of the leaders of the planning committee, said “This coalition of Utah students is working to increase youth participation in preventing gun violence by using our voices to speak out and seek reform to gun safety regulations. We believe that students have a right to a safe education.” Other students present at the meeting included Brandon de Melo of Skyline High School, Aurora Allen and Meg Flynn of Brighton High School, Elizabeth Love and Wilhelmina Graff of West High School, Sophie Davies of Judge Memorial High School, and Matt Davis of Southern Utah University. Planning is still in early stages as the students work on solidifying logistical details.

This Program serves students in fifth grade through high school.  The kids who attend this school need more structure and support than traditional school settings can provide.   The last program I supervise is the Waukegan Foster Care Program.  This program serves over 60 youth who are living in foster care placements while their parents work toward reunifying their families.   The bottom line is that the State of Illinois has never stayed current with the actual costs of providing care for kids who have been abused, neglected or abandoned. Social Services are always the first areas targeted in state budget crises. If you would like to make a donation to support these worthy children and teens, I promise to make sure that your donation is used to support the academic, social, emotional and/or cultural and recreational needs of the kids.  One Hope United is a 501 (c) 3 non profit organization so any donation you make will be tax deductible.  I will make sure you receive  a letter acknowledging your donation. Thank you for considering a gift.  If you cannot give, please say a prayer for the vulnerable in our society. God works in mysterious ways and hopefully, in 2017 and we can watch His miracles unfold! Merry Christmas everyone and have a safe and peace filled new year!Ann(Deuel to you Poirier)"

We’ve created a limited edition (1,000) commemorative egg to raise money for the vital programs the current administration is promising to defund, but that are so important to American children and families. It’s in the spirit of the wooden eggs that have been given as souvenirs for so many years at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.Our alternative “America’s Easter Egg” is a symbol of renewal, rebirth, and our dream of the future. Given the rhetoric and policies coming out of the White House, it’s fitting — imperative — that we create a different choice that reflects the values we want for our children, and that we want our country to stand for.When you donate $15.00, we’ll send you our exclusive “Protect Our Children’s Future” wooden Easter egg and  @$10.00 of your donation (after expenses**) will be divided equally and distributed to           The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (PBS)      (Local Affiliate:  MPT--Maryland Public Television)          The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)     (Specifically the Big Reads Program and the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards) (**The @$5.00 is for the out-of-pocket costs to manufacture, box, and ship the eggs. All of the labor is volunteered. *There is a total fee of 8% for using the GoFundMe Site.)It’s called an ""Easter” egg, but the egg is a broader symbol of the potential for our children to enjoy a brighter future — where the grass grows green, the air is clean, and children of every race, color, religion, nationality, and gender can joyfully roll eggs and celebrate the beauty of spring and the cherished principles of freedom, justice, and inclusiveness that make our country great (already).It’s a great way for you and your family, and ours, to affirm that “love trumps hate,” to counter the deconstruction of organizations that do so much to educate our families. And to make a statement that we are unwilling to accept policies that portend a dark future for our children. Let's start with an egg. Let's fund Big Bird and organizations that make a difference in children's lives.We encourage everyone to host their own “America’s House” Easter Egg rolls and to proudly display the “Protect Our Children’s Future” egg.We will ship the ""alternative"" America’s Easter Egg 2017 to you the first week of April. (Domestic shipping only. You will receive one egg in pastel pink, blue, green, or violet; sorry, but we can’t fulfill orders for specific colors.) Please email me if you have questions about the egg please email me. I will ship one for each $15 donation. Help spread the word!Some Background:Why do we say the “official” White House Easter Egg Roll may or may not happen? Petula Dvorak reported in her column in The Washington Post: “...no one has heard that any of the work is being done on this year’s event with only seven weeks to go. A website that is not associated with the White House but is obsessed with the Easter Egg roll posted that the roll is set to be held on April 17 and promised that details will soon follow. But go to the official White House website and you get “no results” when you ask about anything Easter-related. And my efforts to reach anyone at the White House about it were unsuccessful.”On March 9, Donald Trump announced that there will be an Easter Egg Roll, but that there will be ""new traditions.""  The collectible egg, apparently, is not part of that plan. How big a deal is the White House Easter Egg Roll? It’s been going on since 1898, when local children convinced President Rutherford B. Hayes to let them roll eggs on the White House lawn, after Congress kicked them off the Capitol grounds. In 2016, 35,000 people attended the last roll hosted by the Obamas.A personal note: From the time that my children were small, until they outgrew the hunt, I brought my children to the White House to participate in this fun family event, and/or purchased the souvenir eggs. Now that my children are grown, I still love the hunt and want to find a productive and positive way to participate. I have Bush, Clinton, and Obama era eggs in my collection… no matter the administration in power, I always supported this annual event. And I want it to continue. Republican or Democrat, I loved the tradition and trust that the people elected a President who had my children’s future in consideration when he made executive decisions.This president has broken that trust with his anti-family, anti-children, anti-education platform. I may be one person, but I hope that this campaign will help to deliver my message."

THE HEART:  WOC Art Collaborative is a multi-generational collective of Black women & women of color creators in Rochester NY committed to bringing the power of their individual accomplishments, visions, and social justice practices to create an institution rooted in intersectional equity for women, femme, gender-variant and nonbinary artists of color.   “We can join together to effect a future the world has not yet conceived, let alone seen.” — Audre Lorde 

""Remember that consciousness is power. Consciousness is education and knowledge. Consciousness is becoming aware. It is the perfect vehicle for students. Consciousness-raising is pertinent for power, and be sure that power will not be abusively used, but used for building trust and goodwill domestically and internationally. Tomorrow's world is yours to build.""—Yuri Kochiyama  

THE MISSION: 

In 2016, the Democrat & Chronicle reported this startling data, ""Monroe County ranks fifth worst in the nation in the median household income gap between white residents and residents of color.""  For low-income, majority-black neighborhoods across the United States, this is an all-too-familiar narrative. As an artist-driven, multi-cultural collective, WOC Art recognizes the intrinsic value in developing a space exclusively for Rochester's most marginalized residents. It is our mission to center women artists of color who exist in a landscape in which their work, perspectives and bodies are underrepresented.   

 We are thrilled to have a physical space where artistic and cultural activities can flourish. We are launching this campaign to help with our first year of rent as we establish this groundbreaking collective:

  WOC Art Collaborative at Gallery Seventy Four provides 2,700 square feet of performance, rehearsal, creation and exhibition space for its members. Here, we will work to foster community engagement and preservation by collaborating with fellow artists and cultural workers.  Authentic cultural expression (for artists of color, by artists of color) is the key to unlocking inspiration, hope and civic engagement with our people to help reimagine community identity.  In order to save ourselves, we must, first, see ourselves.   

THE BRAINS:   Rachel Y. DeGuzman is CEO of 21st Century Arts and ARTivist in Residence at Gallery Seventy Four. The focus of her work is decentering whiteness in arts/culture by centering the art, narratives & voices of people of color - especially women & marginalized LGBTQ communities. In fulfillment of that vision, she established “At the Crossroads: Activating the Intersection of Art and Justice” and then organized and initiated the founding of WOCˑArt Collaborative.N’Jelle Gage-Thorne is president of FuturPointe Dance, which she co-founded in 2009 with the vision to re-introduce Caribbean creative diversity in the dance community and to promote cross-cultural dialogue and conviviality.

We find ways to build it up instead.Montanans are a diverse group of people, who are fiercely independent, tolerant of each other, and close neighbors. As such, we stand together.  We are tired of bitter partisanship and politicians who seek to label and divide us. We will not be defined by rants and tweets.  We will no longer be told who holds the rights to patriotism. We have no time for hate in our state. We stand together against racism, misogyny, hatred and xenophobia in all forms. As Montanans, we know when something is broken, we fix it. If a mess is made, we clean it up.  If someone is sick, we nurse them back to health. If a bully tries to take over, we seek justice.  Montanans can disagree, but still accomplish great things, together.We are asking you to contribute funds to overcome the impression that Montanans agree with the statements by Senator Daines. You can also list your name in the ad by giving us your full name and city as part of a comment when donating.  Please feel free to give a contribution without having your name listed.   Please note that adding your full name and city in the comments is considered permission to be listed in the ad. Thank you in advance for raising your voice in this crucial moment.  We cannot let the Senator's words define Montana."

$10,340 raised of $45,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/build-45,"San Juan, PR",Build 45!,"Created February 28, 2019","Build 45!Puerto Rico’s Walkway of the Presidents, located on the grounds of the Capitol Buildingin San Juan, was inaugurated in 2010 to commemorate the American Presidents whohave visited the U.S. Caribbean territory.Due to the insolvency of the territorial government, which has been under federal fiscalsupervision since 2016, expenses for non-essential public services and works projectshave been curtailed, and the current Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly’s lack of actionto both commission and put in place the pending statue commemorating PresidentTrump’s October 3, 2017 visit to Puerto Rico has been blamed on this reality.In view of the above, it is only fitting that patriotic citizens, both in Puerto Rico andthroughout the United States, unite to contribute the funds necessary to build andinaugurate a statue of President Trump along Puerto Rico’s Walkway of the Presidents.According to news reports, it cost approximately $25,000 to build each of the currentnine bronze statues honoring the Presidents in Puerto Rico.To cover all the costs of completing and inaugurating the statue of President Trump, theRepublican National Hispanic Assembly of Virginia and the College Republicans ofPuerto Rico have launched the joint GoFundMe campaign Build 45!, to which everyoneis invited to contribute, in whatever amount they would like, until we reach the $45,000goal.President Trump visited Puerto Rico in its greatest time of need, in the immediateaftermath of Hurricane María. Contrary to the fake news narrative, when it comes toPuerto Rico, President Trump has been extraordinarily attentive and generous,including seven meetings with Puerto Rico’s Democrat Governor, Ricardo Rosselló. Inreality, Puerto Rico has received extra generous treatment from President Trump, whogiven the fiscal mess in the territory decided to waive the normal 25% requirement forlocal government cost-sharing of emergency recovery work and authorized 100%federal funding of that work for nearly a year.During the first six months following the disaster, total FEMA funding for Puerto Ricoreached $9.9 billion, more than the entire annual budget of the island’s centralgovernment, and more than any other disaster in U.S. history at that same point in time,with the exception of Hurricane Katrina. The Trump administration’s supply of food andwater for Puerto Rico was the largest and longest domestic air and sea mission of food,water, commodities and electrical generators in American history.Altogether, it is projected that Puerto Rico will benefit from $91 billion in federal disaster recovery aid, including $20 billion in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development community development block grants, the largest allocation of that type in the agency’s history.It is also worth keeping in mind that the statues in Puerto Rico’s Walkway of thePresidents do not represent an official endorsement of the policy record of each of thevarious Presidents, but rather simply commemorate the historical fact of their visits tothe United States of America’s largest remaining territory.Finally, no matter what his detractors say, following the horrific hurricane of 2017,Puerto Rico is being rebuilt better than it was before, and that rebuilding is due in nosmall part to the actions of President Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his abidinglove for the people of Puerto Rico, such as on September 27, 2017 when he declaredthat “Puerto Rico is very important to me, and Puerto Rico—the people are fantasticpeople. I grew up in New York, so I know many people from Puerto Rico. I know manyPuerto Ricans. And these are great people, and we have to help them.”That is why it is now altogether fitting that patriotic Americans in Puerto Rico andthroughout the nation undertake this joint campaign to build and facilitate theinauguration of a historic commemorative statue of President Trump on Puerto Rico’sWalkway of the Presidents.If you donate to our campaign, the funds will be received by the College Republican Federation of Puerto Rico, a non-profit organization incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. I, Fernando Jimenez, the organizer, am the current Chairman of the organization. The funds proceeding from GoFundMe shall be deposited in the organization's Banco Popular bank account in Puerto Rico. As Chairman of the organization I am responsible for how the money shall be spent. The cost of building the statue is between $35,000 to $40,000; however, there might be additional costs that may appear in the process of transporting the statue, placing the pedestal for the bronze plaque  explaining President Trump's visit (which is estimated to cost around $6,850), and unveiling it. We want to spend this money wisely. We remind you that the purpose of this campaign, for which we seek your generous contribution, is to preserve a historic tradition in Puerto Rico; the commissioning of statues of the U.S. Presidents that have visited the island while in office. The statues are placed on the grounds of Puerto Rico's Capitol Building. Your contribution is not destined to be spent on a political campaign. We hope to reach our goal and see you in Puerto Rico once the statue is inaugurated.At the request of GoFundMe, we inform you that the funds will be withdrawn by Jo-Ann Chase, who is co-leading this effort with me. GoFundMe does not let residents of Puerto Rico to withdraw their money to a Puerto Rican bank account. GoFundMe also requires the person to have an address in one of the 50 states, and Mrs. Chase complies with this requirement. Mrs. Chase has already opened an account with United Bank in Virginia that is destined to receive the donations from GoFundMe. Mrs. Chase and I are always in contact throughout this campaign and we will continue working to  get the funds to the College Republican Federation of Puerto Rico so we can BUILD 45!"

I'm Lulu Friesdat. I'm an Emmy award-winning journalist and documentary filmmaker  focusing on election security.  I have worked extensively with all of the major news networks, and my work has also appeared on HBO. My election security investigations have been featured on Politico, Now This, MSN.com, the Christian Science Monitor, The Young Turks, Truthout.org, Alternet, and Salon. With your help, I will be covering the 2nd DEF CON Voting Machine Hacking Village, and reporting on what voting machines hackers are able to access, and what that means for election security in the upcoming 2018 midterms elections.I will also be asking election officials who are there - What are they learning?- How they will change their practices to increase the security and accuracy of their count?HERE'S WHAT HAPPENING THIS YEAR!The Voting Village is going to be holding a mock election.  If hackers are able to change the results of that election - I know you are going to want to see it. Last year I was one of the only journalists who filmed and released video of the hackers actually working on the machines. Please help make sure I can be there again!The Voting Village is also reportedly going to have optical scanners this year.  Hackers will be trying to manipulate the results of optical scan machines, and if they are successful - that is a game changer.  It may be possible, especially if any of the scanners are using wireless modems, which have been shown to create security risks . Many counties are using wireless modems in their scanners. For example, I confirmed with Dane County Wisconsin that  “a little over ½ of the county’s voting equipment,” is using wireless modems.The video that I shot and edited at last year's DEF CON received over a million views. The video that I shot and edited  about how easy it would be to hack all of the electronic voting machines in Ohio, with access to just one polling location, has received almost two million views .DEF CON 2017 was one of the most influential events of the election season. After reading the security report from DEF CON , Virginia decertified all of its electronic voting equipment. In the election that followed, Democrats picked up 16 seats. ""The results marked the most sweeping shift in control of the legislature since Reconstruction ."" The 16 new Democrats and three Republicans ""include many firsts : an Asian-American woman, the first Latinas, the first lesbian and the first transgender woman to serve in the legislature."" There is no way of knowing if the change in voting equipment contributed to the change in power, because many of the earlier elections were on machines with no paper trail and therefore cannot be audited. But elected officials made it clear that their decision to abandon touch screen machines was ""partly out of concern that their security had been compromised at DefCon."" I know you want to help make sure that we have a well-produced record of the work that takes place at DEF CON this year, and that you are able to see what happens! So much is at stake in these upcoming midterm elections - this footage can be very influential in persuading election officials and congress that they need to take urgent action to protect our very vulnerable election process.Whether you can give $5 or $500, or something in between I need your support. If you can afford to give $25, $50,  or even $100, I would be extremely grateful. Vegas is expensive, and I have to pay for transportation, lodging, new camera equipment, and food. The total is going to be around $4,000. Please do give as much as you can today.Thank you so much for everything you are doing to help make our elections more secure and accurate!"

She identifies as British, and over the last 18 years has built a life here, with friends, family, work and social commitments and been shaped by the culture, been to college and university in the UK, voted, worked and paid taxes.Bumi was taken to Nigeria as a minor at age 3 by her father and she returned as soon as she was old enough to get a passport of her own at age 18. She returned to the UK with the belief she was British with dual nationality and acted accordingly. Her national Insurance number issued at birth meant she could work legally without any restrictions. It wasn’t until she was 25 after university when she applied for her British passport and she was informed that her Father had never registered her as British which became a legal requirement 5 months before her birth. Bumi was told that her case was complex, a ‘Border Native’ outside the system and she was sanctioned for technically overstaying in the UK in an illegal capacity. This meant that she was told that ""normal"" immigration criteria no longer applied and she must use complex human rights provisions ""outside the immigration system"" This was the start of an exhausting and expensive 10 year battle that has resulted in a refusal for either discretionary or indefinite Leave to remain in June 2019 but with the right to Appeal.I applied for Settlement in the UK (Indefinite Leave to Remain) in Nov 2018 Which was refused on the 7th of June 2019. I have grounds for an appeal which must be filed by Friday the 21st of June, or face detention and possible deportation. I was born in Glasgow in  June 1983 on the cusp of the British Nationality Act which  was enforced in January 1983.  So my identity came into question with the Nationality Act passed by Margaret Thatcher in January 1983 which states that children born to parents from the colonies are no longer entitled to automatic citizenship. This singular decision has caused a profound displacement in my psyche and on going reality where I have been relegated to the realm of a ‘Border Native’’ an official refugee in my own country.Most of my life has been spent in the UK, it has been my home, the birthplace of my voice and evolution as an artist. My talents and  personal reality was nurtured here. This forced return will cause a rift in the fabric of who I am as a human being.It is firmly rooted in the  The UK Home Office hostile environment policy, a set of administrative and legislative measures designed to make staying in the United Kingdom as difficult as possible for people without leave to remain, in the hope that they may ""voluntarily leave”. The policy also implemented a more complicated application process to get 'leave to remain' based on the principle of 'deport first, appeal later', whilst encouraging voluntary deportation though strategies including ""Go Home"" vans as part of ""Operation Vaken""A 2018 governmental review revealed the Home Office had tried to deport at least 300 highly skilled migrants (including teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers and IT professionals) under the 322(5) provision, at least 87 successfully. This mostly affected people who had lived in the UK for more than 10 years and have children born in the UK. Many were given only 14 days to leave the UK and were made ineligible to apply for visas to return. The review found that 65% of 322(5) decisions were overturned by an upper tribunal and 45% of applicants for judicial review were successful (28% of judicial reviews find in favour of the defendant). Additionally the review found that 32% of ""complex cases"" were wrongly decidedI  really need your help and support to fight this decision, the funds  raised will be used to pay for the services of an experienced Immigration  Specialist who will draft a strong argument and file the appeal on my behalf on Human Rights Grounds.This is a very time sensitive campaign as the  application MUST be submitted by this Friday the 21st of June. Please make a donation to my cause and advocate peace in the face of critical displacement.Your support at the pivotal crossroads in my life is simply invaluable.

I’m a senior at Miami University from the Metro Detroit area majoring in biology with dreams of attending med school. At Miami I’m deeply involved in my community as a Supplemental Instructor for the biology department, a senator for the Associated Student Government, the Vice President of the College Democrats, and an undergrad researcher in medical decision making. This was supposed to be the best year of my life so far as I had everything: leadership roles on campus, lots of good friends, the position as the most senior student in my lab, time to study for the MCAT, and a schedule of classes I love with great professors.Just before the school year started I was assaulted during welcome weekend. I reported this to the school and sought out help as I was determined to make the best of the school year and not let this distract me. I personally emailed all of my professors and told my closest friends. I individually met with my professors and made plans to be able to still get the best education possible. I thought that by simply studying hard and exercising during my free time I would be fine, but this quickly unraveled as the lasting affects of the assault began to bleed into my life. I lost several close friends and began to feel unwelcome in my own classes. I have struggled with anxiety previously, but the nightmares I have experienced since have made sleep nearly impossible. I’ve been on Miami’s campus for 4 years but soon felt nervous and unsafe everywhere I went. Getting out of bed and eating became increasingly difficult as I began to struggle socially. Meanwhile, the Title IX investigation has been an exhausting experience even with the support and courtesy of the office of Community Standards and its staff.Throughout this I had hope that I would only be struggling temporarily, and that my life would soon return to normal as long as I worked hard and asked for the help that I needed. Being able to access counseling, go to constant Title IX meetings, and being continuously humiliated has been a 2 month long constant battle. Things however took a turn for the worst with an incident around Halloween that made me aware of how unwelcome I was on campus. After staying awake for nearly 3 days from stress and losing a significant amount of weight since the beginning of the year, I decided it was time to medically withdraw from classes.The plan to come home and recover while the investigation proceeds before returning to school has been complicated by the news from Miami’s finance office that my scholarship had been “liquidated”. Seeing my mom cry and stress over $15,000 after her stroke is a heartache unlike any other.  I never thought I would have to resort to a GoFundMe, this has by far been the most humiliating aspect of my life since being assaulted. My doctor has insisted I need to be catching up on sleep and regaining some weight, but it's nearly impossible to relax with the thoughts of growing financial burdens and the future of my education weighing down on me. I would really be grateful for any donation for the rest of my life, and I am going to continue to advocate for my scholarship from Miami as well as apply for more. Even if you can't donate, sharing this as well as taking time to read about the impacts of SIV would mean a lot to me. I never knew that post-assault I would struggle to sit still and hate being touched to the point where I don't want my hair cut. I promise that if I were able to finish my education at Miami University, I would continue to be an active member in my community and use my experience to advocate for more resources and better treatment of survivors."

Morgantown NOW is actively fighting this fundamentalist attack on women's reproductive rights but our opponents are out in force. We urgently need additional funding in order to keep abortion legal, accessible, and safe in West Virginia.What are we fighting?Amendment 1 would take away a woman's constitutional right to safe, medically necessary abortion in West Virginia. It makes absolutely no exceptions—not if the woman's life were in danger, not if she had been raped, not if the pregnancy resulted from incest, not for fetal viability.Amendment 1 states, ""Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion."" The bill was adopted on March 5, 2018. Lawmakers were given the opportunity to introduce exceptions and they refused. Senator Corey Palumbo, D-Kanawha, proposed a motion to add exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s life. But senators rejected that motion. Most immediately, Amendment 1 would allow the WV Legislature to bar poor women from making their own health decisions about their own bodies by preventing Medicaid from being used for abortions. West Virginia is one of only 17 states that currently allows Medicaid to be used for this purpose.But Amendment 1 is also a way to make abortion illegal for the first time in nearly fifty years. If Amendment 1 is approved and Roe v. Wade is then overturned, all abortion in West Virginia will immediately be criminalized. An older statute, West Virginia Code §61-2-8, would automatically come into effect, and it would make providing an abortion a felony.What are we fundraising for?We have already raised $1,000 offline. We need additional funding to rebut the many false claims being made by the YES campaign, educate voters on this under-reported issue, and protect women's constitutional right to safe, legal abortion.If we raise an additional $1,500, we will add this to our existing $1,000 to buy 500 VOTE NO yard signs ($2,500 at a cost of $5 per sign) to distribute around Morgantown and across West Virginia. Design time has been donated for free.If we raise $2,900, we will buy 500 VOTE NO yard signs plus create and distribute a brief voter guide for voters in rural areas. We will pay $400 for research and writing (we have a student researcher lined up and will pay $10 per hour for 40 hours) and we'll spend the remaining $1000 on printing and distribution. The voter guide will combat the falsehoods of the YES campaign and provide necessary facts. It needs to be distributed by mail, incurring higher costs (printing and mailing) because West Virginia has a rural and dispersed population, many of whom have limited if any internet access.If we raise $4,300, we will buy 500 VOTE NO yard signs plus create and distribute an extended voter guide for rural voters. We will pay $800 for research and writing ($10 per hour for 80 hours) and spend the remaining $2000 on distributing materials to every corner of the state, plus a social media campaign, plus sending postcards to registered Democrats explaining the issue and reminding them to get out and vote.Who are we?We're the Morgantown chapter of the National Organization for Women and are based in the same town as West Virginia University, the state's flagship institution. We were revived in 2017 after a two decade dormancy, as we recognized the urgent need for feminist grassroots activism in our city, throughout West Virginia, and across the United States. We're a diverse group made up of teachers, professors, medical professionals (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and counselors), artists, small business owners, students, retirees, university administrators, state and federal representatives and candidates, lawyers, librarians, and community organizers. We have an active membership of fifty people who regularly attend meetings, as well as nearly 300 people in our Facebook group, over 400 people following our Facebook page, and over 200 people on our email list.

There’s a quiet rebellion against socialism in NY-CD14, which Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (#BronxBolshevik) is running to represent.

Block Bronx Bolshevik is a grassroots campaign to raise awareness that Joseph Crowley remains on the ballot on the Working Families Party line, and to encourage Democrats and Republicans in CD-14 to vote for him in the general election.

NY-CD14 is politically moderate and middle class—we're swing voters, not socialists. Crowley is the  only viable alternative to socialsim  for  Democrats and Republicans alike, because the GOP candidate is an underfunded unknown who is destined to go down to defeat. A vote for Anthony Pappas is indirectly a vote for #BronxBolshevik. We want to raise $3000 to buy Facebook ads that will promote the Block Bronx Bolshevik Facebook Page    to increase the numbers of likes, shares and engagements. The Block Bronx Bolshevik Facebook page serves as a watercooler for the residents of CD14 who believe that #BronxBolshevik doesn't belong in Congress, as well as for their friends and allies. There is a lot of interesting (and funny) content on the page. 

Closer to Election Day, individual posts  on this page about how to vote for Joseph Crowley on the third party line will be promoted.

At the proper time, there will also be media outreach to clue in all the uninformed ""teevee pundits"" that an  anti-socialist rebellion is underway in CD14, and that #BronxBolshevik may not have the election in the bag after all.Thank you for your help in saving the already over-taxed voters in CD14  from socialism.

Sioux Z and myself will be speaking at Occupy Inauguration January 20th in Washington D.C. I'm waiting to hear back from Efrain to see if he can make it. I've been put in charge of organizing all the musicians who have been to Standing Rock. My job is to get them out to Washington D.C. for Occupy Inauguration. Donald Trump has promised to grant the easment the Obama halted to drill under the Missouri River on the Standing Rock Sioux's land. Chase Iron Eyes will be leading a march on Inauguration Day in Washington D.C. and I need help getting to Washington D.C. myself. If you can please donate to Sophie Wilansky and Sioux Z. Their medical bills are astronomical.  I need help unfortunately to help pay for my plane ticket and hotel room in D.C. this has been the craziest year of my life and I want to thank everyone who has helped me accomplish all my goals thus far.

I literally got a flat tire on the way there and only reason I was able to afford to fix it was your guy's donations. I'm incredibly humbled by your support and I'll never be able to thank  you all enough. Jill Stein won't be able to travel any farther north in California. Mostly due to a bout of pneumonia. She's better now but traveling less. We wanted to set up a rally in Mendocino and Humboldt Counties on Nov.5th and 6th for all the Greens and Bernie Sanders supporters who support Jill.  We're looking to have Jill Stein's Campaign Manager David Cobb, Bernie Delegate Bobby Shearer from Arcata Ca. (who was at the DNC in Philly) and all the Green Candidates from their counties and they have several of them. Humboldt was the highest percentage for Bernie Sanders in the Primary and they are an active communtiy of Progressives. Please help us set up this final rally for our Progressive brothers and sisters on the lost coast. Thank you all so much again. Hello! :)   My name is Erik Rydberg. I ran for District Delegate for Bernie Sanders in California District 1. I joined the Green Party when Dr.Cornel West abstained from the Democratic Platform. I learned a lot about organizing and social media from the Bernie Campaign and I have since been appointed as the State Volunteer Coordinator for the Jill Stein Campaign in California. My job has been organizing 7,000+ Volunteers who signed up on jill2016.com and help create Volunteer Lists for every County Green Party in the State to contact. CA has 58 Counties and there were 34 Active Counties. Now we are on our way to having 46 Active Counties and all 58 counties activated by 2017.   Another responsibility of my job has been to give every county party in the state links for FREE MATERIALS from jill2016.com Stickers, Fliers, Buttons, etc. as well as a one time bulk order of T-Shirts from jill2016.com with a 95% Off Discount Code.    I have managed to get these links to Materials, T-Shirts and Volunteers Lists into the hands of every County Party in the State, allowing them to instantly grow their County Parties by calling these eager Volunteers which are mostly former Bernie Sanders supporters like myself.   The Jill Stein Campaign, GPCA Coordinating Committee members and many County Parties have suggested that I set up a GoFundMe account in order to help fund my activities through out the state. I have recently been in as many as 3 different Counties in a day, helping them with Activation Meetings, Parades, #NoDAPL protests as well as organizing California Events for Dr.Cornel West in Sacramento Sept.29th, YahNe Ndgo in Chico Oct.12th and Dr.Jill Stein in Sacramento/San Jose Oct.22. I've also been helping our local Green Candidate for City Council Mercedes Macias organizing Speeches with YahNe Ndgo, #NoDAPL rally speeches and Interviews with local news stations. As well I am putting together a program for the County Parties to speak with all the local Highschools in their area. Every highschool has AP classes that allow them to earn early College Credits. Most highschools require these students to Volunteer 10 Hrs. of Volunteer Time to a Campaign to earn their credits. Under the training of Ben Emery(Ran for Congress on the Green Party ticket from Nevada County) I've watched as Ben picks up 25 Volunteers in a day, times 10 Hrs. each that's 250 Hrs. of Volunteer Time and simultaneously educating these millennials who will be able to vote in 2020 about the Green Party. I'm also working with all my fellow Native Americans in the State and acrossed the Country to for a Native Caucus within the Green Party.   Hopefully this gives you an idea of how much is happening, particularly in the Green Party of California. The GPCA is mostly a Volunteer Party and there aren't any paid positions available. I've been asked to set up this GoFundMe so that I can continue this valuable work until election day Nov.8th. Here is a list of events that I've been asked to participate in, organize and attend as a speaker on behalf of the Jill Stein Campaign, the Native Caucus and the Emery AP Students Program.Oct. 6th: Jill Stein rally in Oakland and SFOct.11th: Nevada County Activation MeetingOct. 12th: YahNe Ndgo rally at Chico State University Oct.13th: Butte College Fireside DebatesOct.14th: Placerville AP Students PresentationOct.15th: Merced County Activation Meeting, Speaking at Green Party of Fresno County Rally on behalf of Jill 2016, Volunteer Coordinators and the Native Caucus.Oct. 21st: Guest Speaker on Nevada County RadioOct.22nd: Jill Stein Rally UCDavis and UCBerkleyOct.24th: Chico State Wildcat VoteNov.9th: Post Election Debate with local Republicans and Democrats on KZFR radio.Here are a few things that I've already done up to this point.July 12th: Joined the Green Party.

Rallies and speeches all over California. As a Volunteer I've finally come to the end of my finacila rope and I need assistance continuing this work until Nov.8th. My main goal aside from getting Jill and Ajamu Baraka elected. Is building this progressive 3rd Party for 2020. The best way to do this is by bringing in as many new members as possible between now and the election. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Solidarity,Erik RydbergGreen Party of Butte Countyjill2016.com State Volunteer CoordinatorHere are some of the people encouraging me to raise funds. Many thanks to all of them.Erik Rydberg is one of those with fire in his belly for change. He has taken on the job of helping counties in California re activate or start their first Green Party. Driving all over the state helping plant the seeds for the future of the Green Party in California is not an easy task, in fact it takes time, energy, passion, and as does everything it takes money. The Green Party is growing and unless we prepare and are ready for that growth we just might lose those young energized activists and future leaders. Lets keep Erik on the road and in doing so make sure future progressives aren’t forced into corrupt political parties so they can be seen in the media and taken seriously by the electorate.Ben EmeryLong Time Green Party Member2010 US Congressional CandidateOver the past several months, Erik has done great work on Jill’s campaign, by assisting and encouraging volunteers throughout northern California . So let’s help him out now, so he can keep working for us through election day -- as we enter the critical ""home stretch"" of the campaign! -- Greg Jan, founding member, Green Party of California; California Coordinator, Jill Stein for President; former state Coordinating Committee member, and former Campaigns and Candidates Working Group Co-Chair, Green Party of CaliforniaErik Rydberg has seemingly boundless energy, and he is effective. I first heard from Erik when he called me for advice before he was interviewed as a Bernie Sanders supporter who switched to the Green Party. Erik is a natural spokesperson, and a natural organizer. He constantly reaches out — via Facebook, email, texts, phone calls. He gets advice; invites people to local and state events, enrolls them as volunteers; helps activate local Green Parties in his own county and counties around the state. He became an unpaid volunteer coordinator for the Jill Stein campaign and has followed through on hundreds of contacts. Most recently I saw him outside an overflow Cornel West event in Sacramento, on a bullhorn encouraging people to register Green and support Jill Stein. Erik Rydberg is the type of young activist the Green Party — and the country — needs, and I am happy to contribute as much as I can financially so that he will be able to sustain his effective efforts.

As O's mother & caregiver, I'm unable to return to work because it means she would be left alone.She is seen at 2 UC Med Centers in CA that are 500 miles apart -- we greatly need help with the expenses associated with these frequent road trips (lodging, car upkeep, gas, food, overnight medical supplies, etc.).We just desperately need funding for these on-the-road expenses to keep her medical care going.Thank you for reading Olivia's story.  Validations about her are below, or please google ""Olivia Weber Santa Cruz"" or ""Olivia Weber Analy"". Olivia is always upbeat and definitely ready to feel better.  She just wants to return to college, finish her degree and live her life.  Before the illness, she was a fast-track student and athlete majoring in Geology and Botany and planning her graduate work.   We never saw this coming.Please watch this wonderful video of Olivia with her Golden Retriever Mo from 2018.  Thank you :-)Below: ICU.  First walk 5 days after having  a Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy - Sept. 2017Below- Just out of the ICU on 9/20/17, she is actually pressing the bear against her full sternum incision, using a teddy bear instead of the standard pillowOlivia has had many surgeriesOlivia was always a healthy, devoted scholar & lifetime athlete.

In peacefully showing our resolve by sitting in, 51 young people were arrested during this action.  Donate to the bail fund of the brave young people who put their bodies on the line. We peacefully delivered letters, we told our stories, we sang, we chanted and we sat-in at Nancy Pelosi’s office demanding that our Democratic Leadership treat the climate crisis with the seriousness it deserves.  Our demands:1. Champion a Green Jobs for All platform to guarantee a job to any person who wants one to transform our society and economy over the next decade to stop climate change. Protect the lives of all working people -- black, brown, and white -- from the ravages of disaster and pollution.2. Mandate that any Democrat in leadership must take the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge and reject campaign contributions from fossil fuel executives and lobbyists and instead prioritize the health of people and planet over industry profits.  It takes courage to put yourself on the line and subject yourself to physical, legal and financial risk for the values we hold.  Now our community needs to have these brave young people’s back.  Join us in raising the $5,000 we need to cover these young people’s bail and legal costs.  Let’s stand with them.  Let’s empower this generation to keep fighting for the future we all deserve._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________About me and the plan to get the funds to these young people:  I am an active member of Sunrise Movement and head the New York City chapter.

We covered that campaign as well or better than any news outlet in the country for the New American Journal and were able to make a significant difference in that special election: https://www.newamericanjournal.netBreitbart is not in the news business to make money from web ads and clickbait like all the other for-profit news outfits in the land.

He is on a mission to destroy the credibility of long-standing mainstream news organizations in America. I have been a critic of the MSM since I began publishing independently on the web back in the 1990s, but these guys want to turn the United States into a confused, cowed oligopoly. They will use the Christian right in this endeavor, even though they don't care one whit for ""Christian values.""The New York Times and the Washington Post are now saying they are ""sanguine"" about their financial futures, but even they admit there is a crisis in local news.

Unfortunately, even today in our very modern society, gender equality is protected only for women's voting rights, as specified in the Nineteenth Amendment. Our own State Department required Afghanistan to write gender equality into their new Constitution but we do not yet have it in ours. Almost 100 years ago, citizens petitioned for the addition of very simple wording to our Constitution, the Equal Rights Amendment: Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.Under Republican leadership, the Equal Rights Amendment finally passed Congress in 1972 and has since been ratified by 36 of the 38 required states for it to take effect nation-wide. The most recent ratification occurred in Nevada on March 22, 2017.Virginia is one of 14 states that has not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. Public support of an Equal Rights Amendment is incredibly high (generally 94%+, source: http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm#q17) and the majority of Americans believe the Equal Rights Amendment is already ratified.Five times since 2010 the Virginia Senate has passed a bill, in a bipartisan manner, that would ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Each of those same five years the House of Delegates has failed to move the same wording out of committee.During the 2018 General Assembly session a coalition of citizens and organizations requested bipartisan support for the Equal Rights Amendment. For the first time ever the resolutions were patroned in a bipartisan manner (2 Republican + 19 Democrat Senators; 4 Republican + 47 Democrat Delegates). Although the 2018 push was not quite enough we believe 2019 will continue to build in bipartisan synergy and as citizens spread awareness of the issue more citizen lobbyists will join the effort. All children in the United States should have Constitutionally guaranteed gender equality. It is time to finish this campaign to benefit all Americans.Your financial support is so greatly appreciated and will ensure that your voice is heard by your Virginia Delegate/Senator. So please pick a comfortable level of financial support, spread the word, and join us in Virginia's Equal Rights Amendment ratification effort!NOTE: This bipartisan campaign is solely focused on this topic. Net monies raised will be used exclusively for Virginia Equal Rights Amendment ratification campaign / materials. If the Equal Rights Amendment is ratified in Virginia and there is money remaining from this campaign it will be moved to campaigners in the state next most likely to ratify.  "

Due to issues with his houseboat, he was been stuck in Natchez, MS for a month; he is still in Venice doing more work on his boat before he embarks on a trip to Gulfport, MS. He unfortunately lost his longtime canine companion, Sapphire. He got a new friend named Shameless. —Kelly’s story (link)--Kelly's facebook After learning he had only three months to live, Wisconsin-native Kelly Phillips took a leap of faith into the Mississippi River, literally.Kelly said he was diagnosed with sinus cancer more than two years ago and in early 2016 decided to spend his remaining days living in a houseboat and floating down the Mississippi River.After undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy, Phillips developed an ulcer in his stomach that exploded, he said. He woke up 21 days later in hospice and was told he had three months to live.“I just woke up in hosipce and decided, ‘What the heck, let’s do this,’” Phillips said. “There is really no reasoning behind the decision, except for it just coming to me. Might as well do it. I don’t have any other plans.”Phillips got a houseboat and began his journey down the Mississippi River in Madison, Wisconsin, on March 15, 2017, and has been floating down the river ever since. Throughout his journey on the Mississippi, Phillips said he believes he has encountered God’s presence countless times. And although Phillips said he believed 100-percent in God before his adventure, the trip has strengthened his faith in God even more. Throughout his trip, Phillips said floating down river has restored his faith in humanity. After the people from the agency who found Sapphire in Memphis reunited the two, the office decided buy him a new generator and cell phone.“It’s been wonderful,” Phillips said.Phillips said he is appreciative of everyone who has helped along the way thus far, but he is just happy to have met them and looks forward to meeting more people.“I want to keep meeting people,” Phillips said. “Everyone has been great to me. Asking about my story. It’s inspiring and worth telling. Yet I’m just happy to meet people. It’s been one hell of a ride so far.”Natchez Democrat, July 13, 2018"

I am the Student Body President of Manual HS, Chairman of Colorado High School Democrats, Co-Founder of Champions for Denver, Chief Operations Officer for Youth for National Change, and Former Student Board of Education Member. I have participated in many public speaking engagements, where I am working with my neighbors to improve the quality of life for all. I am told that I am an inspiring speaker – an honor, I humbly, am beginning to see as a part of the true me and my future.Unfortunately, I do not have a college fund and, as much as my family would love for me to be able to attend college for free, that is not my reality. I come from a single parent household, and my wonderful, hardworking, mother, was unable to support us and, at the same time, save for higher education.My plan is to attend Metro University to become a high school history teacher in the Denver Public Schools and, to also get a better understanding of the United States political system. Eventually, I hope to become a Principal in DPS so that I can empower future generations to reach for the sky and to change the narrative. Long term, I aspire to enter the political arena, and be another Manual graduate, to become mayor of the great city of Denver. My ultimate goal is to become the first African American Governor of Colorado. All contributions help and are greatly appreciated!

The narrative follows one woman as her morning jog increasingly expands into a  massive pack of diverse women, stampeding through the city. It's unclear where and what they are running towards,  until they come to a halt at a locked door to a conference room. Exhausted but determined, they bust down the door together to reveal a group of high powered white men sitting around a table about to sign paperwork that represents the fate of women. Directed by actor & writer Zoe Travis , this video delivers the message that women will never stop fighting, even if it's down to the final hour. The content of this video is about strength in numbers and showing the voices of those that are often silenced by those in power. We feel that the funding for this project also reflects strength in numbers. Even if you are only able to contribute a small amount, by many people contributing what they can we will be able to make something that resonates with all of us. We already have an incredible publicist from Big Hassle Media  who is ready to help make sure this project gets the attention it deserves. We are continuing to add people to our team and are committed to employing a diverse cast and crew to work on this. This project is ambitious but doable. To get it done adequately and efficiently, it requires more funding than we originally had in mind. Sarah's label has already agreed to contribute to the budget, but we still need additional funding. The scale of this video is pretty large, but we cannot compromise the scale for a lesser impact. This additional budget would contribute to equipment rental, location permits, a police escort, food for cast/crew, post production costs (editing, color correction, publicity), and other production fees. It is difficult to reach out to others for money. We understand as much as anyone that money is not something that's easy to give. If you are able to contribute to this project,  we would be extremely grateful. If you can help by just passing this along to others who you think would be able to support this, that would mean the world as well.  With the completion of this video, we will send out a final budget report of where your money went and how it helped to make this project happen. We will also send out a private link to the final video before the first premiere, and if you would like, we will add your name to the end of the video credits as a donor. We are determined to complete this project, but if for any unforeseen circumstances we are unable to complete this, we will refund your donation in full. If there is any extra budget at the end of this project, however small, we will be donating that money directly to the ACLU. We are witnessing the emergence of a powerful movement, led by women, on behalf of women, and determined to seize power from the male-dominated establishment.  Launched the day after Trump’s inauguration with the Women’s March, this new political force was powered by the #MeToo movement, invigorated by the battle over Kavanaugh and is now poised to put Democrats in control of the House and perhaps the Senate.  We hope our video will add new voices to this historic moment. Thank you for taking the time to read this,  and most importantly, don't forget to VOTE ON NOVEMBER 6!"

Delegate needs help,"Created June 6, 2016","My name is Ryan Trundle and I am the only Delegate in Congressional District 4 of Louisiana for Bernie Sanders. I was elected to be the voice of this Congressional District at the National Democratic Convention by the people of 15 parishes because of my dedication to the Bernie Sanders campaign. I volunteer as a data manager for Text for Bernie every day, I have hosted a phone bank every Tuesday for more than six months, canvassed and spread the word with social media.    This will be a historic contested convention where not only will I fight without quarter for Bernie, I will also be directly involved with working for the very reform we have all been fighting for in multiple caucuses. I not only pledge my vote and loyalty to Bernie Sanders #bernieorbust, I pledge myself to you. Once at the convention I will be working with many caucuses giving us a recognized voice within the party and more influence to truly reform the Democratic Party. I am also a member of Occupy the DNC. There will be no better champion of the progressive revolution and Bernie Sanders than myself!   The Democratic party has estimated the cost of attending the convention at $4,000-6,000 for hotel cost, transportation, food, and incidentals. I am, among many other things, a single working father. While I do have a great job with decent pay this cost is, honestly, a huge hardship on my family. It's embarrassing to ask for even more from people whom I know have already given so much to Bernie and his cause, but again, I have to ask.   The hotel that the DNC has assigned us is $450 a night. There are 6 nights that I need to be there. I had originally planned on staying at a cheaper AirBNB location but have recently found out that I could lose my credentials if I did not stay at the assigned hotel for many reasons including unprecedented security measures.   After so many months of volunteering for the campaign every day for hours on end, going to fight for Bernie in the contested convention means more than I could ever express. I would truly appreciate any size donation. If you cannot donate, please share with your friends.  I can’t afford to offer rewards, which really is just buying stuff for you with your money, but anyone who donates to my campaign will have access to my private facebook group where I will post live feed videos, pictures and reactions to things that are occurring both inside and outside the convention. You have the opportunity to not only help me fight for all of us, but you can also have eyes and ears inside and outside this historic event. Please leave your facebook email address in the comments of your donations so that you can be added to the group.

We will miss her so much. Chere was a working woman and did not come from a privileged background. We are continuing to fundraise to help her family with the many outstanding medical costs from the extensive treatment she went through while fighting cancer. Original: Our friend and amazing supporter of labor, Democratic, and women's causes - Chere Chaney - was recently diagnosed with stage 4 lung and bone cancer. Chere's diagnosis is not curable, but it is treatable; she started chemo at KU the first week of February. We could write so much about why we love Chere and want to help her; she has given back so much to us. Chere has been a driving force of our political and labor community for 20+ years. She is an extremely active volunteer - for CWA, the Jackson County Democrats, democratic presidential campaigns, the Women's Political Caucus, and much more. Chere is the activist who we've always been able to count on to make calls, canvass, and get out the vote. No job has been too small for Chere; she is the person who puts her ego and personal time on the back burner and always works her tail off to help candidates and causes. She is a true servant of her community, union, and Democratic Party. Many people have sent Chere cards and flowers, but we know people want to give more to help Chere through this time. While she has health insurance, the bills to treat her cancer will add up, and she has a family she helps support as well.  While she retired from CWA, she was recently working for the Census, and we'd like to help her in any way possible because she deserves it. The money will be used to help Chere with medical costs. As many of you know, our ""political"" community is like a family, and Chere has been a mother and sister to many, so we want to give back to her now."

I appreciate this one last push. The resistance continues and we are just getting started!PLEASE READ THE UPDATE* BELOW FIRST! I'm Don St.Clair, and I have been elected to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia as a delegate for Bernie Sanders! Each of the 1900 of us Bernie delegates represents 80,000 to 100,000 voters! I am involved in creating a historic first ever Climate Change Council/Caucus at the Convention to join the more tradition identity caucuses such as Labor, LGTBQ, Latinos, AfricanAmericans, etc. I am also going to Philly to continue organizing the emerging Green Democrat (or Green Dog Democrat) wing of the Democratic Party, espousing the four key pillars of the global green movement: ecology, social justice, grassroots democracy and non-violence. For clarifications purposes: I believe that organizing a Green Dog* Democrat (*Democrat, Only Greener) within the ""Big Tent Coalition"" of the Democratic Party is the best way to bring these key values into the American political mainstream, just like the ""Realo"" pragmatist wing of the German Greens became coalition partners with the ruling Social Democrats and were able to leverage their power to implement the stunning advances in Germany of ecological sustainability, free college, etc.
*Update as of Thursday July 21st, 4 days to the convention: FRIENDS! I HAVE AN URGENT PROBLEM around cash flow. If you are about to donate to my gofundme, would you message me via the email to Don link here on GoFundMe INSTEAD? My funds are being transferred via ACH to my checking account, but they will not arrive until about Tuesday of next week! So, I am scrambling to solve the cashflow problem so I may pay for the airline ticket and other expenses that are part of the very expensive process of attending a political nominating convention. The Sanders campaign has only had limited success in fundraising for their delegates and has only paid a contribution of $377 direct to the hotel bill (splitting a room but they are super expensive). My Oregon state party, which is NOT a highflying party of fatcats in the slightest, say even being frugal, a national convention costs about $4000 to attend!(Our exemplary Senator Merkley lives in an ordinary nice suburban house and his wife still works as a nurse, and our state director is a former in the trenches community organizer out of the Howard Dean movement, not a lobbyist type, and except for a few officeholders and about five staffers, almost all of us in the Dem Party Oregon must have day jobs or other support, in my case, SSI disablity.) Yes, Democracy needs some help levelling the playing field, and that is just what Bernie has done and continues to advocate for and what we will fight for on the convention floor! So... By hook or crook I will be getting on an airplane no later than Sunday to be there for Sunday night's first delegation meeting, but I am needing to call in any and all assistance to make that happen. So please if you are able to, contact me. Thank you!  End of update, please continue with my profile I am the co-founder/director the Green Democrat Organizing Project, which is establishing several organizations similar to groups like MoveOn - a 501c3 or 4 educational membership group, an affiliated Political Action arm, and eventually a think tank policity institute for bringing the deeper global green political perspective into the mainstream of American political discourse.  We seek to unite natural allies for progressive victories - the future is and must be blue green!

I am a 27-year-old diesel mechanic and elected delegate pledged to Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic National Convention from Illinois' 17th Congressional District. As a full-time worker, husband and father of two children, I know the fiscal difficulties facing many American families like my own. I believe that Bernie Sanders understands them as well and that he has provided a strong, compassionate and data-driven plan to help rebuild a bolsterous American middle class so that we all, together, can succeed. It is for this reason, along with the rest of Bernie's campaign and platform, that I have supported his candidacy for President of the United States through monetary donations and by volunteering my time canvassing and organizing. I was recently elected by the Democrats of Illinois' Congressional District 17 to represent them at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. It is a responsibility and priviledge I do not take lightly and hope to faithfully execute during my time at the Convention. However, doing so requires a significant financial committment from me in order to attend. Hotel rooms at the Convention are over $700 a night--and I need to be there for the entire week. My wife, Tia, and I are prepared to undertake this obligation utilizing our own finances, but I believe that politics should not be limited to those who can only afford to participate. My family may be at a place where--while it may strain the budget--I can afford to represent my fellow citizens, many American families would simply not be able to attend. That is wrong, in my opinion. I believe, as Bernie Sanders does, that when we work together, we all win. We need to send a strong message to other Americans that may be interested in participating in politics, but unable to afford to do so, that we'll have their back. I am asking that you donate whatever amount you can to alleviate the cost in attending the Democratic National Convention. The money raised in this campaign will be used for airfare, hotel room reservation and dining while at the Convention. I sincerely appreciate whatever contributions you can afford and will do my best to faithfully represent the citizens of Illinois' 17th Congressional District that desire a nomination for Bernie Sanders.

You have to pressure students a lot, because the college needs to turn a profit for its share holders.    Sometimes that meant soft and not so soft harrassment techniques via emails and calls. It bothered me, but I did it.But when the exhaustion and anxiety  set in, it became very difficult to deal with for me.    A good portion of your day, you are calling delinquent students and leaving voice mails and emails too. I was tolerating it but i became to exhausted, and then sick with the flu, and I was and still am recuperating from narcissistic abuse,  and everything unraveled from there.  Im 52 years old. I thought I could recover from my exhaustion and succeed at the temporary job at the university. But I couldnt recoup my energy. I was constantly exhausted. It caused to have a cloudy mind, and the university job was the most mentally straining job I ever had in my life.I had no sick days, as a temp, I had zero physical or mental energy. My boss knew I just moved, which added extra stress, and the place I moved from was extremely stressful (i cant go into those details here. All I can say is I had no privacy and i felt like my personal boundaries were constantly being violated. My nephew Matthew lived there too, and I am not talking about him at all, me and Matt always get along just fine, always!)    Bottom line, I was a mess. I knew I was in trouble. And then I got sick with the flu. I called in sick, day 1, and day 2, day 3 i was still very sick, and i overslept my alarm and did not call in. I got a call from my temp agency asking what happened. I told them I was still sick, fever, not thinking clearly and I knew it was a mistake to talk with them when I was sick, and exhausted mentally and physically. The conversation did not go well and the job ended there. Note to self: do not talk to upset boss when you are ill and suffering from mental/physical exhaustion, the conversation will probably not end well.   I had some money in the bank. Didnt qualify for unemployment, recovered from the flu, spent the last month and a half doing job hunting and interviews.   I was in a bad situation where I didnt know if or how to tell my new roommate who is in Washington DC. I just moved in, and although he too is working a temp job and he knows how those temp jobs go, he also told me before he left that we do not have to share all of our personal business with each other and we have our rights to privacy.At the time, I agreed with him, but losing the job put me in a catch 22 situation. Tell him what happened and worry him while he is working out of town, or not tell him and lose his trust. In the end, I called him and told him what happened, and he was understanding. Awesome.   I regained my energy over the weeks, no longer exhausted, but I still suffered anxiety, I realized a big part of the anxiety was from magnesium deficiency and probably other vitamin deficiencies, and abuse recovery, and from the 3 months of 14 hour work days and commutes.  I did find an interim job. It wasnt great pay, but enough to pay my bills.  I started, and texted my roommate to let him know I got a new job and all was well.    It seemed like a good job, I vetted the company. They have a good BBB rating. They have been in business for many years. They are nice people.  The company name will remain anonymous.All I can say is on the first day of work i was eating lunch at my desk and like half of the workers were just sitting at their desks not eating. They have been there for months or years, not new employees. They were very good at what they did, and they were BROKE? I was the only new hire.  I thought that was odd. There was a meeting the next morning, its a small company, someone said since a lot of the employees cant afford to eat lunch, they brought in hot pockets if anybody wanted to eat them.   ""I can't keep loaning you guys money if you are not going to work and make your sales and your commissions to pay me back"".  that was a huge red flag for me. Pay day is every Friday, and they come in the following  Monday and Tuesday and they don't have food to eat? Hmm...  I didnt understand. This was supposed to be $10 per hour plus commission. Not great money, but its enough for bologna sanwiches and ramon noodles.   I think at that point I realized the way we got paid  was maybe not what they said it was (my opinion) and I am getting other calls for better jobs, and i am working with people who cant afford to eat meals.I couldnt do my work. I was seriously freaked out. Stay here and work and maybe not get paid what I was promised, or walk after 1 1/2 days and go to the interviews people were calling me for that week. I walked.   There are some sales jobs sales professionals should never take, and this last one is one of them. And all this happened and I am feeling healthy now, I am keeping my wits about me.   I posted this update because a friend asked me to.  If my roommate knows I have an emergency fundraising way of generating August and possibly September Rent, it would probably alleviate his concerns and he will probably let me stay. So if you can contribute something, thanks.  PS: I am applying everywhere, including corporate retail and local Independent retail stores, and banks in my neighborhood, Starbucks, potbellies, target, grocery stores, etc... Ideally, I think it is best I eventually switch professions from sales, to hospitality, banking, retail, customer service. I greatly enjoy helping people, sales jobs are not what they used to be. But I will take any job. Thanks again..Mike---------------------------------------------Hi. My name is Mike George. I am a life long liberal Christian. My family attended the First Congregationalist Church of Oak Park, Illinois, when I was a kid. It is now a United Church of Christ church. We were taught the liberal gospels of Christ.I am a life long Democrat. when I was a kid, I liked  McGovern And President Carter. I am a volunteer admin for The Christian Left. I have been so for a few years. I add commentary to posts and I ban trolls. I want to personally thank TCL members here who have helped me out with emergency donations in the past. Thank you so much. You have saved me from becoming homeless. Thank you... I also want to thank the core staff and owners of TCL organization for allowing me to ask for help. Without the assistance, I would be living on the streets, most certainly. Thank you.Here is my update. Since June of this year, I had to move out of my nice apartment due to being unemployed. For 20 years or so, I was living the middle class lifestyle for most of my adult life. I worked in inside sales, sales management, retail management and call center supervisory roles. All decent paying jobs. Not bad, considering I do not have a college degree.Since the great recession hit, it has been a big struggle for me to get my life back together, financially. My credit ratings took a hit, losing my apartment, i had to break my lease, and lately, i believe potential employers have rejected me for employment, due to my poor credit score. Personally, I admit now, that I have been too stubborn and unrealistic about my current job searching goals. I keep expecting to land a good paying, middle class job. I have had a couple of opportunities in the last 5 years, with inside sales roles, but inside sales in this bad economy are not how they used to be.I am an old fashioned type sales guy. I am 51 years old. I believe in value added sales, building professional relationships, earning trust, customer service type sales.Most sales jobs now are pretty aggressive and cut throat in nature. I cant succeed with that kind of sales approach. I have tried. It don't work. Small businesses are hurting. calling small business owners and basically haarrassing them with fear and greed tactics to make sales is not my idea of sales. I would rather get back in to retail sales and retail management, which is customer service orientated, informative, helpful, knowledgable, good honest work..And so, to survive, and get back on my feet, financially, I had to make a decision, to accept that I have to get a job soon, doing almost anything, for low pay, to earn money and get myself a cheap apartment or find a decent roommate situation, soon.Since I moved out of my apartment in June, I have been couch surfing, on the cheap, at two different places. When you sleep on someone's couch, its not exactly a great situation, but it is better than being homeless and sleeping in shelters. I have little privacy...My current living situation is not good. I can't go into details, except to say, the guy I live with is my sisters exboyfriend. They are supposed to be friends, but he is having personal difficulties dealing with that agreement that he made made with my sister. But that is his issue, so i try not to talk with him about all that.. hes a good person for taking me in. I don't hang out at his apartment. Iack lunches, I leave early morning, I go to the library for internet access and job hunt, i go out on job interviews, i go to mccdonalds for a cup of coffee when the libraries are closed, i bike ride around town to stay in shape and keep busy outside, daily. Theres no Internet where I am staying.I need to move on, very soon. I need peace of mind and personal space, like a  bedroom. I need to concentrate on job hunting, getting a job and keeping a job.And so, I am positively moving forward confidently, I will take any job I can find. Cashier, retail sales, call center phone work, bank teller, whatever I can find.I have to accept being a part of the working poor. At least temporarily, Its cool. Almost Half of all Americans are working poor, or close to being working poor. I had to swallow my pride, let go of my ego, stop holding out for a great paying job, and I will take any job I can get, except for hard physical labor work. I will probably get some kind of retail customer service job, very soon.The money I am requesting will cover my rent and bills for two months. If I can get a job in the next two weeks, I might be able to get my own place January 1st. If it takes me a little longer to get work, my move date will be February 1st.If I can get a bit more than the $800 that I am requesting, that can help me get into a new living situation sooner. The sooner, the better.I am looking forward positively, to a great 2016. I will be working soon, have a good place to live, and I have big plans, including social justice blog writing, getting back into singing and songwriting, and I want to do some volunteer work for Bernie Sanders campaign as well, and continue my political activism for social justice and the poor.Long term goals, I would like to become a liberal Christian minister. I think I could be very good at that.I am also continuing to research potential alternative living arrangements, like living in an intentional community type setting. There are numerous intentional community homes in Chicago, most of them being artists residences, and communal type spaces for like minded people. This would probably be a good step for me to take.. or else a similar multi roommate arrangement in a house or large apartment.Lastly, thank you so much for your help. I have complete faith in God that everything is going to work out for the best. I have relied on my faith to get me through tough times. I believe Jesus is my friend, and he is your friend, and he looks out for us. If you have different beliefs, or no spiritual beliefs, I respect that..If you can help me, thank you so much! If you cannot, no worries.I only ask for help because I am desperate, and I need to survive, and not become homeless.I talk with homeless guys that I meet at the library and at McDonalds. Once one becomes homeless, it is bad. I have helped out homeless people in the past, when I had extra money. I want to make it clear that I do not have any substance  abuse addictions, or psychological or physical issues that are preventing me from working. I am healthy. I am a light social drinker.I am 51 years old. I see dozens of people my age job searching at the library. Its hard to get hired for middle aged folks because younger people in their 20s and 30s are getting hired, and us middle aged people have to really struggle to get a job.My tea bagger governor, has refused to sign a state budget into law since August.  This has seriously hurt the Illinois economy. You can do internet searches and read stories about this, for more information.. job growth in Illinois has slowed down to a  snails pace since August, thanks  to our tea bagger republican governor..I am reworking my resume so it is more aligned for retail sales jobs, and cashier type lower pay menial jobs. If I can get an entry level retail job, maybe I can get promoted to assistant manager. I enjoy working retail. I am applying online as well as visiting retai stores in person, to meet with store managers and to apply in person, hand them my retail sales resume and try and get hired on the spot.Thanks again! Happy holidays to you and your families. God bless.Mike GeorgeIf you can help me, thank you. If you cannot, no worries."

His VA rep has been in contact and is trying to find ways to help. Several local groups have come to his familie's aid with food and necessities (Much Appreciated). We have tried to work with a good number of veterans groups only to find that a large number will not help someone who served prior to 9-11. Others appear to just be shams who are self serving. The result is that we are making very slow progress in helping the Umphrey family. He is still in desperate need for some type of dependable transportation. This will also necessitate insurance and maintenance cost.Please help us to help Roland and his family.  Any amount will be greatly appreciated.                        "

By age 17, over half of youth in foster care have experienced an arrest, conviction, or overnight stay in a correctional facility.

Together we have advocated for them to have the opportunity to share their experiences in the form of a documentary short, which will closely examine the relationship between Jane Crow (foster care system) and Jim Crow (prison system and mass incarceration), also referred to as the foster-care-to-prison pipeline. Our expectation is that this film will serve as a useful educational tool for attorneys, social workers, child advocates, students and elected officials, for whom it is important to understand the impact of CPS involvement on the lives of children and families if we are to enact meaningful systemic change.

This past week, I was elected to attend the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia as a Washington state pledged delegate for Bernie Sanders!  I will be representing thousands of Democratic voters from Anacortes' 217th Precinct, Skagit County, Washington's 40th Legislative District, 2nd Congressional District and the state itself.This trip is not inexpensive. Between flight, hotel and food, I placed the fundraising goal at my estimate. As I am writing this, the surrealism of the whole experience is cooling off and being replaced by the reality of the coming steps.With 4 children at home, my wife and I can attest that financially supporting our family on non-profit incomes can be very interesting. Our finances are constantly focused on family and the cost of this event is a definite challenge.If you would like to read my personal goals, they are written below!  If not, you can totally donate and move along!  :)If you can help me move forward toward this incredible opportunity, I will be forever in your debt.From the bottom of my heart, I love you all!TimIn addition to supporting the platform of Bernie Sanders and that of our county and state, the platform of personal ideals I will be representing to the convention is one of seemingly unique value in this election cycle.I am a practical idealist.  While seeming to be a contradicton, I find this standpoint to be far more successful than the two separate from each other.  That the one cannot thrive for long without the other.  Change is incremental, but long-term successful progress in our government relies entirely on public trust in a system of ideals.  That trust is won or lost in the honest integrity of our ideals and how we drive our own conversation.  Both parties have lost that trust; each entirely due to their own lack of consistency, logic and ethical leadership.  Idealism can be beautiful, but without togetherness, thoughtful compromise and simple organization, those ideals will never come to pass.  Having this versatility allows me to connect and communicate effectively with people of all types.   Our modern failures as a nation are built upon our inability to identify and elect great leaders at all levels of government.  We fail to continue the conversation, as well as create accountability for our leaders.  Americans continue to elect and re-elect leadership that cannot properly execute simple actions we expect of our children.  To elect leaders who lack basic skills in public speaking.  Both parties absolve their own guilt by placing blame entirely on others' shoulders.  We consciously flounder in the idea that extremism and hate must be met with extremism and hate.  That people don't change their minds and there's nothing that can be done.  We must all move to stem the tide of this extremism.  People do change.  But only if the one with the microphone possesses the ability to get them to listen.  That ability starts with identifying common ground.  It is then continued by a gift for public speaking.  You must be heard by a crowd.I aim to steer (pun intended!) the ship back toward intellectual conversation.  To remind us that true strength lies in the ability to identify and correct faults.My goal is to aid in achieving a shift in national leadership in regards to the presentation of Democratic Party ideals and priorities.  I have faith that this (unrealistic and naive, yet noble and necessary) goal relies on the delivery of the proper message.  I have a very loud and clear voice with a long list of messages.  For the sake of this call for support, some of my simplified priorities include, but are definitely not limited to: 1.  Leadership must demonstrate integrity, courage, logic and compassion.  We must replace those without.2.  Self-correction within the party before blame for others.  Every group.3.  Unity among all Americans rather than simply within our own self-made communities.4.  Educate America.  Intelligent citizenship is acheived through intelligent leadership.  The opposite is equally true.  We must discover an ethical approach to holding our media and leadership accountable for the delivery of deliberate misinformation.  5.  Critical analysis of all government programs.  Stubborn insistence on the continuation of failure is lunacy.  If the system is not achieving the desired results, we must start over. 6.  Purposeful elimination of systems and leaders inspiring apathy and disenfranchisement.  The future of our country relies entirely, for better or worse, on the involvement of the American people. 7.  Fighting against the extreme ageism persisting in our current party system.  Current leadership must invest in the future generations of this country.  8.  Mobilizing inspired Americans and building trust in the party through increasing party organization and accountability. 9.  Supporting our platform through honest persuasion, logical discussion and inspiration rather than through dishonest political maneuvering, division and fear mongering.  10.  Achieving long-term sustainable solutions that represent a brighter future for all Americans rather than inconsistent and unsustainable legislation that builds and bloats on itself.I believe these ideals can be shared by ALL Americans;  Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike.  Whether or not you believe these things are already priorities, we can all see the massive disinterest in the civic duty of voting. That is born through a lack of faith in both parties. Our country cannot be strong if there is no faith in leadership. This party has lost the ability to communicate effectively.  We can all see a glaring lack of ""good fruit"" coming through.We must resume the conversation through a focus on common ground rather than a focus on the elements that divide us.  When our leadership is wrong, accountability must be prioritized on all sides.For a message to create positive change, volume is secondary to saying what is worth hearing.If I listed any idea you would like to continue a conversation on, I would love to discuss over a good drink.If I forgot to mention any important ideas, ditto.If you would like to edit my rantings and ravings, shoot me a message.  :)"

He’s 4th generation to the township on his father’s side of the family and 3rd generation on his mother’s side of the family. He attended local elementary schools in Whitehouse Station and Readington and is a 1994 graduate of Hunterdon Central High School.Trevor’s local roots are deep. His paternal Great-Grandfather, Petro Izzo, immigrated to the Township in the early 1800’s and his maternal grandfather, Ed Brown, moved to Whitehouse Station in the late 1920’s. Ed and his brother Francie owned the former Union Hotel on Main St. (now the Rail). After serving during World War 2, like many veterans, he became active in developing the community. He was a founding member of Whitehouse Fire Department, the Whitehouse Little League and Whitehouse Athletic Association. Ed’s youngest brother, Jim, along with Robert Ingram, were the first two casualties of WW2 from Whitehouse Station and were honored by naming the large ballfield on James St. after them: Brown-Ingram Memorial Field. Trevor’s father, Jim Izzo, is a Vietnam veteran, a current resident and retired public servant (Readington Twp. Police Dept) to the community for over 40 years and retired at the rank of detective sergeant first class. Working locally since high school, Trevor found his niche in the heating and cooling trade. He started as an apprentice and worked his way up to top sales engineer with a local H.V.A.C company. Realizing he wanted more Trevor decided to venture out on his own. His hard work and perseverance resulted in developing a successful local business, Garden State Energy. Trevor also recently accepted a position as an HVAC Instructor at Hunterdon County Polytech adding to his resume of community involvement. Trevor is running (as a independent moderate and honestly a little more right then left) against Betty Ann Fort (current Mayor/Republican) and Denise Esakoff (Democrat)Due to recent events that have and will continue to change the landscape of Readington Township, Trevor wants to make a contribution by running for Township Committee. Electing Trevor will help secure positive outcomes regarding these changes.Trevor believes that both current and past council members have wasted the township taxpayer money. With excessive spending, legal fees such as the contentious airport lawsuits. Being a lifelong resident, Trevor understands the concerns of an expanded Solberg Airport. But he also values the rights of a business that has been operating for seventy years. With that perspective, he believes the township and the airport can and will come to a conclusion that is beneficial to all parties.Its time these current members stop rotating seat with all their friends to stay in control… that’s the problem with politicians they make careers out of this Trevor’s goals include:- Create an effective affordable housing strategy.- Evaluate the current process of how the open space acquisitions are implemented.- Develop a comprehensive plan to attract more businesses to the area to offset residential property taxes.Please vote for Trevor Izzo on November 5th 2019 for Readington Twp. committeeThis message was brought to you by, Your Readington voice"

For years I was interested in politics, but never saw myself involved in it as it felt far too much like an old boys club where experience like mine would never be valued. I love volunteering within the local community, but joining the Social Democrats gave me even more insight into how we could use empathetic politics to make a difference for people.

Ireland's political landscape has changed so much in the last 5 years, yet our political representatives have not had the same progress. A whole new generation has woken up to political engagement through the Marriage Equality and the Repeal campaigns. Grassroots activism was key in these changes - and we are ready to tackle even more injustices such as housing rights and climate action.  I firmly believe that these same grassroots hold the power to changing local politics for the better.

Election politics were never part of the roadmap I envisioned myself on, but I believe having more progressive and diverse voices in politics could help change Ireland for the better - this is why I put myself forward to stand for Galway City Council.

What do you need these funds for?Running an election campaign, even at a local level, is a costly affair.

Cost is a huge barrier to so many people entering the political ring in the first place - which is why I'm asking for your help. We are a young party without the 'war chests' you see with other larger parties. I self-funded my first batch of canvass cards, and paid for my first batch of leaflets from donations through friends and 2 local fundraisers (thank you thank you thank you to all who helped with these so far) - but the costs are mounting up.

I need to fund election literature and posters to give myself a fighting chance. I want to cover costs that any of my campaign team put into getting involved as far as I can afford, such as petrol and travel costs, and keeping people fed. I would also like to use some of this amount for social media advertising and an ad or two in the local paper, to build recognition of the campaign across Galway City.

This is why I'm asking for €1,000 as this will help cover these campaign needs. Any additional funds (if any!) would be funnelled towards increasing the visibility of my campaign and to help cover volunteer costs.Anything else we need to know?

I'll be finalising all of my orders for election materials in the next few weeks, so every single euro will be put towards helping me get my campaign out there. Even with being a first-time candidate with a new party, I truly believe I have a fighting chance of taking a seat in Galway City Council and bringing some fresh representation to the city. I have been getting a great reception at the doors while canvassing, so additional materials would really be the game-changer in this.

Your help and support could help make the difference in me getting a seat so please donate if you can!

If you can't afford to donate, here are a few other ways you can help:

- Please share this GoFundMe with your friends and family. Anyone based in Ireland, or an Irish citizen aboard, can donate.- Consider volunteering a few hours of your time to my campaign. We'll need leafleters, canvassers, cheerleaders, admin help, and hand-holders galore over the next number of weeks. Email sharon.nolan[@]socialdemocrats.ie if you're interested in helping out.- Follow my Facebook , Twitter and Instagram for lots of campaign updates.

Your support is crucial in turning these dreams into a reality. Let's do this together!Thank you for your time <3

That's right there are no roads to where I live, and it's a long long way to Philadelphia!I need assistance to cover the costs of participating in the convention. The room alone is estimated to cost 2,400.00+ not including the 1,500.00+ airfare. There is literally no one in the country who has to travel farther than me to participate, so I plan on making the most of the convention on your behalf! We need A positive change in this country and Bernie is the guy to bring it with our help.A little about me: I'm a certified teacher, a former principal, I was 2nd Chief of my Tribe for 7 years, I am married to a wonderful wife who supports my passion for politics and our four children think I am ""funny"".

I am so grateful for that incredible gift. I wish there were words to express how deeply thankful I am. I hope my actions, now and through the convention, demonstrate it. I am going to leave my campaign open so that I can share pictures and videos from the convention with all of my amazing donors, but I am NOT fundraising through it (although I am still hosting an already-scheduled local garage sale fundraiser). I will share updates with everyone during and/or after the convention and I will mail #PostCardsFromPhilly while I am on the ground during the #DNC2016. Thank you again for helping me meet my fundraising needs to to be a National Bernie Sanders Delegate. It's an honor and I am humbled. #SeeYouInPhilly #NotMeUsUPDATE: I'll be sending #PostcardsFromPhilly to every donor who donates $10 or more! Your postcard will come from this historic convention and will be mailed on the ground during the action. I'll contact you for mailing details. Thank you and I appreciate every single vacuum penny. #SeeYouInPhilly! Hello fellow Berners! My name is Elizabeth Wilke and I am honored to have been elected as a pledged delegate for Bernie Sanders from Illinois' 11th Congressional district to the Democratic National Convention. I've admired and followed Bernie for a decade, since my favorite poly sci professor introduced me to him, but I became involved in the campaign a year ago. I have spent hundreds of hours (maybe more?) canvassing, phonebanking, traveling across 3 states to volunteer including Iowa to GOTV, fundraising, attending Bernie meetings, volunteering at Bernie events in Illinois and Iowa, and currently working to organize the Illinois Bernie delegation as well as work with other Bernie national delegates across the country so we're united and strong at the convention! Bernie also inspired me to run for precinct committeewoman as well as a board position in my local Democratic Party, both of which I won. I also helped to slate a Berniecrat so she could get on the ballot for a State Rep race. Like Bernie says, change comes from the bottom up and this revolution  won't be televised! I care very deeply about improving the future of our country and I can't wait to cast my delegate vote on behalf of over 30,000 Illinois voters who sent me to this convention and deserve the bright and secure future Bernie’s policies offer.But I can’t do it without your help. The Democratic Party projects each pledged delegate will need around $5,000 to attend the convention. However, I don’t anticipate needing to raise that in its entirety. I've been saving up every extra vacuum penny to fund this and I'm sharing the hotel room and transportation (where possible), so I should only need a boost of about $3,000. That will help me cover the room at $726.50 per night for 5 nights, a meal allowance and travel to and from the Wells Fargo Center which is six miles from the required hotel the Party had us book into. If there are any excess funds after my expenses are finalized, they will be donated 100 percent to down-ticket progressive Democrats and Berniecrats to help them win their elections.I'm a married mother of three awesome children: one teenage son and two young daughters. I was a teenage mother who worked full time for $5.25 an hour while attending college full-time and I'm still in student loan debt.  That's not the future I want for my children.  It is indeed time for a political revolution and that cannot be accomplished from the sidelines. The changes Bernie is calling for will benefit ALL of us. Not just some of us. So please, if you're able, send me a donation and help me fight for Bernie. My voice is loud, my heart is strong, and my conviction steadfast. No donation is too small and I'm grateful for $3 or $5 or any amount. #StillSanders #SeeYouInPhilly #NotMeUs"

My Story:Like many of you, I consider voting in this upcoming midterm election one of the most important commitments on my to-do list. So I made it a priority to request my absentee ballot well before the application deadline. Last week, I was horrified to learn that I was in danger of being disenfranchised. Despite sending in my application well ahead of the deadline, I did not receive my absentee ballot in time for my vote to count. When I called the County Board of Elections to check on my ballot last week, they told me they didn’t even know if they’d received my application—they were so backed up that they had piles of unopened applications waiting to be processed. They couldn’t tell me when they’d get to it. They said my ballot might not go out in the mail until two days before it had to be back in their office, completed (meaning I wouldn't even receive it before it had to be back, because I am out-of-state right now, and would be through Election Day—which is why I needed an absentee ballot!).After learning this, I spent hours calling every office and department I could think of, trying to figure out if there was any way I could get my ballot in time to vote. I was told I could not request an emergency absentee ballot (a process that would require me to overnight a notarized application to a friend, who would need to take time from work to go get the ballot for me and overnight it to me, so that I could overnight it back to the office), because I had already sent in an application for a regular one (even though they didn’t know if they had received it). I was told that ""unfortunately,"" many people will probably not get their ballots in time, and many ballots won’t be counted because the voters won’t receive them in time to return them by the deadline (which was YESTERDAY in my state). Because the deadline is for ballots to be received—not postmarked—many voters won’t even know that their votes didn’t count, because they won’t be sure of when they were delivered.  [http://www2.philly.com/philly/news/politics/pennsylvania-absentee-ballot-voting-deadline-missed-uncounted-20180808.html]I tried to imagine how I’d feel on Election Day and afterwards if I couldn’t vote, and I just cannot bear the idea of not voting in this election. So I am reconfiguring my work and travel schedule and flying back to Philadelphia to cast my vote on November 6. I’m upending my schedule and getting on a plane for two reasons: I want my vote counted, and I want to raise awareness and money to eradicate this problem.I am not raising money for my flight and other transportation costs—I am paying for those myself. Instead, I want to raise at least 10x my financial investment in this election for an organization that is trying to make sure that someday, all eligible voters in our country can easily get their ballots, cast their votes, and have them counted—without any guesswork involved.This is not about me. This is about ALL Americans who rely on the integrity of our democratic process. I am one of so many voters who are unexpectedly disenfranchised this year, and most of them don’t have the option, due to lack of financial ability, physical ability, or time control and work hours flexibility, to reconfigure everything and get on a plane, to miss work, to do whatever they would need to do in order to get to the polls. Countless midterm election ballots will not be counted or will never even be cast. That affects ALL of us. Democrat, Republican, Green, Libertarian, Independent—every citizen is impacted by this.  There’s good news here: there is a wonderful NON-PARTISAN organization that is working hard to solve this problem on a national level: The National Vote at Home Institute.The National Vote at Home Institute (""NV@HI”) exists to remove barriers to voter participation by encouraging the widespread adoption of Vote at Home (""V@H"") friendly practices, policies, and laws for all U.S. elections. Those practices can range from full V@H status (see below) to improvements in the availability of no excuse absentee ballots, to simple removal of difficult absentee ballot return policies. All are aimed at increasing voter engagement in our democracy. I have no affiliation with this organization; I am just an individual voter who wants to support the great work they’re doing. I had the pleasure of meeting with NV@HI’s Executive Director Amber McReynolds this week. I was struck by her commitment, compassion, and achievements in making voting accessible for all voters. She is unaffiliated and firmly approaches this work with a non-partisan perspective.The data shows that Vote at Home increases voter engagement, has lower costs, and is more secure. Here’s a link to lots of data: https://www.voteathome.org/data-centerWhen the NV@HI's mission is achieved, situations like mine will no longer exist. I’m angry that I did everything I was told according to the policies, and I didn’t receive my ballot in time. Of course, I’m also kicking myself, feeling guilty, wishing I'd had the foresight to know this might happen, and request my ballot even earlier. But as the folks at NV@HI say, ""it should not be the obligation of citizens to somehow “connect” with their ballot – either by physically traipsing to a government-designated polling place on a given day or days, or pre-arranging for an absentee ballot. Rather, it should be the obligation of our elected officials in government – who work for us – to provide citizens with our ballots, and make it as easy as possible, for as many of us as possible, to vote and then return those ballots to wield our judgments as to who should govern us.”   The Ask:I’m asking you to do three things:1. Share this with everyone you know who is voting, or who is unable to vote. (The sooner the better, so more people can participate on Election Day.) 2. In your “I voted” selfie (you know you’re taking one anyway!), hold a piece of paper with a message about someone or a group of people who couldn’t vote.  Or, if you already voted or can't vote, take a photo with just a sign. Add the sentence ""Support Vote @ Home for ____ (your state)"" or ""Support Vote @ Home in every state"" or ""Support the National Vote @ Home Institute."" Use the hashtags #voteathome #votebymail #helpeveryonevote #makevotingeasy When you post your photo on social media with a link to the fundraiser, you’ll help spread awareness about this important issue.   Examples:    

•  If you were able to vote: “I voted…but my _________ (friend/brother/mother/etc.) couldn’t because _____________ (ex. she/he/they didn’t receive her/his/their absentee ballot in time). Or—""“I voted…but many eligible voters were disenfranchised today because they couldn’t make it to the polls.” •  If you couldn’t vote: “I couldn’t vote today because _____________ (ex. I couldn’t afford to take the time off work).""•  If you live in a state that already has no-excuse vote by mail for all voters: ""I voted by mail and _______(something about the difference this made for you).""•  Anyone: ""Vote at Home increases voter engagement, has lower costs, and is more secure.""3. Donate $10 to this fundraiser in honor of someone who couldn’t vote. ***IMPORTANT!!!***NV@HI is a 501(c)(3) organization that is currently awaiting determination from the I.R.S for its tax-exempt status. This means a couple of things:1. Your donation is not tax-deductible.2. My only option was to set this up as a personal fundraiser, which means that I will need to personally withdraw the funds and donate them to NV@HI. In making a donation, you are trusting me to do that on my honor. I pledge to donate every penny you give, minus GoFundMe's transaction rate for contributions to personal causes, which is a 2.9% and $0.30 credit card processing fee.Donating to this fundraiser is a way for you to increase your impact this Election Day, whether or not your candidates win. Voting is a RIGHT, not a privilege. Help make sure every person can easily access that right. Please, join me in helping everyone vote. *****************************************************************************About the National Vote at Home Institute [from their website, https://www.voteathome.org]The National Vote at Home Institute (NV@HI) is a 501(c)(3), created to remove barriers to voter participation by encouraging the widespread adoption of Vote at Home (""V@H"") friendly practices, policies, and laws for all U.S. elections. Those practices can range from full V@H status (see below) to improvements in the availability of no excuse absentee ballots, to simple removal of difficult absentee ballot return policies. All are aimed at increasing voter engagement in our democracy.  It also has a sister organization, the National Vote at Home Coalition, which is a 501(c)(4).The founder of the Institute is Board Chair Phil Keisling, former Secretary of State of Oregon, who oversaw the first rollout of a 100% V@H state for the 2000 elections.  He is uniquely qualified to lead this effort, having witnessed first hand the benefits over a prolonged period of time. He is joined by a team headed by Executive Director Amber McReynolds, who led the Denver elections department for seven years and has been widely acknowledged as perhaps THE leading expert on ballot delivery election systems in the country. To our knowledge, NV@HI is the only such organization led at both the Board and Operating level by former elections officials.The organization is also fortunate to have a wide cross-section of current and former legislators and elections officials, voting rights organizations and community activists serving as informal advisors.  A more formal Advisory Committee is being formed and will be announced shortly.The primary goal of the NV@HI is the adoption by state and local governments of a Vote @ Home System (also known as universal vote by mail). Under a true Vote @ Home system – which today exists in the three states of Oregon, Colorado, and Washington, 27 of Utah’s 29 counties, 31 of North Dakota's 53 counties, five of California's counties plus other jurisdictions across the country – ballots are mailed via the U.S. Postal Service to every active registered voter for all elections, including primary, midterm, and presidential contests. Voters can then return their completed ballots by return postage or by taking them to any one of many convenient ballot drop-sites, vote centers and other official election locations.IT IS ALREADY WORKINGIn 2016, 33 million Americans cast ballots that were mailed to them – roughly 25% of all votes that year. About 22 million of those votes came via traditional absentee ballots, and another 11 million were cast by voters living in “Vote @ Home” states and counties. By the 2022 midterms, the goal of the NV@HI is that more than 100 million voters will be receiving their ballots in this manner and that a dozen states or more have majority “Vote @ Home” election systems.At its essence, the Vote @ Home movement is “grassroots” politics at its most elemental level – literally focused on most citizens’ kitchen or dining room tables, around which they can possess and wield the single most powerful tool in our democratic system.Vote @ Home is the single best way to induce more voters to exercise their franchise. A fundamental premise of the Vote at Home movement is that it should not be the obligation of citizens to somehow “connect” with their ballot – either by physically traipsing to a government-designated polling place on a given day or days, or pre-arranging for an absentee ballot. Rather, it should be the obligation of our elected officials in government – who work for us – to provide citizens with our ballots, and make it as easy as possible, for as many of us as possible, to vote and then return those ballots to wield our judgments as to who should govern us. The idea is simple: instead of having to go to a designated polling place, every voter receives a ballot in the mail. Unlike traditional absentee ballots, voters will automatically receive their ballot without having to affirmatively request and legally qualify for one. Voters would then have several weeks to fill out their ballot and could choose to either mail it back or drop it off at any of a number of secure drop-off sites—places like fire stations, schools, and libraries.SAFE AND SECURETo ensure election integrity, election officials then match signatures on the return ballot envelopes against those on voters’ registration cards. Since 2000, more than 100 million mailed-out ballots have been cast in the nation’s Vote at Home states and counties, and a quarter of a BILLION ballots cast, if one adds absentee voters across the country, without a whiff of serious mischief.Regardless of whether we passionately agree – or fiercely oppose – the given policies and actions of our elected officials, isn’t our democracy healthier in direct proportion to the share of our citizens who have participated in elections that brought those policies and actions about?Nothing is as fundamental – or as foundational – to the success of our country, as ensuring that when elections happen, as many voters as possible can and do participate.*****************************************************************************Some Great Alternatives:If you don’t want to support this fundraiser, please consider donating to one of these other organizations to support their efforts at preventing disenfranchisement:https://www.voteriders.org (VoteRiders is a national nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that provides practical assistance and information to ensure voters have the right kind of ID to vote in their state.

The more absolute the hush, the more shocking the thunderclap. Our masters have not heard the people’s voice for generations, Evey, and it is much, much louder than they care to remember."" — from V for VendettaLike me, you’re watching the most stomach-turning election campaign in our history unfold and wondering what to do about it other than start drinking the minute you get out of bed and swallow a fistful of illegal painkillers. Sure, we all know Hillary Clinton heads one of the most corrupt political families in American history but what are you going to do? Vote for Donald Trump, a narcissistic lunatic who is stirring up genuinely frightened working and middle class people but along with a terrifying Brownshirt element as well?Meanwhile, the state of journalism has never been worse. There are a few scattered reporters doing great work, but the vast majority are in the tank for one party or the other and employed by plodding, dishonest media conglomerates controlled by the very same Wall Street and tech billionaires who effectively run our political system. Even journalists who want to take on the biggest, fattest targets often can’t do so because they work for them or their friends or relatives.Like me, you’re also tired of reading political drivel and propaganda that makes Pravda under Stalin look honest in comparison. Would you prefer something written to high reporting standards but that treats politicians, the media and the entire political class with total contempt? How fun would it be to have a vicious online tabloid that mixes highbrow political investigations with the sleaziest (but truest) Washington political gossip? That’s where WashingtonBabylon.com, my soon-to-launch political and gossip website, comes in. I’m going to cover DC politicians and journalists like Hollywood celebrities --  not the way they are worshiped by our current media masters, but the way they were mocked and exposed by the great Hollywood tabloid Confidential and by Kenneth Anger in his wonderful, lurid book Hollywood Babylon.I’m a long-time investigative journalist who has been fired repeatedly due to clashes with management and editors. I’m currently an incredibly underpaid contributing writer for VICE and columnist for the New York Observer. I’m based in Washington — the very best place to dredge up bullshit because it’s the city’s chief manufactured product. You want stories about Bill Clinton shacking up with two blondes at a luxury DC hotel? Coming right up. You want to know how deeply Hillary Clinton has been penetrated by Wall Street? I’m on it. You’re wondering if Donald Trump has his brain up his ass or if he doesn’t have one at all? I can answer that question. A Democrat with a coke problem? A Republican family values man whoring around town? Trust me, these things are happening right now and I will have the details.And sure, I love this sort of high brow gossip as much as anyone but I’m also a serious writer with a long track record of success. My stories have landed people in prison, launched U.S. congressional investigations, led to FBI raids, and brought down one of the most “prestigious” banks in Washington — Riggs, which was laundering money for various foreign dictators and members of the Washington elite.I’ve been writing these sort of tales non-stop since 1993, when I founded the muckraking newsletter CounterPunch (Motto: “Tells the facts and names the names”) and the following year was joined by the legendary writer Alexander Cockburn. In 1812, his great-grandfather, the British rear admiral George Cockburn, burned Washington to the ground. And that’s my chief goal now with WashingtonBabylon.com.I left CounterPunch in 1999 and since then I’ve written for countless magazines and newspapers. I’ve worked on staff as an investigative reporter with the Los Angeles Times' Washington office and as the DC correspondent for Harper’s magazine. I’ve also written a number of books, including The Radioactive Boy Scout and The Secret World of Oil.During my career I've written more than 1,000 stories. I uncovered a right-wing German arms dealer who supplied the CIA with weapons for its covert operations for 40 years; I exposed the son of the dictator of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars in looted money in the United States; and I’ve repeatedly revealed how intelligence agencies have used “honeypots” to recruit assets. I’m working on a number of big stories for WashingtonBabylon.com, most of them about this godawful presidential campaign but also a new tale of sex and espionage and an inside account of two especially shitty “journalism” outfits.As a journalist I am loyal to no one but my readers, which is why I attack all sides, right, center and left. But I'm a writer, not an activist. I pursue great stories even if they're about a person or a cause I admire, though it’s always more fun to go after the world’s dirtiest politicians and mobsters. As you can imagine, REAL journalistic independence comes at a cost in this country. I’ve made a lot of enemies and burned a lot of bridges. Last year I resigned from a cushy job at The Intercept and wrote about that disaster in an article titled “Where Journalism Goes to Die.” I could have improved my financial situation recently by taking $12,500 from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to help him cover up his cousin’s murder of a 15-year-old girl, but instead I told him to fuck himself and wrote a column about it in the New York Observer.

It is a terrific visibility opportunity to let the community know that there are like-minded neighbors in our area and that they are not alone in supporting Democratic candidates and policies. The parade is always tremendous fun for those that choose to walk with us and we’ve gotten a great reception every year.This year, the parade organizers have changed the rules and now require political parties to become Bronze level sponsors in order to participate. Because we are a non-profit with very little available funds, we must raise money to enter the parade this year. While we wish we could enter the parade for free, we believe the Bronze level sponsorship will offer us even greater visibility with sponsor-level benefits.Last fall, we were able to flip our House, Senate, and Congressional district seats thanks in part to the visibility of the Dekalb Democrats. Please contribute to the cause to send us back to the Dunwoody July 4th Parade so that we can keep our community blue.* Every little bit will help!THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!*All money raised above our goal will be donated to the Dekalb Dems general fund to increase Democratic voter turnout in Dekalb."

Throughout their 35-year marriage, David and Adrianne shared their warmth and generosity with a very loving and tight-knit family structure, with their friends, and to countless members of our community. While many of us are still trying to process this enormous loss, the family that they leave behind have been given the impossible task of not only coping with this tragedy, but with managing David and Adrianne's financial assets and obligations. Many of these financial obligations will fall on David and Adrianne's son Zack, and his wife Violet. I feel that I can speak for all of us who love Zack and Violet in saying that the last thing that any of us want is for them to be spending the next several years working to offset the tremendous financial burden that this situation has presented. I would like to take this time to turn to our community to see if we can come together to assist them in any way financially; to help alleviate some of the cost that they are faced with, while allowing them some time to grieve.Press Democrat Article About Their Passing "

Our friend and fellow activist, Terri Niles, has dedicated countless hours over the past several years organizing, advocating and otherwise working her tail off to have a positive impact on the community in Clark County. As a PCO for the CCDCC, and former Co-Chair of the Outreach Commitee, Terri has registered dozens of voters, knocked on hundreds of doors, and executed countless events all aimed at improving the lives of everyone. She was even awarded PCO of the Year in 2018 by the Clark County Democrats. Terri has stood in the face of adversity and even when personally attacked by right wing extremists, she continues to show up and put in the work. She continues to volunteer as President of the Clark County Democratic Women and Secretary for the 17th LD, in addition to her work for the Nurses Union at OHSU (oh yeah, and did I mention shes a Trauma Nurse in her spare time?) This time though, she has fallen victim to an individual who claims to be on her own team. A Civil Case was brought against Terri in Clark County District Court for ""harassment"" by a fellow 'party member'. The case is outrageous, and if you're reading this far you probably already know more details than you wish you did. But here's the bottom line: We are confident that Terri will come out victorious in this suit, but unfortunately not without the cost of attorney's fees. In the first hearing this week, the Plaintiff spent the entire session reading from a 130 page document and causing a second hearing to commence next month. Terri will have her chance to respond then, but again... another hearing = additional billable hours for the attorney and so on. So please, join with me to stand side-by-side with Terri Niles and support her however we can. Thanks!

Keith, who ran into the burning house in an attempt to save his brother, lost everything that day.Any amount is greatly appreciated, not only because it supports him in rebuilding his life, but because it sends a message – YOU ARE NOT ALONE, KEITH.Keith's Story:Keith Harris spent 22 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, until he was finally released and exonerated. Wrongly convicted at 19-years-old, he left prison at 42, and was issued an innocence  pardon by the Governor.  His conviction was based on an “eye-witness” who was shown 7 lineups with Keith in them before finally selecting Keith – and the real perpetrator confessed to Keith’s “crime” the year he was convicted, but that was not disclosed until 2 decades later.Keith was supported throughout his wrongful imprisonment by his identical twin brother and best friend, Kenny.  Then, the tables turned and it was Kenny who needed Keith’s help when Kenny suffered a stroke and required full-time care.Keith picked up his life and moved into Kenny’s house so that Kenny would not have to be put into a facility. Keith then took on the full-time care of his twin brother.  Keith and Kenny lived together, catching up on lost time.  A couple of years ago, Keith too suffered a minor stroke, but was still able to live with and care for his brother.Then, tragedy struck Keith and Kenny’s life again.  On February 4, 2016, a fire started in Kenny’s bedroom.  Kenny, confined to a wheelchair, was unable to make it out of the house alive.  Keith, always loyal to his brother, tried to run into the fire to save his brother who was trapped.  Keith suffered burns and a neighbor who witnessed it told a reporter: “[Keith] even went back into that burning house to try to get him out. That house was engulfed in flames. He loved his brother as he should have. I commend him for what he tried to do.”  - Belleville News Democrat article (click for link).Losing his twin brother in this way is unthinkable.  It is the latest in a long line of injustices for Keith. Yet he remains one of the most faithful, loyal, loving and kind people we have ever known.  Aside from the loss of Kenny, their entire home burned down and Keith lost EVERYTHING.  He is left with no clothing, no furniture, no appliances, and all of his sentimental mementos and photographs are gone. Keith was the first exoneree helped by the Illinois Innocence Project, a non-profit legal group that works to free the innocent from prison. Over the years, Keith has always volunteered to give back and help.  Now, it is our time to help Keith.We hope to raise money to help Keith get back on his feet.  The State of Illinois failed him in 1979 when he was wrongly convicted and imprisoned for 22 years.  His brother and he were both dealt difficult medical cards, suffering strokes at a young age.  Most people would lose their faith in everything.  But, Keith has maintained his faith in his religion and in humanity – and he deserves for us to pull together as a community and help him now.No amount is too small. Every penny will go directly to Keith, who has to replace everything he owned.  We thank you so much for joining us to send Keith the powerful message that he is NOT ALONE! For more on Keith’s case, see his case profile on theIllinois Innocence Project website (click here for link) Also, see detailed information about his case and exoneration on the National Registry of Exonerations website (click here for link) Learn more about the tragic fire in the news article (click here for link) "

My name is Christian Ucles and I'm the Conventions Director for the Iowa Democratic Party. Over the next 2 months we will get a chance to work together at the National Convention. This email will be long so bear with me!Once you read this email please fill this form to update all your contact information and to leave any questions and comments.HOTELSA decision was made to participate in the DNCC hotel reservation block, in which there will be a number of hotel rooms that will be blocked off for the Iowa delegation. These rooms won't be available to book until our delegation is certified by the DNCC ( You are all certified but not our complete slate) which won't happen until the week of June 20th when we select the 22 other delegates at the State convention. The reasoning for this is because of Philadelphia is a massive city and it would be beneficial if the Iowa delegation was in one spot at all times.The current cost for the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown is $569-$629 a day or a total $3,500-$4,500 for a 5-6 day stay. The convention is scheduled to start on Monday, July 25th through Thursday, July 29th. I highly encourage that some of you find a delegate and work together to split the cost. I've created a google document so you can request that information and we could create a match-making process to find roommates for each other. By the way current booking for that hotel is at $791 a night during Convention week (according to Kayak.com).so we are getting a discount of nearly $200 per night.If you decide to not stay at the Marriott Hotel in Philadelphia, I'd like to remind you that a 8-15 mile distance from the hotel, will see travel times of upwards of 90 minutes to 2 hours. Uber will experience surge pricing of nearly 3-10x and with an estimated 20,000+ extra visitors in the Philadelphia area bus services will be disrupted. With this warning, there willOnce our delegation has been certified, a website will be used to reserve all of the Hotel rooms for our delegation. Either you will get a chance to reserve your room OR you can contact me after that certification period is over so I can reserve it myself. It isn't necessary for you to stay at the hotel, but it will be highly encouraged.The Iowa Democratic Party will hosts breakfast meetings each morning on-site of the Marriott Hotel, this will also be your only chance to pickup your credentials for that day. Due to logistics and the amount of staff on hand, this will be the one and only time you will have to pick up your credentials. If you decide to rent a different room, it will be up to you to arrange travel to the Marriott Hotel and to pick up your credentials in time with the schedule of our Breakfast meetings.The Marriott Hotel is within walking distance of the DNC Convention and is accessible via their Skywalk system.Air Travel You are responsible for your travel to the Philadelphia from Des Moines, I've used kayak and Expedia to find some flights and currently at 4:46pm on May 11th there are flights from Des Moines to Philadelphia for $290 leaving Saturday July 23rd and returning on July 30th. Here is what Kayak.com says are the price ranges for flights.(in case the graphic didn't show up. Round trip from Saturday to Saturday is $290. Leaving Sunday and arriving Friday $346, Saturday/Sunday $318) Reminder that these prices change from day to day and the longer you take to order the price will change.Recommendations 1.We don't have a schedule yet of what the Convention will look like and we won't get that information until we certify our delegates.2. Staff for the Iowa Democratic Party are headed to Philadelphia May 18-21st to do a run through of the Hotel and preliminary meetings about the Convention, we will have an update at that point about any additional information we will have.3. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Book your flight to Philadelphia ASAP and save or fund-raise for your Hotel.4.

As you can see for yourself, it's a simple, yet culturally-rich place; it's a quiet, yet vibrant sanctuary. For decades, immigrants and refugees have chosen to enter through places like my hometown in an attempt to start anew. But the current administration is making that difficult by complicating the asylum-seeking process and reducing funding for service-based organizations. That's why we ask for your continued help in the last remaining days of our Not Just a Toy campaign, which will directly benefit Refugee Services of Texas as it works to integrate our fellow human beings into society following an already-arduous journey.Please make a contribution that best suits your budget. Any amount you donate is greatly appreciated, but if you need some suggestions, consider these:$25 = Welcome Meal for an arriving family$50 = month’s worth of public transportation$75 = week’s worth groceries for a family$100 = 5 hours of interpretation for intake interviews$500 = emergency medical services for an unaccompanied minor$1,000 = mother & child application for citizenship$1,500 = furnish an apartment for a new refugee familyABOUT REFUGEE SERVICES OF TEXASRefugee Services of Texas is a social service agency dedicated to resettling and providing services to refugees and other displaced persons who are fleeing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, and/or political opinion. Since its founding in 1978, RST has successfully resettled more than 15,000 refugees. Refugee Services of Texas is the state's largest refugee resettlement agency with offices in Amarillo, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and the Rio Grande Valley.RST recently celebrated its fortieth year of providing direct services to displaced persons now living in the United States, including refugees, asylees and survivors of human trafficking. With six sites across the state, including a developing site in the Rio Grande Valley, RST served 1,158 clients last year, including 40 percent of the refugees resettled in the state. Funds raised through “Not Just a Toy” will give clients in the Rio Grande Valley a chance to achieve self-sufficiency with dignity, after a long and arduous journey of victimization and persecution.  “Imagine being met with violence after traveling hundreds of miles to escape it,” exclaims Xorje Olivares, host of Affirmative Reaction on SiriusXM Progress Channel 127 (Saturdays 12p ET). “Then, imagine after spending weeks reassuring your children that freedom is near, having to run for safety but not knowing where to run -- since you're strangers in the borderland. Survival and asking for asylum should NEVER be this hard and yet here we are.”  “The entire immigration situation, as it's being handled by our current administration, fuels my activism as a border native, as it does countless others nationwide…” says Xorje “Nearly 44,000 immigrants in detention, roughly 14,000 of which are youth, it's apparent that a lot needs to be done to assist those who are either lost in the system or victims of a broken one.” Together, Xorje Olivares, HeyXorje.com, and Refugee Services of Texas are on a mission to raise enough to impact those from Mexico and far beyond who are seeking a route to safety in the U.S. Funds will be used to support clients’ basic needs including shelter, food, clothing, healthcare and legal assistance. Service recipients receive case management services and employment assistance, as well as ascultural orientation and English classes through RST.  “Our clients come with no other physical belongings than the clothes on their backs,” says RST CEO, Russell Smith.  “We want to give them a wonderful holiday this year, but more than just toys are needed. With recent cuts in federal funding and a record low cap on the number of refugees entering the country, we need the people of Texas to rally around refugees and displaced peoples and show them that we are a place of refuge and support.” PLEASE DONATE NOW.  THANK YOU https://heyxorje.comhttps://www.gofundme.com/toys-for-tornillowww.rstx.org@HeyXorje @XorjeO #NotJustAToyPress:Chris Kelley, The Kelley GroupPhone: 214-457-5266Email: Chris@KelleyNotes.com"

I am thrilled to be interning for my Congressional Representative Lizzie Fletcher (TX-7) at her Washington office. As someone who campaigned and worked for Lizzie's election last year, I am so excited to have the opportunity to intern for her.  I intend to maximize this opportunity every way possible. I am very grateful for the generosity and hospitality of the Whitfield/Jones family for opening their home to me during my stay in D.C.As always, there's lots of interesting news coming out of our nation's capital. To me, the one of the greatest accomplishments of the current legislative session is yesterday's historic vote in the House of Representatives that requires federal criminal background checks for all gun sales. For the first time in decades, our government is addressing these important gun safety issues.Several people have asked me to shed some light on what I am doing, in addition to this campaign, to secure funding for college.  For several months, I have been tutoring two students several days per week.  I also recently started a part-time job that accommodates my school schedule. Finally, I continue to submit scholarship applications to various organizations.  All of this effort is made because, more than anything else, I want to attend NYU's Global Liberal Studies program.Lastly, I requested more time from NYU before I make my commitment-deposit.  I have a couple of extra weeks, during which time I continue to ask for your support.  THANK YOU. Original Post:I am in a humbling moment on the learning curve of life. I'm here asking for your help in covering tuition for the Global Liberal Studies program at NYU - - the college career path of my dreams! It is **this** program that I believe will give me the tools to pursue the path I have started paving, including my intention to help change gun laws in our country.Over the past year, I have seen tremendous opportunities open up in front of me. I have seized every opportunity I was given. An anonymous donation for me and my classmates to attend the March For Our Lives in Washington, D.C. changed my life.  While I have always been interested in following politics, the March For Our Lives inspired me to get involved.I have done just that!This past spring 2018, I was one of the student organizers for Houston's Youth Walkout against gun violence.  With a handful of other students from around the City of Houston, we made great efforts to rally several thousand high-school students and to speak up about the need for gun control in our State of Texas and in the United States.   https://www.chron.com/news/education/article/Houston-area-students-schools-prepare-for-12849131.php   I was quoted in the Houston Chronicle, “‘We're the generation that's grown up used to these kind of mass school shootings, and we're not going to be silenced as children anymore,’ said David Ilouz, a Houston Youth Walkout organizer and junior at The Emery/Weiner School in southwest Houston. ""We are going to get out there, and we are watching our leaders very, very closely.”We met with Houston's Mayor Sylvester Turner before the rally and asked him to speak to our youth.  Initially he declined, but on the day of the rally, even the Mayor could not sit idly by.  Our collective ability as students to get the Mayor to our podium inspired me to continue fighting for gun control.   One of my most proud moments of accomplishment was my speech in downtown Houston before our City Hall.  You can see me in action here:David's Youth Walkout Speech — Houston City Hall, April 20, 2018 I didn't quit after the rally.  Within a short time, I was invited to speak at our local Meyerland Democrat's monthly meeting.  Since that time, I also took it upon  myself to testify before the Texas legislature.  In June, 2018, I made a road trip to Austin, Texas to testify as a student activist and advocate. David's Testimony Before Texas State Legislature  (skip to 4:22:15)During the remainder of summer 2018 and throughout the fall, I spent every spare moment volunteering with the campaign of now-Rep. Lizzie Fletcher for Texas District 7 for the November 2018 mid-term elections. I was thrilled to have had the opportunity to be in the trenches for the candidate that I believed in, and I was inspired by her victory to unseat the long time Republican incumbent. Here is a snapshot from Lizzie's letter of recommendation sent to NYU as part of my college application for admission.I have long been interested in current events and the political process. My involvement in politics has been an important factor for me in the college application process and has been a large part of my interest in NYU and in the Global Liberal Studies Program. While I dream of studying in New York and building myself a new network of peers there, I plan to one day return to Texas and bring back a greater understanding of how to turn this state a deep shade of blue. I believe the GLS program with its focus on politics, rights, and development is the best one to help me achieve that goal. I also want to take advantage of the proximity to the United Nations, Wall Street, and all of the various components that are intertwined with these global, political, and economic systems headquartered in New York City. Just a few days ago, I received an acceptance letter from NYU following my Early Decision application. I was thrilled at the prospect of being accepted to attend, but the happiness was dampened at the reality that my single-parent family would be unable to pay for tuition, room, and board. My mother and I have had important conversations about what my undergraduate education will look like given our financial circumstances.This has been a truly humbling and enlightening experience for me. In some ways, I am prepared to make peace with the fact I may not attend NYU for financial reasons. In other ways, I find myself now more personally connected than ever to the hot topic of affordable college education in this country. Ultimately, it would be a dream-come-true for me to study at NYU. Realistically, I only have until the end of February 2019 to confirm my spot for the fall semester. The school has invited me to an admitted student event hosted on Friday, March 1, 2019.Finally, from my own personal, financial perspective, I received $8,980 in scholarship as well as a $3,000 work-study opportunity from NYU.  Over the course of this school year, I have been tutoring two children and have recently been hired for a part-time evening job. I have been able to set aside my earnings and will continue to do what I can for my education. However, without additional support, my undergraduate education will be elsewhere.THANK YOU for taking the time to read about me.  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE for whatever contribution you can make towards my college education.  David"

The estimated costs are between $3000-$4000 for the trip.  It is so important that every delegate get to the convention and be a voice not only for Bernie, but also for the rest of the country when we vote on very important items relating to what it means to mean a democrat in our country. The values that Bernie, you, and I share have been things I have been fighting for over the last ten years. I am currently a student, working on a Master's degree in social work and this political revolution stands very everything I believe in as a social worker, a person in recovery, a mother, and a grateful inhabitant of the planet we live on. The time to get involved is NOW and EVERYONE is needed! Help me get to Philadelphia to fight for the values that we need!"

Through snowstorms and harassment of every sort, we formed a community and discovered what true democracy felt like (not easy, but mostly democratic).   Our community included homeless, veterans, Muslims, Christians, Jews and Atheists, anarchists, democrats, former republicans, journalists, artists, musicians, plumbers, disabled, disenfranchised, students, drop-outs, lawyers, doctors, Palestinians, Turks, Puerto Ricans and Irish...  I could go on and on, but you get the gist.  We ate together, slept together, protested together, fought with each other, learned from each other, cried and laughed, mourned and celebrated, and in the end, even when our paths diverged, we were all changed and strengthened by our time together.The occupations in D.C. lasted longer than most, but on February 5th, the police arrived to clear us out.  Working groups formed, but the public face and place where anyone could join General Assemblies was gone.  The media declared Occupy dead.  Alternative news sources still report on housing foreclosures thwarted, money moved out of big banks, homeless shelters opened and on-going protests against drones, wars, Tar Sands pipelines, Monsanto and Citizens United: but, most of what Occupy continues to accomplish is happening without widespread attention and without the connection Occupy offered by bridging individual actions to one effort as a whole.On July 4th, I was in Paonia, Colorado visiting my sister when a hairdresser named Sid had an idea to protest the Koch Brother tank that was to lead the town parade.  I encouraged him, filmed it and put it up on YouTube labeled ""˜Tiananmen Sid Stops Tank'.  It got a bunch of views and the next night to our total surprise it was the lead story on Rachel Maddow.  A longtime media activist, the experience got me thinking about citizen journalism, and how it is the only place truth is being told.So, here's my new plan: I've paired up with a friend from Occupy Washington, D.C.  We're culturally miles apart.  She grew up in Texas.  She's Hispanic and met her birth mother for the first time at age 13.  She's 20 years younger than me, and she's pierced and tattooed.  I grew up white and protected in Aspen, Colorado surrounded by 1%ers.  I own a Prius and my own condo.  What we have in common is what took us out of our comfort zones to become Occupiers.  We love our country and our earth and we are beyond angry at the injustice, inequality and apathy we see everywhere.  We are not willing to sit back and take it anymore.  We are willing to sleep in tents and on couches and eat whatever we're offered and even go to jail if it means we can make some kind of a difference:A few days ago, I called my friend and asked her if she would like to go on a road trip with me to Search for Occupy:We're buying a camera and will video blog as we go.  We will document what Occupy is doing around the country.  At the end of our journey, we will put together a film to show every doubter out there what Occupy is doing, has done and will do:I've been advised to drop the ""˜Occupy' label. ""It doesn't raise money,"" I was told.  I have to laugh.  Since when was Occupy about raising money?  This will be a piece of OccuJournalism funded by those who help us along the way.  I can't think of a better way for me to spend my grandchildren's inheritance - the money my parents spent a lifetime earning.  No matter what we discover, my grandsons will be able to say, ""Our Nana was there.  She did everything she could.""So, watch for us.  We're drawing up a map and making a plan and we'd like to visit YOU.  "

In the past few years, the United States has become incredibly divided. Neighbors and families have been torn apart because of who they voted for in the previous election. The amount of hate people have expressed toward one another made me wonder: can politics still be a place where good things happen? PRECEDENT follows a group of people who believe it can. This isn’t a series that is Republican vs. Democrat. It is a series in which people who truly want America to be a better place team up, in spite of political differences. Our protagonists are moral, honest, and caring - patriots in every sense of the word.

I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in private practice and a part time time faculty member at VSU School of Social Work.  I am a resident of Georgia's Congressional 10th District and a life long democrat. Until this election, my involvement in local, state and national politics has been limited to voting.  I have been pulled into the political process. :)Last summer was the first time I ever heard of Senator Bernie Sanders. I felt called into this movement from the moment I heard his Presidential announcement campaign speech. Shortly after, I went to my first rally in South Carolina and subsequently became an “obsessive” volunteer for Bernie Sanders.  hahahaha An unexpected and beautifully amazing experience of being a supporter of Bernie Sanders is the built in sense of community that's understood when you meet another supporter. Bernie Sanders supporters are friends you haven't met yet and that has been proven to me over and over again.  I decided in November 2015  I was going  to run as a Delegate for my Congressional District. Through fall and winter, I worked tirelessly with other supporters all across the country  as we rallied behind our candidate and our movement heading into Iowa and New Hampshire. In January I volunteered in helping to organize the representation of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Atlanta Martin Luther King, Jr. March. I marched with other Atlanta Bernie supporters, Union Teamsters and the Democratic Socialist of America.  As we prepared for Super Tuesday, I campaigned heavily in Georgia by making buttons, phone banking and canvassing. I knocked on hundreds of doors and made hundreds of phone calls. I spoke with strangers and took advantage of any opportunity to educate the public about Bernie's platform, often using my own money to print literature and make buttons. District 10 fought very hard for our one delegate. You think its hard being a democrat in a red state...be a Bernie Sanders supporter in a red state.  Whew...Our work did not end here, we came out of the south behind but we never stopped pushing forward. Our campaign was prepared for a loss and we began vigorously investing our energy into the upcoming primary states and caucuses. We've done tremendously well outside the south as we've moved into more progressive areas of the country.  Our grassroots online community is stellar in every possible way. It fills me up to know so many like minded people are committed to the political revolution. It is awe inspiring. <3 On April 16, 2016 I was voted in my District to represent Bernie Sanders at the 2016 Democratic National Convention!!!!!!  I am now raising money to help fund this next step of the journey. I am financially responsible for ALL delegated related expenses including, but not limited, travel, lodging, meals, registration fees, etc. - Airfare or other transportation to Philadelphia - All 5 nights of hotel and related expenses. The hotel price will be roughly $400-$450 a night, but may be more depending on hotel assignment. Georgia is assigned a hotel and hotels do not accept partial bookings. There will be opportunities to bunk up with other delegates—but it is not guaranteed. Since it's now likely contested they have strongly encouraged us to stay at the delegation hotel. We have credentialing every morning at 7am followed by meetings. If its a  contested convention we can be called on the floor for a vote at anytime and if we are not there due to logistics or traffic or whatnot then Bernie loses that delegate vote.Attending the Convention will cost several thousand dollars and is solely the responsibility of the Delegate. These funds will be needed by June 7, 2016. As any Bernie Sanders supporter can imagine this is a dream come true. As a social worker, this is a dream come true. I was born in 1972. Most of my life I've been told that I missed  my era because I didn't live through the 60's. I am a liberal hippie at heart and a proud progressive. Being part of this political revolution is part of my journey on this earth. This is bigger than a presidential campaign for me. This is bigger than politics. I am standing witness to an awakening of human consciousness,  not only in American politics but on a global scale.  I am very proud to be a part of it. It's a transformation our spiritual beings are yearning for and one that I, along with many others, have prayed for. I know I am standing and fighting on the right side of history.  I am living my truth. Being part of this campaign aligns with one of my most significant  guiding principles written by Mahatma Ghandi; Be The Change You Wish To See In The World.  I would be extremely grateful for any contribution to help me fund this journey. I vow to represent Georgia's Congressional 10th District with the honesty, integrity, conviction and passion that are the fundamentals to this campaign.  In solidarity, angHere is an article and video by the Atlanta Journal Constitution of me campaigning prior to Super Tuesday if you'd like to get a better feel for me.

She was surrounded by the family that loved her and held her through her ordeal. She has moved on and the love that she leaves us is fresh in our hearts. The purple ribbons that have adorned the world help us to see the lives and people she, and her fight, have touched. The purpose of this page is to help Paul and Liz with the needs of taking care of the mortal remains if their little Blue Eyed girl. The goal has been set to $1 because we are only asking for you to help if you can and with what you can. There is no end point here - anything past what they need will be used for a scholarship or donation to help others. Paul and Liz are two of the most amazing, and giving, people you will ever meet. They have 5 beautiful children. In October of 2012, Amanda (Amanda Panda as Paul calls her), at the age of 4, was diagnosed with a brain tumor. It was removed and she moved on to a radiation treatment. After each step she received an MRI that showed no cancer. By all accounts she was an amazing patient throughout her radiation treatment. She completed her chemotherapy treatments in early April and had a follow up MRI which showed the tumor had returned and was located in several spots along her spine. She was an amazing patient, enduring hours of MRI scans and medications, taking it much better than many adults would. Througout it all Paul and Liz kept the family close and together. In Novemeber of 2014 Amanda started slowing down. It is now January and she has passed her 6th birthday! Paul has taken some time off of work to be there with his family and his beautiful blue eyed daughter. This fundraiser is designed to provide Paul and Liz supplemental money to help with meals, medical expenses, and other expenses toward taking care of Amanda on her journey. All money collected here will go directly to them. If you don't know the Conrows, go to their caringbridge site to read about their lovely daughter and her fight against cancer: http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/amandaconrowThe Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester did a beautiful story on her and the care that she has received at Strong Hospital: http://www.democratandchronicle.com/longform/news/2014/12/23/amanda-conrow-ependymoma-rochester-palliative-care/20818197/I created this page out of love and respect for my friends Paul and Liz. Paul and I have taught together for 14 years, co-created an innovative program in our school, and have carpooled over many years and many meetings. We have shared our childrens births, family moments, and many other events.

I am a delegate to the Nebraska State Convention asking for your support and vote to become a National Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, PA.I “BELIEVE IN SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS” and, his “PEOPLE’S AGENDA!” Bernie wants to see change happen in this country of ours. From Social Justice, Health Care, Minimum Wage, Equal Pay for Women, Free Education from our Community Colleges and so much more. Bernie is the “TORCH BEARER FOR THIS MOVEMENT” for such a time as this…..I am honored to have helped with and encourage people concerning voter registration here and in Indiana during the caucus and primary.Early on, I came from a middle class family. I am next to the oldest of ten children. My mom and dad were lifelong democrats and hard working people. Both of my parents worked the polls at election time when I was a little girl. My mom continued to do so until this past year. My mom, the late Mrs. Johnnie Lee Goodman McNeil was very adamant about helping and encouraging others to register to vote. As a little girl growing up in Indiana during the civil right era, I witnessed social injustice at an early age. Both of my parents were originally from Arkansas.My parents were sincerely “NON NEGOITIABLE” when it came to education. Just like Bernie. It was a “MUST” that we all complete high school. I knew from the time I was around the age of three years old that, I was going to attend college. Why? Because my daddy told me so! He realized the importance of a college education. My dad, the late Roy Lee Goodman, Sr. placed that goal to attend college and to succeed early on. Most in my family have attended college. Some are starting for the first time, some have graduated, including myself and returning to college to further my education.I am a former Underground Coal Miner, an Ordained Pastor, I have a B.S. in Biology, I am a Breast Cancer Outreach Nurse at The Malone Community Center (The African-American Center in Lincoln, Nebraska), a Community Health Worker and a Lay Ambassador with DHHS. I have received awards for my Advocacy/Activism for Social Justice and Human Rights. I am appointed by Mayor Chris Beutler of Lincoln, Nebraska to serve on three different Advisory Boards. I am a member of the MAC (Multicultural Advisory Committee) which tries to help advise Mayor Chris Beutler, The Keno board which distributes over a million dollars each year to various non-profit organizations in order to empower and, better our communities. I actively take part in deciding in the distribution of those monies. I also serve on the Star Tran City Bus Transit Transportation for the City of Lincoln. I listen very carefully to the concerns and needs of the citizens of Lincoln. I always vote according to what I believe is best for the citizens and weight various option concerning the budget in meeting those needs for our patrons.I am also a 7 year Breast Cancer Survivor. I was diagnosed in November of 2008 right after the election. I had 3 surgeries (Two at the beginning and one towards the end of all treatments). I had previously phone banked, “STOMPED” (""ON THE STUMP!"") in Lincoln, Omaha, Indiana- (Numerous times on my own dime) and, in Florida while on vacation (NO VACTION!).”I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!”. After being diagnosed with Stage 2 Left Side Breast Cancer, I phoned banked for various city and state officials while doing many rounds of chemo. I also was chosen (While doing chemo) by my then, State Senator Ken Haar to do the opening prayer at the unicameral in 2009. I had opportunity to go to Washington, D.C to testify on Capitol Hill concerning the Affordable Care Act. I stopped my radiation treatment with more than half to complete just to testify for this very important and urgent bill which, is now law. My radiologist was ""NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT MY DECISION"" to do so. I made many trips to our Nation’s Capitol concerning that bill and others. Prior to the above, in March of 2007 I lost my dad to Lymphoma. I recently lost my dear mom to liver cancer in January of this year.I am so very proud to be a nurse. I was made even prouder after watching the “HEROICS” of all the first responders. Included are those “AWESOME” dedicated nurse’s who, helped in the cares concerning the shooting victims in Orlando, Florida. The picture on the bottom to the right are those Nurses and staff.I will continue to focus on voter registration, phone banking here in Nebraska and, Indiana. I will also volunteer for Anna Wishart’s Campaign. Last, but not least, I will continue to lend my voice and, a hand for those causes that I and Senator Bernie Sanders are so passionate about.Respectfully submitted,Pastor Janet Goodman Banks (Voter registration card: Janet M.

This was a big shock for a 37 year old non-smoker. The biopsy revealed she was positive for lung cancer, specifically 'Moderately Differentiated Invasive Adenocarcinoma'.For the last handful of years Jenn has worked during the night with the Democrat & Chronicle to be home during the day for her three boys. With the nature of Jenns work she is considered self employed, so she will not be receiving disability benefits or compensation for lost wages.  Jenn is pending surgery soon to have the cancer removed from her lung, this will require a week in the hospital and no work for at least 6-8 weeks. Chemotherapy may be necessary after surgery. There will be a loss of half the household income, and an increase of medical expenses.

By a stroke of luck, they were away on Saturday night when an electrical fire ignited in the master bedroom and quickly engulfed the house. If you'd like, you can read The Tallahassee Democrat's recent article about the fire  here. ‌The bad news: Everything Julie, Delilah, and Ramzy owned was destroyed in the flames. Everything.

Other things, however, can be replaced.What can you do to help?  Please share this fundraiser with everyone you know on social media and consider making a contribution. With a donation as small as a dollar, you can help provide relief for Julie, Delilah, and Ramzy in this troubling time.

She is a devoted mother, an animal lover, and the sort of person who has always been eager to help out others in need.Delilah is fifteen and has just started the ninth grade. She plays the ukulele and guitar and, though she may not admit it, has a wonderful singing voice. Unfortunately, her instruments were destroyed in the fire along with all her clothes, backpack, laptop, school supplies, and her collection of nonfiction and true crime books. Interesting facts: favorite band is The Smiths; favorite subject in school is History; and she wants to be a criminal profiler when she “grows up.”Ramzy is eleven and has just started the sixth grade. She loves to draw and paint, but her easel and pencils and supplies were destroyed in the fire along with all her clothes, school supplies, and her collection of fantasy and mystery novels. Interesting facts: favorite band is Twenty-One Pilots; she writes short stories; and she wants to be a gymnast when she “grows up.”If you’ve read this far, thank you.

$2,214 raised of $3,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/garysberniejourney,"Houston, TX",Gary's Bernie Journey to Philly!,"Created May 14, 2016","Update: 6/23/2016I've been selected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Texas! I am still pressing forward for Bernie and for OUR revolution. I had intended on staying offstie with a wonderful friend, but due to the shenanagains we have seen at other conventions we want our Texas state delegates to stay together as a group, so I have had to make adjustments to the amount of money I will need to get to Philly and be an effective delegate for Bernie Sanders. I have had so many wonderful friends and stragers donate to my Bernie Journey, and I appreciate everyone who has helped me, even though I am a delegate from Texas, I will be representing all of you at the convention, and will make sure our voice is heard!---------------------------Hi, I'm Gary, I have been volunteering for Bernie Sanders since November in Houston, and have volunteered through NOLA, Milwaukee, Brooklyn, Portland, and now I am on the train headed to Oakland CA. I keep asking myself, how the hell did I get here........ Well here it is.It all started when I worked up the courage and went to my first Houstonian for Bernie meeting in November of 2015, just over 6 months ago. I met some incredible people. This is where I first met my friend Krystal, who has fought by my side in 3 states now. Thank you Krystal for always being a friend to me and helping me along this journey, you are like a sister to me. She was on the front lines in Texas, Louisiana, and Oregon and she is amazing. Once the Bernie Sanders HQ opened in Houston it took me a little while to build up the courage to go in and make phone calls to total strangers in front of total strangers. Up until that point I was pretty much a home body, I had anxiety, I had self doubt, and I didn’t enjoy interacting with people most of the time because I always felt judged and insecure. Friends would try and get me to go out and I would always have an excuse, but once I began going to Bernie HQ those things became easier, I could interact with strangers because we were all kinda outsiders in a way. One day I decided to host a Bernie event at my apartment to find other supporters in the area. There were 5 people signed up, and I was stoked for Montrose for Bernie to be a thing. One person showed up. Edward, DJ extraordinaire and all around cool guy, we tried to brain storm ideas, but in the end we ended up deciding that we needed to be at HQ, making it happen with the campaign instead of off on our own. He’s been by my side in NOLA, Houston, and PDX as well, and is as devoted to Bernie today as he was when we met at my place all those months ago. So we both started spending a lot of time there at HQ. I had met the director Theresa at a Houstonian for Bernie meeting, but didn't get to know her until I went to HQ. Her direction was key in me being where I am today, she taught me so much about organizing and helped give me the courage to talk in front of different political groups in the Houston area, facing one of my biggest fears. Aside from Theresa there was one constant at Houston Bernie HQ. Raun. He was always there, he was always happy to help do whatever was needed. It took awhile to learn his sense of humor and his aptitude for sarcasm, but once I did I knew I had a friend for life, he is family to me. He knows things about me before I do sometimes, and helped set into motion a very important change in my life. By December I was at HQ any time that I had free time, and was getting close with so many volunteeres. During one of our big Day of Actions I hosted an event with Travis at our friend Jane Anns office. (I love Jane Ann! She is a Bernie Believer as strong as any!) His energy and determination helped me push through the long days that were getting longer. When the March 1st primary finally came around HQ was practically home to me since my partner Julio and I had moved a few weeks before, and I had neglected unpacking. Julio has been so supportive of me during this journey, I could not ask for a better partner in my life. On March 2nd, my friends Raun, Travis, Krystal and myself went to dinner with the director for our Bernie HQ Theresa and her partner Chris. She ?jokingly? asked if some of us wanted to go knock on doors in New Orleans that weekend. We were all really exhausted from our Texas GOTV, and for some reason Raun and Travis agreed, and I said it sounded fun. I think I got tricked into it, because the next thing I know I got an email with housing information and time of departure for Edward, Raun, Travis, and me. Well during that trip I was fired from my job. Long story short, it was probably the best thing to happen to me, and having my friends there to support me through it was amazing. We bonded so much over those few days they are all family to me now. That is a common occurrence during this journey, bonding with people and feeling like family. Like community. We put in some late nights working in NOLA, and it was so much fun working for Sarah at their HQ and working the city! Some of us headed home, some stayed to explore the city more. Next thing I know Travis and Raun are headed to Salt Lake City to volunteer and after some long talks with friends I decided that I wanted to go to another state and help Bernie also. So after talking with Theresa it was decided that Wisconsin needed some help, so she arranged for me to be expected up there, and I took the MegaBus 30 hours from Houston to Dallas, Dallas to Chicago, Chicago to Milwaukee. Milwaukee was a (Side note, I just got a text from a volunteer Alessandra, who I met in New York, who Lives in Seattle, who is going to Portland tomorrow to volunteer, I’m sad I missed her! Another Volunteer Mark I met in Milwaukee is flying into Portland on Saturday and will be knocking on doors for Bernie!) Milwaukee was a blast! I met volunteers from across the country there. Teresa and Linda from Portland, a mother daughter team who worked their butts off helping out, David and Ben from Florida who were great canvassers and trainers. Riley from NOLA who I was sharing housing with and loved recording our conversations and painting, Brad from Southern CA who had lived in Sweden for 3 years or longer. He came back to America just to help campaign for Bernie. Keith, who I think is from PA, who could run a canvassing event with his hands tied behind his back and who got me housing in my next stop on my Journey and has constantly checking in with me, planning for the future of the movement. Emily the animal rights activist from Manhattan who brought us vegan donuts so many mornings, and who has been to so many states helping Bernie! The Detroit crew, Jeff, Dan, Daniel, Derek and Erin, grassroots guys who have genius ideas and have helped create several tools to help people on their Bernie Journeys and college outreach in so many states! I also met some amazing local Bernie supporters, my dear friend Sara who helped run the phone banks and drove from polling location to polling location on Election Day keeping a tally of numbers. Terry who would bring us food to keep the troops fed! Dickey, a guy who just came in to canvass, and ended up taking home 2 out of state volunteers so they could stay a few more days and keep pushing on for Bernie! Bobbie and Don who invited me to stay at their home while I volunteered, and invited Riley and me to Easter dinner on my second day there. Again, people treating me like family, a sense that we were welcome there as family. It was a wonderful experience working in the office there. Whitney, Roger, and Hanna were great leaders, and allowed me to help run the phone banks and greet volunteers as they came in and direct them where they needed to be. One day when I was working the phone bank the campaign director in Milwaukee Whitney said that there were some volunteers (Greg and Erika who I still email and will hopefully be meeting for dinner at one point in the Bay Area) who wanted to help other volunteers keep working for Bernie by paying for flights from Chicago to New York to help with the campaign. I had every intention of going to Portland after Wisconsin to join up with my friends Raun and Travis, but after talking to all my friends and my partner Julio, I chose to accept the ticket, and next thing I know my 2 week trip is turned into a 4 week trip and I left Wisconsin the night of the primary after polls closed and flew out to NYC the next day. I couldn’t find housing in New York (Seriously, amazing views Photos through dirty train windows will follow) I couldn’t find housing in New York at first, but my friend Keith knew someone who knew someone. And so I was connected with Chris in Harlem, musical genius, French horn player, jazz pianist, member of the New Jersey Symphony and plays in Le Mis, another all around cool guy. I stayed in his converted office where he had built a bed about 2 feet from the ceiling. The first night I was worried I would be claustrophobic, but I think the exhaustion from Wisconsin had caught up with me so I slept like a rock, and after that I didn’t give it a second thought. He would play his piano into all hours of the night, and it was amazing falling asleep listening to someone play music, not just the radio. Commuting to the Brooklyn office was an experience, mass transit has been fun in every city, but I think New York was the best because it was always going and there were always people interested in my Bernie gear. I would give out lit, buttons, shirts if I had them, and people loved it. I only ever got one guy who told me to F off when he looked at my Bernie shirt. The Brooklyn office was always so busy. There was always something going on or coming in or going out. I got to work with Sarah from NOLA again, and she was working with a crack team of locals and staff up there. Gail and Tia were phone bank captains, always keeping the troops going even when a class full of high school students’ show up to phone bank and when the internet went down. Eli and Anita (Anita also is letting me stay at her house in Oakland while I volunteer) who did everything from help direct volunteers to train canvassers and keep the office running smooth. Lisa the office manager who kept all those volunteers fed and in a clean space. She was a volunteer there in Brooklyn and she was there all the time, so organized and so nice and kept that office running like a machine! We had some great talks and I loved working with her, again, so many amazing people I have met along the way, all committed to pushing forward Bernie Sanders. I helped work rallies, I recruited volunteers, I canvassed and I fliered subway stations. I learned things from union workers and staffers that I would never have been exposed to in my old life, and I think that Brooklyn is where I decided I no longer want an office job, I think this experience has opened up completely new avenues for me. My time in New York was split between two houses. First with Chris in Harlem, then with a sweet couple Eni and Greg in Brooklyn. This would be the first election Eni could vote in and she was very excited. I taught her how to phone bank, and she made calls to voters in New York as well as let me stay in their home. It was still a 45 minute commute, even though it was in the same borough! After the election I could have gone back to Houston and joined back with Josephine and Theresa planning the Senate District for the Texas State Democratic Convention, or begin building our coalition for progressive change locally after Bernie is elected, but there was a 67 dollar flight to Portland out of Chicago, and how could I pass it up? A friend had given me money to help me along the trip, and I used that to get to Portland to reunite with my Houston friends! One problem, there was a day and a half layover in Chicago between flights. This time Brad came to the rescue, connecting me with Darrell, a canvasser who carpooled to Milwaukee from Chicago to canvass for Bernie. He connected me with Sara, an art teacher in Chicago. She has her own bad ass house and rents rooms to people. My room had a Labyrinth poster with David Bowie on it and the door was a hidden bookshelf! So on April 20th, I spent the day with two people I didn’t know and who welcomed me into their home, and gave me rides to and from the airport, and they are amazing! The next day on the way to the airport I got to check eating at White Castle off of my bucket list, and managed to catch my flight to Portland. (I had missed my first flight out of New York by like 15 minutes and was rerouted through Boston to Chicago) I had intended on taking a break when I arrived in Portland, but since their voter registration deadline was 4 days away I hit the dialer and tried to recruit more volunteers. I worked a rally in Salem and got about 30 people to commit to help Bernie win by knocking doors and making calls. I helped out in the office there in Portland and met some cool people, Jazzy, Ian, Cole, Pearl, James, Morgan, and Patrick were all working with my Houston friends making sure the state gets the attention it needs, and Jitterbug, Ian’s dog, was president of Dogs for Bernie there in the office and the office mascot. You can’t walk past Jitterbug and not pet her. I don't know if having Jitterbug there made me happy or made me miss Cuddles more. Oregon is an oddity when it comes to voting, they are mailed their ballots and they mail them back in. They are also a closed primary state, so people must be registered as a democrat to vote for Bernie! We have the same issue in California, and that brings us to today. Voter turnout is crucial, and most people registering to vote will be voting for Bernie, so I want to devote as much time as possible to registering voters, and then I want to continue on to the DNC in Philly this July. They will hear OUR voice. They will know OUR might. It’s dark outside now so the views are no longer there to distract me. Here is where it gets difficult. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for so many people. The level of love and support I am getting from people is so fantastic. I have named a fraction of those I have met along this trip that have helped me, I am trying to write down something about every person I meet in my journal, every person who I can talk to and possibly help, Jose the owner of 559 Smoke Shop in Brooklyn, Maria, the sweet transgender woman who was so timid and shy when I first met her, but was phonebanking and facebanking like a pro within 2 visits to HQ, JoAnne (from Brooklyn) the amazing woman who opened her home to me in Portland, claiming she didn’t cook, but there was always something good in the fridge to eat, I’ll end up in Portland again just to visit her and enjoy the beauty of the city again. I met a guy on the train on his way home from college. He is now registered to vote. His name is Andy, he’s on his way home from his freshman year at college, and his biggest concern is the criminal justice system. Mandatory minimums and prison over crowding. I encouraged him to get involved, he said there were some protests at his school, I told him there should be a Bernie office in Santa Barbra pretty soon, or at least one pretty close to there. He’s voting for Bernie. That’s one more vote for Bernie! Doing this work is easy, it’s what I have in my heart, I think Bernie can help our country in ways no other candidate will. His consistency over his entire career fighting for the poor and the ignored, fighting against corporations and pharmaceutical companies gouging the dying inspires me to fight for him. Like I said I have had so many people help me along the way, and the fight is still going. People have helped me with travel expenses, people have offered to buy me dinner, and people have helped me when I couldn’t afford my medicine since I don’t have insurance anymore. If you support Bernie, and want to help me keep fighting for him through the convention I obviously cannot do it alone. Bernie Sanders isn't just a candidate, he is a community, and I am calling out to the community for assistance. A grocery store gift card, money to help pay bus fair, taking me out to dinner if I’m in your town, anything is appreciated as I continue fighting for Bernie. Fighting for US!"

$2,020 raised of $3,503                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/kellycampaignschool,"Round Rock, TX",Kelly Darby Campaign School,"Created April 23, 2018","Dear friends,On April 22, I received my official acceptance to attend the Women's Campaign School in New Haven, Connecticut. This is a competitive, week long intensive program on the campus of Yale University, and I have been chosen to join the Class of 2018 this summer! A little bit about what compelled me to apply to this program: Over a year ago, I was compelled by national events to take a more active role in the political process. I formed an advocacy group called Texans Focus on Children and recruited members of my community who were willing to stand up for abused and neglected children at the Texas Capitol. As inspiring as it was to stand beside parents and advocates in our call for compassionate leadership, I was discouraged (to put it mildly) to see so many lawmakers in my home state turn their backs on the children of Texas under the banner of ""family values"" or “party unity.”  By the time the Legislature adjourned, I knew that my advocacy efforts alone would not make a difference. Quite simply, Texas needs new elected leaders. Democrats, Republicans, Independents - leaders who will listen to their constituents and put aside partisanship for the greater good. My new goal: find these new leaders and help them show our old leaders the door. I am almost prepared to do this. My passion alone will get me about 80% of the way there, but there is still plenty for me to learn. Last year, I made a new friend who had just completed this program - a week-long intensive that simulates an entire political campaign and teaches students about the many sides of a campaign- budgets, strategy, and so much more. I took this as a sign and applied for my own spot as soon as the application process opened in February.I am ready to get on a plane and get to work – like, yesterday!  I am humbly asking for your support to help me finance this bit of professional development in the hopes that I can help bring about real change in the great state of Texas. In order to attend The Women’s Campaign School at Yale, I need to cover the following expenses: Tuition: $1,800Airfare: $419Hotel (Marriot Courtyard, where many of the events will take place): $1,284.56Total: $3503 I would be honored to have your support – any support – whether that be $5, $10, $15, or more.I believe that progressive and conservative values can coexist in Texas. We owe it to the children of Texas to resolve our differences and find solutions to the complicated problems that ail our education system, child protective services, criminal justice system, and more. Our current leaders will not get us there, but I know there are plenty of great fish in the big ol' Texas pond.  Thank you so much for your generosity and support. I look forward to keeping you all updated on this journey! Sincerely,Kelly Darby"

I started at 3,182 days and I am now registered to vote and only 168 days away.  On my 17 1/2 birthday (The first day you can register to vote in the state of Missouri) I registered to vote in front of my Kansas City Hillary volunteers/supporters.The money raised will cover the cost of my round trip to Philadelphia and hotel expenses which are expected to be extremely high.

$9,777 raised of $15,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/johnpfeilseason,"New York, NY",#JohnPfeilSeason,"Created May 17, 2016","Hi. My name is Blake. I am one of three children who was co-created by a man named John Moloney Pfeil of Lockport, NY. This is John:￼... he's on the left. My father. To say that my father is the man would be one thing; to say that my father is THE (note the capslock and bold font) man is another, and the latter is far closer to the truth. I know that a lot of folks out there stake claims: ""My dad is great, my pops is greater than yours, my papa is nothing short of the greatest!"" I hear you. I'm glad you feel that way. I have to disagree. John Moloney Pfeil of Lockport, NY is the world's best father. He has never touched a cigarette. He's hiked Everest. He is an All-American athlete. He has not one but TWO US patents - I don't know what he invented, but it was something cool. He has a really wicked sense of humor. He's the kindest person I know. His heart is actually composed of pure gold. I've had so many friends tell me that they wish my dad was their dad, and I calmly reply, ""He is. He's everyone's dad."" That's a fact. My father's door is always open for the poor, wayfaring stranger. Everyone is worth something to my dad, even the liberalist of Democrats. (He's a registered Republican. We disagree there, but he sincerely loves and appreciates the art of musical theatre, so he gets a free pass.)￼And it just so happens that, because of all his awesomeness, the past year or so has been #JohnPfeilSeason. I'm going to share a sorta-secret with you now. My father got sick last year, and it wasn't until very recently that we got a solid diagnosis: lung cancer. The ugly, ugly C word. Specifically, mesothelioma. We didn't want to hear it, but if you must know, we're glad to at least have a conclusive answer because first they said it was. Then they said it might be. Then they said it wasn't. And then they went back to the cancer answer. And so it went, round and round like this, for ten months. John was passed around for the past ten months, from doctor to doctor, none of whom could provide a solid answer as to what was happening with my dad until very recently when we got the answer, finally. This is the email my father sent our closest family/friends last week:___________________________________Guys,I went to see a Dr. Takita this week. He is a thoracic surgeon who is 85 years old with a heavy Japanese accent. That would put him at about 14 at the end of WW2. Sadly, I suspect he knows what a B29 looks like. Beth looked him up, and reports he has an excellent reputation. His office staff tells me he still plays racquetball quite often. Ya gotta love it!I guess the key info in that consultation was that the last PET/CT scan I had showed something on the lower lobe of my right lung (the one that has collapsed 9 times). The ""brightness"" of a hot spot on a PET scan is measured in ""Standardized Uptake Values"" (SUVs) which range from 0 for no uptake to 15 for maximal uptake. Most cancers are above 2 or 3. Sometimes, highly metabolic normal tissues can also be in that range. In my scan, the spherical structure, sorry to say, has an SUV of 7.8. High-SUV structures look very bright when one is viewing the scan. Mine looks like a spotlight. : (There is another abnormality in that lung, namely an area of thickening in the tissue surrounding the lung. This seems concentrated in a small area (less than 1"", is my guess). It has a normal SUV, so the doc is not worried about that one.I have been scheduled for a May 24th surgery to remove the problematic tissue via a thoracoscopy, or more descriptively, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This will probably involve 2 incisions in my chest wall to insert a camera and the surgical instrument. After slicing and dicing, they will leave a thoracic catheter that allows the lung cavity to drain. I will probably be at Kenmore Mercy Hospital for three days. If surgery removes the cause of my lung collapses, the catheter will be taken out some day. If the cause persists, they will leave it in so that my monthly ""oil changes"", as Meg calls them, will no longer be necessary. After removal of the tumor, the lab folks check to see if further treatment is indicated (e.g., chemo or radiation therapy).I remain optimistic, so no worries. : )_______________________________________""OK. An answer. Let's act,"" we all said.Here's the thing, though. Leave it to John to retire and lose good health insurance altogether. The all-star athlete, non-smoker, healthiest dude alive got cancer, had super insurance for years that he never needed, retired, and a few months later got sick. Go figure.￼I know you see these all the time - which is a terrible, terrible fact in the world. And it's a terrible, terrible fact that our country's health insurance system is in dire need of continued restructuring. My dad is unemployed, and he needs help to solve this issue. (Side note: the issue, aka cancer, was given a name: Clynton.) And it's our plan to kill Clynton. We're going to annihilate her in cold blood, but we need your help.￼This money is going to help cover the cost of my dad's costly care. That's it. And if you've ever met him, you know that he would NEVER ask for help. In fact, I haven't told him that I'm doing this. He'd rather kill me for doing this than kill Clynton with the help of friends. It's part of his strange loveliness, but that's where we're at right now. If you've never met John, I can make that happen. We can sit down together and FaceTime him, and he can tell you all the stories about his incredible, valuable, wonderful life that he has lived fully and truly, enough that I don't think he should have to stop yet. This isn't the way that my father is supposed to leave this planet; it's not cool enough. He needs to leave it by saving a pile of puppies from a burning building or jumping in the way of a young chap or gal who almost steps in front of a bus or better yet? Peacefully. Not at the hand of his cancerous lungs.￼Not on my watch. Or yours.If you can toss a few dollars into the pot to help murder Clynton, I'll never forget it. Not as long as I live."

It was the best birthday present a girl could ask for!￼￼￼I’m currently a full time student at Nevada State, focused on finishing a B.S.N. (Bachelor of Science in Nursing). Over the past year, every minute that I was not at school, has been spent working for Hillary Clinton’s campaign as a Super Volunteer. During that time, I volunteered countless hours as I phone banked, canvassed, recruited other volunteers, encouraged many new voters to register, and even traveled to other states to help work their primaries. And somehow I also managed to co-chair LGBT NV Dems for Hillary.To know me is to know that I am profoundly passionate about what and also those that I believe in; and I wholeheartedly believe in Hillary Clinton. ￼￼￼￼￼￼Additionally, those who know me also know that it’s not typical for me to ask others for assistance. “I need your help.” Only four little words and yet for some of us they are four of the hardest words to get out. The truth is, I do need your help. As an elected delegate I am responsible for the financial responsibilities associated with attending the National Convention. These expenses include, but are not limited to; Hotel/boarding, airfare, and of course food. The estimate cost for this trip is upwards of $5,000, and partly due to the cost of hotel expenses. The rate at the hotel reserved for National Delegates is currently $500 a night. Aside from logistics…It’s very important to me that you know that I understand what I am asking of you and I value it beyond words. I grew up with a single mother, faced adversity living in poverty-stricken apartment-row neighborhoods, as a minority (Hispanic), I learned early on about inequity while not only being female, but a lesbian, and I am a first generation college graduate. If anyone understands that money doesn’t grow on trees, it’s me. Having said that, I am more than grateful for any size contribution, because truly EVERY bit helps. Also, there are other ways to help me. If you wish to help me, but absolutely cannot contribute monetarily, I ask that you’d please consider sharing this page with others you may know or Facebook groups that you may belong to. Also, if you have services that you are willing to donate please contact me as that may also be a huge help to me during this journey. Again, I am so humbled by this experience and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. It is my sole desire to attend the Democratic National Convention to represent Nevada’s Congressional District 3 proudly, and with an extreme dedication to my fellow neighbors, Nevadans (LGBT, Latinos, Millennials, Students, Females), and democrats. Making certain that OUR voices are heard, and defending OUR vote is my top priority. Making history is hard work, but together working hard we can live history in the making. Please join me in the effort, and DEAL ME IN!…happily ever after. **Please note that any excess funds raised will go to other National Delegates in need of financial support and/or the DNC.**Lastly, my journey will be documented both live and post, please follow the experience with me.

I've started this GoFundMe to help my cousin Michael Caputo and his family. The Democrats in the House of Representatives have him in their crosshairs again about this bogus Russia investigation. This time, he's had enough. He just announced that he won't cooperate with the House Judiciary Committee investigation that just started - and he's going to be racking up some legal fees. AGAIN!Actually, Michael is my husband Greg's cousin. They grew up together since they were in Junior High. When they graduated high school, Greg went into the Air Force and Michael enlisted in the Army. Nowadays, they're inseparable. Greg and I are also godparents to Ana Sofia, Michael and Maryna's six-year-old daughter. Their daughters are very special.Greg and I are huge Trump supporters, but we stay out of politics. I work in retail; Greg works in the defense industry. We've been so proud of Michael, fighting the good fight for our President and our country on the 2016 campaign and today on national television. And we were proud to contribute to his legal fund last summer when he appeared before the House, Senate and Mueller investigations. In fact, 8,500 people donated to his fund. Testifying as a witness - not a target or a subject, just a witness - Michael incurred nearly $200,000 in legal costs. Since the GoFundMe covered those costs, he was able to help several other Trump associates pay their legal fees, too. Now the Mueller investigation is ending (after finding no Russian collusion, of course), but the Democrats have taken over the House of Representatives and they're starting the whole thing all over again!To begin, the House Democrats are targeting 81 people associated with President Trump! Of course, that's outrageous, but Michael is right in the middle of it. Today, he announced that he does not intend to cooperate. I don't think any of these people should - this whole thing has gotten ridiculous! - but this is going to cost a lot more money than he has left in his legal fund. A whole lot more.Frankly, I don't know how much this will cost their family, but it's at least $50,000 and I want to raise it for them. Can you help?

$5,173 raised of $5,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/river-swim-to-rage-against-cancer,"Minneapolis, MN",River Swim for Cancer Research,"Created June 11, 2017","Amidst the backdrop of the unbelievably rancorous political climate in which we are living, I believe I've stumbled upon an absolute truth upon which we can all -- democrats and republicans -- agree: Cancer Sucks.  Cancer is insidious, insipid and indiscriminate. It knows no bounds and no one is immune. Right now I pray each morning for five people I know who are bravely battling the scourge; I am certain that with even a little sleuthing on my part, I could add a few dozen more. If that is you, I am sorry and I salute you. This past Christmas I lost two dear friends to cancer and it is in their honor that I am attempting to complete END-Wet, the longest swimming race in North America at 36 miles in length. I tried this swim two summers ago with my dear friend Lance Maly kayaking at my side. From a pre- and in-race strategy perspective we did everything possible that could be done wrong and we stopped at mile 24, two-thirds of the way through the race after more than six hours in the water; it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Sadly, Lance is one of the two friends who lost his battle with cancer and I endeavor to finish this year, with his name emblazoned on my cap. The other name on my cap will be that of Tim Daly. When I showed up at the U of MN my freshman year he was a mythic figure. A former state high school champion, he was big, strong and without question the best swimming “racer” I ever saw. He was not a graceful swimmer, instead choosing to thrash the water into submission with a fury. When he passed away on Christmas Eve, he may have been less mythic and forceful physically, but spiritually he was just as vibrant as I remember him being more than 30 years ago. So too was Lance. His caring and concern for others as he prepared to cross over on January 2nd was humbling, awe-inspiring and a daily lesson on how to die with dignity and grace. Cancer may have robbed both men of their physical stature, vitality and strength, but it did not put even a small dent in their respective toughness, tenacity or tenderness.  I was able to spend some time with each of them in the days leading up to their deaths and am so, so grateful. Tim’s final words to me were, “Love ya’ Danny Boy” and Lance’s much the same (without the Danny Boy). Both men left behind loving, families and countless friends and they died much too young. Lance at 50 and Tim would have been 59 on Father’s Day. So why do I think I can do this this time, after failing so spectacularly Two years ago? I don’t have a great answer to that question other than I think I want it more this time? And maybe, if I learned anything from my previous failure, I can intelligently avoid the crippling mistakes. I also know that I will have two more Angels in heaven with more than a passing interest in my progress. I will also have a more robust crew alongside me to keep me company, and to keep me motivated.  So I am asking for your support, financial or otherwise. I know you are all barraged with fundraising requests and I have no expectations for any of you. Whether you can give or choose not to will not impact our relationship. I am an adult and don’t give to every request I receive either.  But if you do give you are not giving for me, and frankly you’re not even giving for Lance or for Tim. You are giving for someone YOU know who needs YOUR prayers, blessings, support and whatever dollars you can scrape up to help fund Cancer Research. As I said at the outset: Cancer Sucks and maybe, just maybe with this effort we can all make it suck just a little less. Thank you."

My name is Omero Lara. I currently reside in Lubbock, Texas and I was elected as the National Delegate from Senate District 28, supporting Senator Bernie Sanders. We did it, 28, but “the struggle continues.”As a graduate student, I survive on a teaching assistant stipend to get through the month, but this Convention is so important to me that I am laying myself on the line and asking for any help you can give me.The hotel alone will be over $2000 for the entire stay during the last week of July. Round-trip plane tickets need to be thrown, food is a must, and it's always good to have an emergency fund.But with grassroots efforts, I know we can make it happen. Bernie never depended on SuperPAC money, but shattered records for individual and small donations; people came together and put whatever they could to a cause they believe in.Will you support my cause?Why Bernie Sanders? During this election cycle, Bernie Sanders’s enthusiasm has generated hope among millions of Americans and has transformed contemporary American politics. His message has resonated with young supporters that will become essential for the future of the Democratic Party. Like many of you, I firmly believe that Bernie Sanders is a once-in-a-lifetime candidate, who possesses authenticity, virtue and who has always fought from the heart. Our agenda offers the opportunity to transform American politics from a system controlled by greed into one that inspires the best of humanity.Why support me? As my endorsement from West Texans for Bernie Sanders and the Official Texans for Bernie Sanders organizations have shown, I want to contribute to a political system that will empower all Americans to thrive in a society that is truly fair and just. Though I have always voted Democrat, I had never been politically engaged. The Political Revolution changed that for me. Like many Americans, I was cynical about politics, but Bernie has given people like myself the optimism to act, and not just to vote. That is the essence of what this campaign is addressing. The message of this movement is about restoring hope and bringing new vibrant individuals into the political process. Help me be one of those individuals at what promises to be a momentous occasion in American history.My National Delegate Campaign Facebook Page "

My name is Charlotte Brandt and I live in Eugene, Oregon. On June 18th, at the Oregon Democratic Convention, I was elected to be an at-large delegate alternate for Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention. Travel costs to go to Philadelphia in July, 2016, are  estimated to be an average of $4,500 which includes airfare, hotel, food and other travel incidentals for almost a week.This is my first foray into being a delegate for a presidential candidate. I am a life-long Democrat and have been voting since 1972. I have NEVER been this excited about a candidate before! I took early retirement two years ago for medical reasons and am now living on Social Security, so my sources for funds are limited. I hope you will support me in my life-changing endeavor to participate in the process of our democracy in action. Whether you are a Bernie supporter or not, I ask that you consider donating what you can. Every little bit helps.
Should I be called upon as a voting delegate, my votes will be consistently for Bernie. Even if he releases his delegates to vote for another candidate, I will STILL vote for him. 
It is difficult to explain how important this effort is to me. I have always been an ardent believer in the power of a person's vote. I spent the better part of a year with Lane County for Bernie Sanders helping to lead a team that registered hundreds (some say thousands) of voters for our primary last May.  We like to think that this effort had a lot to do with Bernie winning Lane County by 20%. The power of this movement, the Political Revolution, is gaining momentum and I'm so excited to be on this ride.Thank you so much!!"

For 12 countries including the US, making up 40% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) the TPP would be a disastrous trade agreement giving 600 of the world's largest corporations the power to sue taxpayers and entire governments for lost profits if any laws are passed which affect their bottom line. If we were to ban as a nation, Syngenta’s harmful atrazine for example, under the TPP Syngenta would be able to sue the United States for lost profits in a special corporate court! I was just invited to help organize and speak at the 'We Are Seeds Rally to Label GMOs and Stop TPP Now!' during the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, July 27th at FDR Park in Philadelphia next week. With tens of thousands of demonstrators in town and many of the most politically involved Democrats and activists in the country, this is a huge opportunity to bring light to these difficult issues we face. I will be able to work with organizers and leaders of our movement from around the country to stop the TPP and for true and transparent GMO Labeling. We just got the permits so we just put up the event up so you can check it out at: http://bit.do/WeAreSeedsIt is time for Hawaii born President Obama to be accountable to Hawaii and to United States citizens and veto this fake GMO labeling bill we call the DARK Act (S764.) Obama must recognize the damages of corporate control and cease the advance of TPP. He has so far failed to bring justice for environmental health to Hawaii and we hope that in his final days as President that he will leave a legacy of aloha. Aloha never means poisoning your neighbors, lying to them, stripping their rights to protect themselves, or concealing what is in their food. Unfortunately, in the middle of election season in Hawaii as a grassroots organizer, I cannot afford to get to Philly on my own so I will need your help! Airfare is ranging from about $1500-$2000 and this website takes 7.9% so I am asking for $2k + the percentage GoFundMe takes. I have just a couple of days to raise at least $2,000 for my airfare which rises every day or I cannot purchase my ticket. I will have to miss a week of work and $2k will not cover my expenses, meals, or stay in Philly, so if you want to donate past my goal of $2,000 I absolutely will not object and thank you in advance for your consideration. Any excess I do not use in Philly will support my grassroots work back home. I understand there are a lot of amazing candidates and causes that require our attention, but if we all just pitch in a little bit, we can do this! We are a skin of our teeth, seat of our pants, bottom of the ninth, Hail Mary team on Hawaiian time up against the powerful corporate establishment so, I think we can do this! Would not be the first miracle I have seen for justice.I am hoping to fly out this Saturday, July 23rd so I can help cover the events, and report back home to the grassroots environmental and good food nation about what is going on in Philadelphia and the continental U.S. I will also be reporting live throughout the week for Viva Bernie via livestream, and you will be able to follow via FB.com/VivaBernie2016Please consider making a contribution and sharing this information throughout your networks to help me raise the airfare ASAP! If you are able to help, I do appreciate it very much because I cannot go if I cannot raise the airfare and time is of the essence. Don’t worry I will be back soon to keep helping with Hawaii elections! Mahalo nui for your consideration and malama pono. Best Ever, Nomi CarmonaP.S. (Hawaii Early Walk-In Registration & Voting is August 1st-11th and the Primary is August 13th voters! Time to clean House.)Help spread the word!P.S.S. WHY MUST I GO TO THE DNC IN PHILLY:This is why I must go to Philly and represent Hawaii, our people and our cause on the largest political stage this year.Our community has worked tremendously hard to pass several laws which would provide pesticide disclosure, buffer zones around schools, homes and hospitals, and environmental and health impact monitoring to protect ourselves from the experimental, agrichemical intensive GE agriculture here. However, these companies are suing against these laws in three out of four Hawaii counties for the right to spray toxic poisons next to our schools, homes and hospitals, without disclosure, without health or environmental impact testing. Monsanto and the chemical cartel prefer to sue rather than comply with mandated disclosure and tell us what massive amounts of undisclosed restricted use pesticides, environmental contamination and genetic experimentation is occurring in our communities. Disclosure means scientists can monitor impacts, and Doctors can treat patients exposed to pesticides, it would help us see more precisely what is causing the illness so many residents attribute to the chemical companies. Though many doctors, residents, environmentalists and Hawaiians have serious concerns regarding increasing birth defects, public and environmental health and our land, air and water - we still have no protection from the GE companies because of the ongoing litigation. The companies have given over half a million dollars to our elected officials and engaged in a high powered greenwashing campaign to prevent us from protecting ourselves by rule or law. Syngenta alone exposes our children to dangerous pesticides up to 16 times a day, 65% of days per year on average. We are already experiencing the loss of ability to protect our life, health and property here in GMO Ground Zero due to some of the companies contracted into the TPP using litigation to prevent fair regulation. Stopping the TPP is an urgent matter for Hawaii residents and people of all the 12 countries involved in the TPP if it passes. Compounded by the embattled legal history of the illegally occupied territory of Hawaii, the TPP spells disaster and international corporate control not only for Hawaii, but for all the people that will be affected by this trade agreement. That's one of the many reasons we sprung into action to organize a widely covered protest with dozens of national organizations when the TPP negotiations were held on Maui last summer. Progress was stalled but not for long. The TPP is coming to bring abominable harm to environmental policy, human rights and American jobs unless we band together to stop it. Recently, the Congressional House and Senate passed the DARK Act, a fake GMO labeling bill S764 which awaits President Obama's signature or veto. He absolutely must veto S764 which does not even label most current GMO foods. It uses complicated QR codes which require SmartPhones and signal to identify genetically engineered food, instead of plain labeling on the package. This discriminates against those who cannot afford a SmartPhone or service, and is another attempt by these agrichemical companies and their subsequent profiteers to prevent transparency. Over 100 million rural, low income, and elderly Americans would be denied their right to know about the food they buy and feed their families. Furthermore, this bill would stop state laws which label GMOs after twenty years of failure by the federal government to label GE foods. S764 is the unlabeling of GMOs. President Obama promised to label GMOs in his first Presidential campaign, and has not been pono on that promise. He has not helped us remotely to protect Hawaii from being GMO Ground Zero or label GMO foods, so this is his last chance, he absolutely must veto S764. As an organizer, advocate and Co-Founder of Babes Against Biotech which is the largest grassroots organization in Hawaii tackling GE and pesticide issues, I have a breadth of perspective to offer on these issues. The GE seeds developed in Hawaii are exported, genetically contaminating food crops worldwide, being engineered for experimental herbicide resistance and producing pesticides. Our air, land, water and health is being heavily genetically and chemically contaminated in what is considered the endangered species capital of the world. The TPP will hurt all of us, and it must be stopped. Help me rally the country to stop it,Nomi Carmona"

I want to do something about this toxic hairclown: I want to run an anti-Trump newspaper ad in New Hampshire two days before the primary. (Because why should super PACs, corporations and labor unions have all the political advertising fun?) And I need your help. I've got a few half-page ads comped up*. (See below. ) I want to run one of them The Concord Monitor, the largest paper in Merrimack County, New Hampshire on Sunday, February 7th (the New Hampshire primary is on Tuesday, February 9th). The cost for a half-page ad that day is $1,530, and that's what I'm asking for.  To get the ad in the paper, we need to have it submitted on  Tuesday, February 2nd. So that's the deadline.Why do I want to do this? The same reason you do: You're losing sleep over what this gibbering hypocrite is doing to our already pretty messed up political system, and if you could reach out to just one person who's thinking of voting for him, and change their mind, you might get some rest. The  circulation of the The Concord Monitor is 22,000. And there are over 29,000 registered Republicans in the county. I know we can get one of them to think twice. So look at the ads, tell me what you think, and then donate $5 to help save America. * Why do all of these ads attack Trump from the right? Why not just call him a bigot?Of course he is a bigot. And so much more. But my thought process is this: The people who might vote for Trump already know about his irreponsible statements, and that's kind of why they like him: He says things no one else will say, so he must not be a regular, wishy-washy Republican. So calling him a bigot only plays to his strength as an outsider. But what will get a conservative voter to think twice is the fact that Trump is aaaanything but conservative: He really likes Democrats, Hillary Clinton and government handouts. So the ads go after that."

Hi, Codi Vierra here (again)! As the South State Regional Director for the California Young Democrats, it's my job to make sure that our local chapters are represented at the California Young Democrats meetings, the next of which is taking place in San Francisco, May 31st - June 2nd, in conjunction with the California Democratic Party Convention meeting. That's pretty far from San Diego! We're the largest region in the state at 31 chapters (the next closest has only 16!), and the vast majority of our chapters are made up of high school and college students who don't necessarily have the funds or means to participate in a lot of these meetings or events. I'm fundraising to pay for hotel rooms and transportation (again, San Francisco is pretty far from San Diego!). We're squeezing, but it still looks like it'll come out to around $115/person just for the hotel, let alone transportation, registration fees, etc. Not everyone can afford this, and it shouldn't be a barrier to participating. If we raise more than needed, then this money will go toward paying for the Summer Eboard, Tahoe Retreat, and/or Fall Convention. This money raised on GoFundMe will not be used to make campaign contributions or for other political activities. If we don't raise enough, then I'll be picking up the tab, so every bit helps!

Likewise, in defense of the Liberty Bell, we are light years ahead of the standard bell curve in terms of strategic planning and pure political prescience. Here's exactly where we stand, and precisely what we stand for, chronologically speaking (please share our Story):--------------------------------------------------------------------   ***A BATTLE PLAN IN THREE DISTINCT TIERS:***--------------------------------------------------------------------Sanders Supporters & True Believers are encouraged to freely participate in any or all phases of the battle:PHASE ONE:-Bernie continues to run, continues to win as many States (& delegates) as possible, and we continue to support him in his quixotic quest for the Democratic nomination, rigged against him not by dragons but firebreathing firebrands of the party establishment. *Update: The final primaries/caucuses [June 7th (California & five others) and June 14th (District of Columbia)] are ultimately, undeniably in the history books and done for the ages. We have fought the good fight, now on to:PHASE TWO:-Simultaneous with Secretary Clinton's coronation/ Convention speech July 28th, we will steal some thunder and launch Bernie's Write-In bid under the Democratic Socialist banner in 50 separate living room and town hall press conferences, one for each state.PHASE THREE:-We will, by any means necessary, get out the vote for Bernie's bold Write-In bid on Tuesday, November 8th!HERE'S HOW it all started:WHEN TRUE Patriots stood like sentinels on the emerald greens of Lexington and the embattled bridges of Concord all those years ago, no one paused to count the bullets or the ballots. They just did their job, amidst a fusillade of dissent in the midst of the maelstrom.NOW, WE STAND in a similar storm, in the aftermath of ""Armageddon Tuesday"" (that dark day March 15th when Secretary Clinton captured a fivefold primary victory and collectively rammed a bitter pill down the throat of a nation). This is not a time for choking -- this is a time for action.AT EXACTLY one minute to midnight that same evening, another (more secret) vote was taken, of all places in a secluded back room of a Key West cafe in the shadow of the Hemingway House. The verdict, etched on the back of napkins and scratch paper, was unanimous: 23-0, so said a blue-ribbon panel of movers & shakers, progressive policymakers, and just plain common (and uncommon) citizens gathered out of concern for the fate and course of a nation. It is time to set a new course and steer away from tepid, turbulent waters; thus, (the newest) New Deal is struck, and the Democratic Socialist Party IS formed, just in time for the November election.I AM Dr. Dave Johnson of Lakeland, Fla. I was at that historic summit and strategy session and have been selected to serve as National Party Chairman (likely because I have the least ""responsible"" or demanding job duties among the top-tier, influential peers of progressivism who were gracious enough to welcome me into their midst, via my credentials as a national blogger with ""The Mighty Pen""). I have agreed to take an extended leave of absence from my associate professor post at Thomas Paine College through November, and beyond, in order to shepherd Sen. Sanders straight to the finish line in full-time fashion.THIS PRIMARY Season was rigged: You know it, and I know it. The so-called superdelegates have seen to that [at the time of this writing, well after Armageddon Tuesday and in the wake of the final District of Columbia primary June 14th, Queen-to-be Hillary Rodham Clinton bested Bernie Sanders in the total delegate count by some 2,800 to 1,900. However -- and this is a big ""however"" -- minus the oligarchy-laced superdelegates of super privilege, the count would stand at 2,219 to 1,832, an easily fixable gap of a mere 387 delegates]. Bold, bombastic Bernie clearly had ""juice,"" and momentum: At one tactically thrilling juncture in the vexing vortex and eye of the storm near the midpoint of the caustic campaign, he valiantly won EIGHT of10 key primaries & caucuses; he soon followed that up with a surprise victory in the heartland of Indiana on May 3rd; a total triumph in the coal country of West Virginia on May 10th; and, then, another stab at the heart of soul-sucking, vampire-classical Democrats May 17th by nearly winning Kentucky & by dominating in Oregon.  But the soul-less superdelegates never stopped singing their siren's song. They cantankerously continued to break bad, 92 percent-to-8, in the wrong direction. Paradoxically and painstakingly, even when Bernie ""won,"" he lost [case in point: Wyoming, April 9th, with 56 percent of the vote, but only a tepid 7-7 Draw in awarding of actual delegates]. Make no mistake: The ""fix"" is in. The fight is on ... Write-In, Right On.IT'S TIME to do some fixing of our own. A very wise man once said, ""Any plan is better than no plan."" Here's ours:1. Click the ""Donate"" icon today and give FIVE DOLLARS, the minimum amount allowed by GoFundMe (in the true spirit of The Bern);2. Volunteer NOW (in your home state and hometown) to spread the word of the ""new kid on the block"" led by a proud, patriotic Old Man, master and mentor, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Get the word out about the newly-formed Democratic Socialist Party doing battle in November. Your humble donations will be specifically used as seed money to set up satellite offices and separate party websites in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (thus, the 50 x $100 equation, equalling our efficient $5,000 grassroots budget) [we didn't yet factor-in D.C., since our analysts figured it would be painfully easy to scrape up a hundred bucks in small change off the streets and in the alleyways daily where your petulant, spoiled Congressmen toss dice and play craps with YOUR cash]. To volunteer as State Chairman (there will be 50), simply respond here in this portal in the Message section; unless you are Charles Manson (lol), state chairmen will be installed on a first-come, first-serve basis.  The fight is on while the smoke still hangs heavy on the battlefield. The time is NOW to get this pure and patriotic project off the ground and creatively cultivate its gallant groundswell of grassroots support. All monies collected will be funneled directly into the support system for the Democratic Socialist Party's array of 50 offices and websites targeting November.3. Vote for Senator Sanders and this sacred cause and this Movement on NOVEMBER 8th by marking his name as a Write-In candidate for President. YOUR VOTE WILL STILL COUNT, in every respect.We simply don't have the luxury of time right now to register or gain complex ballot access in each and every state. By direct and dedicated strategy, Sen. Sanders will be running dually as a Write-In Independent AND the designated candidate of our newly-formed Democratic Socialist Party. This is a time for new ideas and steadfast, strident ideals -- not the old days and old ways. The time is now.""But,  wait!"" you ask. ""Won't I be hurting the nation at large by siphoning votes away from Secretary Clinton and inadvertently aiding demagogue Donald Trump?""I'M GLAD you asked.WE ARE NOT new to the panorama of politics and public policy. I hold a dual Ph.D. in public policy and comparative religion; a masters of public administration; and, a bachelor of arts degree in political science. Since the tender age of nine, I have worked in national, state and local political campaigns, all in the name of public service. Additionally, I have logged four decades of work and witness as an investigative journalist. Here's what my inside intelligence currently reveals:TRUE, HARDCORE ""conservatives"" deep within the bowels and infrastructure of the Republican Party are already hard at work setting up THEIR own alternative candidate for November.  It is no secret they are not pleased with the lion-lamb Trump. This will be an American presidential race like no other, and it will be a four-'man' race -- among Hillary, Trump, Sanders, and the fourth ""real"" Republican yet to be chosen. Our current (up-to-the-minute) investigation reveals Rick Perry and/or Rand Paul are in the white heat of complex negotiations with the third-place Libertarians or the (fifth-place) Constitution Party, with Florida Gov. Rick Scott as a potential running mate. Condoleezza Rice, along with perennial blueblood/retread Mitt Romney, have also been mentioned. *[Update: Gov. Perry has recently flipflopped on this pure position and has, apparently, fallen under the spell that is hard to quell, even going so far as to endorse The Trumpster. Further, the Constitution Party at its April 16th Convention somewhat surprisingly nominated Memphis ambulance chaser/right wingnut attorney Darrell Castle. The Libertarians, for their part, over Memorial Day weekend in Orlando recycled former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, who is already drawing a 10-percent share (or more) in national polls.] One of these spoilers will ultimately emerge to do final battle in the four-pronged assault that will surely be a November to remember. This race like no other will come down in the end to Hillary, Trump, Sanders and an ultra-conservative yet to be named. Mark it down (& write it in). **[Additional Update: Lacking the moral compass & testicular fortitude to strap on the armor and do battle themselves, it appears for all the world that Romney & Ryan & Co., i.e., the ""real Republicans,"" are MORE than willing to allow Right-leaning Libertarian Gary Johnson to act as the de facto fourth candidate, thus doing all the dirty work. In this scenario, perhaps the Final, the 4-'man' race comes down to Trump vs. Hillary vs. Bernie vs. Johnson. I reiterate, we live in Interesting Times.]WE MUST get these offices and these websites set up NOW. Time is of the essence. November 8th will be here before you know it.ON THE EVENING of July 28th in the City of Brotherly Love -- when Queen-to-be Hillary claims her party crown at the Democratic National Convention/coronation lovefest -- OUR 50 state chairmen, at that very moment, will launch 50 separate press conferences dotting the neighborhoods, humble homes, and town halls of this great nation. Their message, plain and simple? The Bern continues! This is a fire that will just not go out, much like the cogent, crystal-clear campfires of freedom that burned before the Iroquois Confederacy ever even thought of meeting the Founding Fathers. The Fire of Freedom shall never die.These ashes and embers of the American Dream are not hastily assembled nor scraped together at random. The Democratic Socalist Party has covered all the bases: EVEN IF Sen. Sanders as a loyal Democrat somehow chooses to decline our draft, ALL WRITE-IN VOTES FOR BERNIE SANDERS WILL BE COUNTED NOVEMBER 8th, with or without his ""permission."" Our party's top-notch legal team present at that key Key West midnight meeting on March 15th has already thoroughly researched this intricate, malleable matter of federal election law: A living public figure is not required to ""consent"" to receive Write-In votes for President of the United States. Thus, The Movement continues, inexorably and indelibly. It can neither be stopped nor erased. It has already been written in the stars, and in the hearts of the American People. Senator Sanders successfully won 23 states in the spirited primary/caucus season; on into November, he can win many more. This is not a dream, but a cold, calculated reality, and the numbers bear it out:Last presidential election cycle in 2012, the fifth-place Constitution Party received just over 122,000 votes (yes, that's nationwide!) [see below]. If you do not think Sen. Sanders could amass many times that amount with one wave of his mighty hand -- and one final stroke of your voter's pen -- on the fateful day of November 8th, then I seriously question both your ability to count, and to know what counts.Table 1.1 -Complete 2012 general election results:1. DEMOCRAT (Barack Obama) 51%    65.9 million2. REPUBLICAN (Mitt Romney)   47%   60.9 million3. LIBERTARIAN (Gary Johnson)    1%      1.3 million4. GREEN PARTY (Dr. Jill Stein)   0.4%           469,6275. CONSTITUTION PARTY (Virgil Goode)  122,3886. PEACE and FREEDOM (Roseanne Barr)    67,3267. JUSTICE PARTY (Rocky Anderson)               43,0188. AMERICA'S PARTY (Tom C. Hoefling)         40,628^[Listing every party or person for president above 40,000 votes nationwide, on November 6th, 2012.]^EVERY VOTE counts. Trust me -- and our able analysts -- November 8th will feature a fierce, fractured, fomenting four-man race. In a finite field of Hillary, Donald Trump, an unnamed ultra-conservative, and Sen. Sanders, do the right thing: Do the prudent, pragmatic, purely patriotic thing. WRITE-IN SEN. BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ON NOVEMBER 8th. The fate of a nation hangs in the balance.Do it now. Donate. Volunteer. Vote. One nation. One voice. One vote.It makes a difference; it makes all the difference in the world.YOU can be that difference. Write-In. Right On.[Posted by Democratic Socialist Party National Chairman Dr. Dave Johnson, Lakeland, FL 33801. All monies collected are pledged to be spent directly promulgating Sen. Bernie Sanders' place as a Write-In candidate for President of the United States, subject to the general election of November 8th, as an alternative option to the rudimentary rigged machinations of the shameful Democratic Party of the day. All such funds will be efficiently and effectively funneled to the party's strategic array of 50 state satellite offices and affiliated informational websites, primarily located in the homes of various volunteers and appointed state chairpersons (in the event Sen. Sanders chooses to run not as a Democratic Socialist but allies specifically with a ""higher"" Party [i.e., the Green Party; or, the Justice Party], the DSP will fortuitously step in & augment the effort by spearheading ballot access/Write-In opportunities where those parties have none [in the recent '12 cycle, for example, the Greens were on the ballot in 37 states; the emerging Justice Party, in just 15. Under that swirling scenario, the Democratic Socialist Party Write-In troops will gladly & gallantly fill the gap. Further, if Sen. Sanders earns his way onto the mainstream Democratic Party ticket as vice president, we at the Democratic Socialist Party will jubilantly join the celebration [and the campaign], swiftly switch gears, and channel all our efforts and expenditures in that daunting dedicated direction). *[Update: Not to worry. :) Hillary prefers a centrist yes-man.] We are READY, no matter what the season brings. BRING on the BATTLE/Authorized fully by the Democratic Socialist Party, formed 03-15-16 in Key West, Fla., not specifically authorized nor endorsed by preferred candidate Sen.

I was elected as an At-Large National Delegate for Bernie Sanders at the Missouri Democratic Party State Convention.I will be representing Missouri by bringing the political revolution to Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention held on July 25-28. Apparently, revolutions are not cheap. Due to increased traffic and heigtened security, we have been all but told that we must stay at the hotel designated for the MO delegation. After taxes and fees, rooms will probably be close to $700 per night for at least 5 nights. I'll be sharing a room with my wonderful girlfriend and fellow National Delegate and others in order to minimize costs, but add airfare and meals into the mix and costs start to skyrocket pretty quickly! I wouldn't have campaigned for a delegate spot if I couldn't cover the costs myself, but I certainly won't say no to some help along the way.
I’ve spent much of the last year organizing for Bernie’s run to the White House. I’ve travelled hundreds of miles, made thousands of phone calls, coordinated multiple voter registration drives, lead marches, and spent weeks canvassing in St. Joseph where I knocked on hundreds of doors and put in multiple 15 hour days for the campaign. I have had an untold number of difficult conversations with voters and motivated many to check the box for Bernie in the voting booth.

I've done this because I believe that Bernie’s campaign and platform has energized longtime Democrats, progressives, and young people alike and is, in turn, creating momentum that could fundamentally transform the political landscape. I plan to take the fight for Bernie to Philadelphia as part of the new generation of energized activists determined to lead grassroots efforts for change, battle to save our planet,  and make our country more socially, culturally, and economically just.
I would appreciate your support. We all can't have corporation and SuperPACs funding our campaigns so, like Bernie, I hope to get donations from the people who have supported me on this journey and average folks who believe in the same things that Bernie has been fighting for. I'd appreciate any and all support, from $27, to $270, to $2.70. Every little bit will help.

My name is Genevieve Mina, and I am an enthusiastic young Filipina democrat from Anchorage. During the past Alaska Democratic Convention, I was elected as a National Delegate (pledged to Senator Bernie Sanders) - one of only 20 Alaskan representatives for the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, PA.About a year ago, I accidentally fell in love with local politics. Beforehand, I was afraid to commit to a political party. But, since volunteering for Ethan Berkowitz' winning Mayoral race, my newfound passion for campaigns and progressive values never disappeared. I'm now a proud Democrat. I volunteer for campaigns and non-profits with the Alaska Young Democrats, I push for civic engagement to fellow students as the acting president of the UAA College Democrats, and I am District 19's Young Democrat (one of the most diverse districts in the country)! Having the opportunity to travel to the 2016 DNC will be life-changing for me as a young, first generation Asian-American. Living in Alaska restricts my activism to the North, but I yearn for the opportunity to increase civic engagement from a national perspective. I recognize that millenials are all around me. Millenials share my same values and frustrations. But, we JUST DON'T VOTE. The opinions of both millenials and people of color are unrepresented in our government. I want to change that. We are the now.I am personally endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders because I recognize that our current political climate is unresponsive to the will of the most vulnerable in our society. Senator Sanders is the catalyst that our political system desperately needs to improve - we need to work on the engregious income inequality in our nation, and strive to serve those voices that cannot be heard. As a full-time college student, I am unable to fund this trip alone. I will be fundraising for the trip to Philadelphia until July 18th. Any support would be much appreciated to offset my own financial strains from attending university. Leftover funds will be donated to the Alaska Democratic Party. Thank you so much for reading and supporting young Democrats in the Last Frontier!BUDGET for 2016 DNC (07/24-07/28):-Housing and Registration: $2,355-Round-Trip Alaska Airlines Ticket: $1,000-Meals and Incidentals: $645-Total: $4,000"

The newsletter gives you the rundown on the most important political races across the country, with insight from candidates, activists, and experts, and gives you the tools to help the fight against Trump, the GOP, and frankly, corporate Democrats.So far, Progressives Everywhere has raised over $635,000 for progressive Democrats since early 2018, all on the power of small-dollar donations. The newsletter and stories have raised money for candidates in crucial races that helped oust bad Republicans, empower progressive challengers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and flip the balance of power in swing states, where people have spent years under brutal GOP regimes, where tax cuts for the rich have been prioritized over healthcare and education. You can see the positive results in states like Michigan, Maine, North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, and Colorado, where new Democrats have either passed big new progressive laws or at least had the numbers to stop the worst Republican tyranny.We're in what's considered an ""off"" year for election, but Progressives Everywhere is only getting busier and more ambitious. We'll be helping highlight and fund grassroots organizations and candidates for local office and legislatures where there are elections this year. That means more time spent researching, interviewing, transcribing, and writing — which in turn means doing less other work for pay. It means higher fees for newsletter services, legal protection, and other necessities.So far, this has been done entirely out of pocket. But as the project grows, that becomes less and less feasible.

$365 raised of $100,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/resistance-media-legal-fees,"Falls Church, VA",Mike Stark's Resistance Media Legal Costs,"Created April 13, 2019","[UPDATE] You won't believe what's going on in Mike's Las Vegas trial. Police and prosecutors have ""lost"" four videos related to his arrest for disturbing the peace and ""assaulting"" a GOP campaign staffer. The security camera videos from the Community Center? Gone. Two separate police body camera videos? Disappeared. The patrol car footage? Also missing. Each of these videos provide critical evidence that would prove Mike's innocence. (Of course, on the other hand, if you're the prosecutor and you have a guilty suspect, how in the world do you ""lose"" these videos?) Read more (and see Mike's video evidence) here. Mike Stark has been a fearless progressive warrior for almost two decades. And I don't use the term ""warrior"" lightly; Mike, a former Marine, has endeavored to go where few of us dare: into the belly of the Republican beast, where the crazy runs thickest.  Mike's journalism began in 2006, when racist Virginia Senator George Allen was considered by many to be the likely successor to George Bush as the next Republican nominee for President. Alas, he had to make it through his Senate race first, and to do that, he'd have to make it past Mike Stark. You all probably remember the ""Macaca incident"", but what you may not know is that the media utterly refused to ask then-Senator Allen what other racial slurs he might have used. And given that one had particular relevance in Virginia history, Mike took it upon himself to ask. Stark: ""Given what's been in the news, I think some of us at the law school have some other questions on our  mind: Have you ever used the word n******?""Allen: ""Oh. Listen...""Stark: ""Have you?""Allen: ""No.""Stark: ""You never have in your life?""Allen: ""No""Stark: ""Well, can you explain the Confederate Flag and the noose you keep in your office?""See what we mean by ""fearless""? Yes, Mike really did that.With that, Mike's career in advocacy journalism was launched. Since then, he's continued to do the work most are scared to do: show up at conservative events where he is seen as the enemy, and capture right-wingers on film so the public can learn the truth about their extreme and abhorrent views. Where the mainstream media presents an airbrushed view of conservatives and right-wingers, utterly unwilling to be honest with Americans about what the Republican Party truly has become, Mike has mad it his mission to show Americans the crazy in all its vivid hues. Remember birtherism? Of course you do. What you may not know is that birtherism became a national story largely because of Mike's work exposing Republican birthers in Congress. Mike was also the first reporter to put Republicans  on the record about family separations . And when was the last time you saw a mainstream reporter hold a Republican accountable the way Mike did with Ron DeSantis and Marsha Blackburn for their vapid and empty responses to the Parkland shooting ? Of course, when you are as effective as Mike has been, GOP liars and thugs don't take it well, or lying down. If Donald Trump and his conservative minions think the mainstream press is the ""enemy of the people,"" you can just imagine what they think of Mike Stark. We've all seen the haatred and violence directed at the media at Trump rallies. And let's not forget Montana Congressman Greg Gianforte who body-slammed a reporter, claimed he was attacked, and only admitted the truth when other witnesses came forward. That should give you an idea of what happens when Mike braves his way into Republican events to ask GOP candidates and elected officials the difficult questions nobody else has the courage to pursue.And that's why this GoFundMe page exists. Over the last year, on three separate occasions, Mike has been assaulted by Republicans, arrested under false charges, and thrown in jail three times... Just for doing his job.Yes, Mike was beaten and thrown in jail, simply for reporting on Republicans. You cannot get much more un-American than that, but that's where we are.Mike has seen our country's future if we don't fight back, and that kind of future is dark indeed. So far, Mike has been to trial and proven his innocence twice. He faces a third trial in Las Vegas next month. (see the link at the top of the page to see how far the GOP will go to finally convict Mike - police and prosecutorial misconduct in this case is a must-read).The beatings, arrests, jail time and trials come at a cost. Sure, Mike's employer picked up most of his legal fees for the first two trials, but there was still more than $5,000 Mike had to personally absorb. And unfortunately, Mike lost his job after the third arrest, and is on his own for the cost of that defense. In all, just for the criminal defense attorneys, Mike is personally on the hook for almost $10,000.But here's the thing.Mike has found a new way to fight back against the dishonest right-wing smear machine that time and again had him falsely arrested and smeared in the press. Instead of tucking his tail between his legs and giving up, Mike has filed a lawsuit against the Republican National Committee (RNC), the National Republican Congressional Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Ed Gillespie, Adam Laxalt, and seventeen other named operatives and organizations that conspired to make it impossible for Mike to continue doing his important work. But this civil lawsuit won't be free either: Mike's lawyers tell him he should raise at least $90,000 to see the case through.That's our challenge. Have you ever wondered what lurks within the email boxes of right-wing operatives? Of right-wing media smear artists? Of the committees responsible for smearing good Democrats to dishonestly win elections?Mike's lawsuit has a real chance of revealing all of that and more.Please, if you care about democracy, the rule of law, and really a free press, support Mike for what he has done, for what he will do, and for the fight Mike now has on his hands: protecting his reputation and exposing the right-wing smear machine.Please donate to this GoFundMe so Mike isn't destroyed for simply trying to get us the truth. Support Mike, for what he is aiming to learn in discovery about various Republican organizations. Support him so his two wonderful kids, Antigone & Aaron, aren't made to suffer for the sins of today's ultra-right-wing Republican Party, and so your kids can grow up in a country where freedom of the press is still a right."

My name is Brian Carolus, and on May 1st, 2016, I was elected by voters of California's Congressional District 33 to represent us the people as a California Delegate for Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention in July in Philadelphia! About Me: I was born here in the South Bay, and I grew up here, spending my entire childhood and teenage years here. I have lived in the South Bay and the 33rd district area for nearly 30 years. I have donated hundreds of dollars of my own money to Bernie's 2016 campaign, dollars that over the past year I have not always been able to afford, because I know that in my heart it is the right thing to do. I co-founded one of the largest student grassroots-activism organizations for Bernie in the country, UCLA Bruins for Bernie, and since July 2015 we have mobilized over 1,100 dedicated UCLA students and South Bay community members by tabling, canvassing in the LA area and in other states like NV and AZ, flyering, chalking, voter registration, weekly phonebanking, and now ""dormstorming"" to get students registered to vote and excited to vote Bernie Sanders. I myself have also canvassed in both NV and AZ with UCLA and with Bernie Sanders Brigade, organized barnstorms at UCLA, and monitored the NV Caucuses to ensure that there would be a fair election for Bernie there. I have done everything humanly possible over this past year to see Bernie Sanders become our president, and now I am taking my fight, our fight, that we have waged together all the way to the Democratic National Convention! Many people ask me why I am a supporter of Bernie Sanders, and why I care so much about this fight. I have been a registered Democrat for 9 years since the age of 18 when I could first apply to vote. I grew up in an extremely progressive household, which partially inspired my interest in politics in the first place.  I first learned about Bernie in January 2015 long before many others even knew who he was, months before he declared, and I realized that virtually every position he had completely agreed with my views, and it stunned me. No candidate has ever been so close to my views, and in my opinion more ethical than anyone, in my lifetime. I can comfortably say that his views mirror mine on virtually every issue- it that and his incredible compassion, integrity and honesty, courage and heart that make me such a strong and fiery supporter of Bernie's.Please help me continue my fight to the National Convention by making a contribution. When you donate, you are helping me afford the high costs of being able to go the Democratic National Convention In Philadelphia from July 25-July 28, 2016.

I support proper foreign policy and humanitarian goals essential to American ideals.I believe in fair trade and support strong trade agreements with partners and allies around the world.A sustainable economy with fair access to opportunity at a time of rising anxiety about the implications of artificial intelligence-driven automation's is essential for our nation’s future. I passionately believe in the principle of inter-generational responsibility in this regard.I support our military and Veterans’ access to affordable healthcare, education, public safety, and civic discourse.I support the Second Amendment and the people’s right to responsible gun ownership. I believe in a rational and reasoned approach to gun legislation that can improve the safety of all Americans without infringing on the right to bear arms established by the Second Amendment.To maintain and improve the quality and nutritional value of our nation’s food supply, government policies and programs must include the needs and voices of small and family-owned farms, ranches, and fishing operations – the core of rural and small-town economies – and must be included in all policy decisions that impact our national and local food supply.I am for running in the 2020 Election for a better El Paso, Texas, and America.Unity: We are all Americans first, and members of political parties second. We have more in common with each other than we have differences with each other.  E. Pluribus UnumUnity means that we will never deliberately divide Americans and sow fear by stigmatizing people who look different, worship differently, have a differing opinion from ours, or any group, or for any other reason. It means we will never indulge in identity politics and blame-game victimization ploys. We reject all forms of bigotry and exclusion, and we affirm the primacy of conscience and free speech as integral to basic human dignity.Community: We believe in the primacy of local politics. We believe that we must return as appropriate resources and decision authority to our states and localities in order to foster levels of democratic participation that can fulfill the Founders’ vision of genuine self-government. We believe that all politics is indeed ultimately local, and that democratic politics must be embedded in the social realities of face-to-face human relationships.Our communities are under tremendous stress at a time of massive and rapid change at home and in the world. We are in the midst of a technological tsunami no less powerful than the technological shift from a predominately agricultural to an industrial society some century and a half ago. These epic transitions affect our culture and social order, and of course, our politics with them.We have a choice: We can join together to make the passage safely to the next American future, or we can squabble our way to national collapse, as tragically occurred once in our past, in a civil war. Responsibility: Citizens of a Republic have a civic duty to participate in maintaining a decent social and political order. Many Americans have come to assume that the government grants people rights as it grants them certain benefits. But the premise of the Constitution is that sovereignty resides with the people; it is the people who grant rights to the government, and not the other way around. This core American principle of democracy requires citizens to act responsibly in participatory self-government. It requires that they educate themselves about the issues of the day, and that they organize to make representation for their interests both inside the political system and in society generally. A passive citizenry deserves whatever government it gets, a tragedy we now see playing out before our eyes.For too long El Paso has been under the leadership of those whose have an agenda for self-serving political gain. Because of this El Paso is now one of the highest taxed districts in the nation, one of the slowest growing major cities across America, and is  ranked number 14 in the nation for cities with the highest poverty rate with almost 10% of households with an income of $10,000 or less and with an average household salary of only $41,000. Although this does paint a dismal picture of our situation, fortunately, we do not have to keep it that way. My experience working with many different cultures and economies has given me the experience to help El Paso turn the corner for a better future.During my 29 years of military service, I have been to 5 continents and 15 countries, to include El Salvador, Honduras, And Columbia. All around the world I have seen how politicians manipulate their citizens for their own personal gain. Unfortunately, the same game is being played right here at home in El Paso. Ask yourself why your taxes continue to rise and never go down. Ask yourself why no matter how much you protest or speak out, the issue is never resolved. Ask yourself why you are working harder today but cannot seem to build a solid savings account. The answer is a simple one. The government is not concerned with you or your family's best interest. They only seem to care when it's election season.My promise to El Paso is one of hope. My goal is to give the government back to you. As an Independent representative, I answer directly to you, not to a political party that exists for big banks and corporations. It's time to realize that neither Democrats or Republicans are here to serve our families. It's time for a change.If you want a brighter future for your family, a city that can provide opportunity for your family's success, and a place that your children can thrive to reach their full potential, then I ask you to consider all of what you have just read before you place your vote for the person who will represent you in Washington D.C. El Paso is beautiful city built on the pride of a rich Hispanic culture. The only obstacle preventing El Paso from achieving true greatness is our current government. It's time to replace the government that has failed to bring prosperity to our city for the past 30 years and more. It's time to vote for a representative who desires the same for his family as you do for yours. It's time to show America what the people of El Paso can accomplish when the government is on their side. El Paso, the choice is yours. Keep the same government and hear the same empty promises with the same empty results or make a change that will give us a chance at real prosperity. It's time to leave behind the days of poverty and a stagnant economy. Only together can we solve the problems that have plagued El Paso for generations. Only together can we take El Paso to another level!Sincerely,Sam Williams"

$2,768 raised of $5,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/253er3zw,"Seattle, WA",Chad to Philadelphia for Bernie,"Created May 22, 2016","My name is Chad Lupkes, and I’m asking for your support to finance my trip to Philadelphia as a CD Delegate from the 7th Congressional District of Washington, as well as your help over the next few years. This Political Revolution goes beyond 2016, and we’ve always known that.I was born in Seattle and raised in Kent. I’ve lived in the Puget Sound my entire life, except while I was in the Navy. I owned a progressive bookstore and gift shop in Everett for three years in the 1990’s.  While I was there, I started the Everett/Snohomish County chapter of Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG).  I went to a private university to rack up school loan debt that I’m still paying off.One of my classes in early 2003 was State and Local Government, and one of the assignments was to attend a meeting of a political organization. I had not been cognizant of how the party was structured, so I discovered that I lived in the 46th LD, and that the meeting of the 46th LD Democrats was the next night. I attended, and it was really, really “interesting”. Supporters of Lyndon Larouche were standing on chairs singing protest songs because their candidate wasn’t being taken seriously enough to be invited to the Democratic candidate debates. The police pulled them outside, and I volunteered with the party immediately. I started looking at how to improve, i.e. build from scratch, a website that would actually accomplish what they needed done during the run-up to a Presidential Caucus cycle. I had a lot to learn, so I started by transcribing the entire PCO Handbook into a website. You can still find that site on my Seattle Webcrafters domain.Then my wife felt some lumps in my neck, and I went to get them checked out. The Nurse Practitioner at my doctor’s office told me to sit tight and she made my doctor drop everything. He then got on the phone and made an appointment for a CAT Scan across the highway, immediately. After a few days, I had a biopsy scheduled at Swedish Ballard. And a day or so later, I got a confirmation phone call saying that I had Stage II-B Hodgkin's Lymphoma.I had started working for Nordstrom in 2000, and I had their health care insurance. I’m really glad that I did. When the EOB’s started coming in the mail, we realized that without that insurance, we would have had to sell our home to pay those bills. Then I heard someone talking about how 47 Million people in our country, in MY country, didn’t have any health insurance at all. They couldn’t even make an appointment with a doctor, let alone get anything else. That was Howard Dean, and that was my wake up call. I have been Single Payer or Bust ever since.While going through chemotherapy and radiation treatments, I continued to build the website of the 46th, along with a few others. I started reading history about how the political evolution of the Democratic and Republican Parties have gone over the entire history of our country. I read about the Progressive Era and the Long Gilded Age, and started really putting the pieces together about what had gone wrong. And how to put it right. I got more involved.I caucused for Howard Dean at the 2004 Precinct Caucuses. I ran for PCO. And lost, by 1 vote, to a supporter of Lyndon Larouche whom I actually never saw again. She moved away before the 2006 cycle and I was able to take the PCO position officially. In the meantime, I joined the executive board of the 46th LD as an At Large member in 2005, then became the King County Committeeman in 2007. I became the chair of the 46th in 2009, as well as vice chair of the King County Democrats, and vice chair of the Chair’s Organization.I attended the Seattle launch of Howard Dean’s Democracy for America, and helped launch the state level organization, Democracy for Washington. After several years of work trying to keep the people who had been inspired by Howard to stay engaged with the party, we realized we had been successful and folded the organization into Progressive Majority Washington. All of our members were active officers within the Democratic Party.I also helped form the Washington State Progressive Caucus, starting within the 46th LD where we had meetings the week before the district meetings in order to talk about the upcoming agenda and have a more in depth discussion about the issues, debates, votes, endorsements, and whatever else was happening in North Seattle. We actually held the first candidate forum for the position of State Party Chair in 2006 when Paul Berendt stepped down after 11 years. The members of the executive board were not sure what was happening until we invited the district chair to sit in at a meeting. He stopped worrying and started helping us.I had caucused for someone in 2008 that I choose because of the message he had been putting out. I didn’t yet know that the Edwards campaign was defunct, although we on the state steering committee knew he wasn’t going to stick with it. I had watched both the Obama and Clinton campaigns through the summer and fall of 2007, and only the Obama campaign really built a grassroots organization that I could find. When we got to the precinct caucus, I switched to Obama. But I didn’t run for national seriously because many others had done the work over the previous year, and they needed to go.After the success the Democratic Party had in 2006 in gaining back control over the US House and Senate, and the intense health care debates that seriously mirrored what had been seen in 1993, we saw 2010 coming and really couldn’t do much to stop it. Citizens United clinched it, and campaign finance reform has been a top issue of mine every since.Then the 46th had a shock. Our State Senator Scott White, who had been the district chair that attended the progressive caucus meeting in 2006, died suddenly in October, 2011. He was a good friend, mentor, former chair of the district, and someone I really wanted to see continue into higher and higher office. He had one of the largest hearts I knew, caring about everyone. His doctor never caught the fact that it was too large. The resulting contests within the 46th LD to fill his vacancy, and then the State House vacancy that came from David Frockt taking his place in the Senate, tore the district apart. At least that’s how I saw it. I didn’t have time to grieve. I ran the vacancy appointment meetings, and watched the executive board split down the middle. It burned me out. I started making mistakes during meetings, and it got to be too much. I resigned as chair, stepped away from the party, and focused on my family for a while.During this whole time I had been listening and supporting Progressive Talk radio, especially Thom Hartmann. I loved Fridays, when “America’s Congressman”, who in 2006 became “America’s Senator” would give an hour of his time to tell the truth about how things were going in Congress. Bernie Sanders never strayed off message, never gave into despair, and always gave me hope that someone, at LEAST one person in DC had my back. I knew about the Congressional Progressive Caucus, one of my good friends had worked as the Executive Director of the Progressive Congress organization. (Darcy Burner is now running for the State House in the 5th LD.) In early 2015, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do during the next caucus cycle. I looked at Martin O’Malley, and mostly liked what I saw. I wasn’t thrilled with Hillary. I knew all about the Third Way Coalition, and I really didn’t want a repeat of the 1990’s.Bernie Sanders announced his intention to run for the Democratic Nomination on April 28th. I announced on that same day that I was in. This was (is) a drop everything moment. I started the Facebook group “Washington for Bernie Sanders”. I brought in my best friend Mario Brown to start the Page and to help me build the organization. The mission was to maximize the number of delegates that Washington would send to the National Convention in Philadelphia.I worked with grassroots leaders from all over the country setting the foundations for Bernie’s domination of social media. I worked with Bernie2016.tv over the summer to capture and rebroadcast as many speeches as we could. Mario and I were asked to lead the volunteers when Bernie first came to Seattle in August. And Mario and I started doing caucus training sessions every weekend somewhere around the Puget Sound area, telling people how this could actually succeed. We were not selling the idea of Bernie Sanders as President, he was doing that just fine. What we were focused on is how the grassroots could actually win. And people responded. We have had people step up in all 10 Congressional Districts, and most counties and legislative districts. We got Votebuilder access in December, and started providing lists for people to canvass their neighborhoods. We started promoting the phone banks that were going into Iowa and New Hampshire.When staff arrived in Washington, they met with us and our team. For the very first time, a presidential campaign came in and said they wanted to amplify and magnify what we were already doing, not take over or start over from scratch. Instead of giving orders, they asked us what we needed, and then made it happen. The closer we got, the more we all focused on phone banks going into our own state. We knew what could happen if we stayed focused on positive campaigning and empowering the grassroots. But what actually happened was far and away beyond our expectations.Obama in 2008 got 67.56% at the precinct caucuses. On March 26, 2016, Bernie Sanders got 72.7%. We won every county. The lowest number was 60% in King County. We had done it. It had never been about what I could do on social media, or what Mario and I could do with trainings, it was about what everyone who was inspired could do when we worked together.I have been trying to gather delegate lists and provide them to people who need them. We’ve been doing video calls so I can answer questions from all over the state, and joining in the campaign calls. Members of our team built the website fileforpco.com which is promoting the idea of keeping the Political Revolution alive after the Convention and after November. We’ve done this before. We can do it again. We can built a better tomorrow.I want to tell this story in Philadelphia. I want to listen and talk with people from all over the country, people given hope that if we work together we can really achieve a better tomorrow. People excited by the possibilities of political action, not disappointed by what the corporate media tells them to think. I need your vote to make that happen. I need your help to spread the word and tell people that this was never just about one candidate, one office, and one election cycle.I know how to work within the Democratic Party to enact change. I’ve done it. I know how to build external party groups and use them to expand the outreach efforts of the party to the progressive movement as well as push issue positions and policy ideas from the larger movement into the party. I’ve done it. I know how to teach people to answer the three core questions of an activist: “What decision is being made?”, “Who is making that decision?”, and “How can I influence that decision?” Answers to those three questions are what drive change.In 2008 the slogan was “Yes we can”. In 2016, it’s “Oh Yes We Will”. No matter what they say, we’re going to build a world that our children can grow up in. We’re going to build a future.Together."

I'm adding an additional $950 for food and incidentals. I will try to find a roommate, and adjust the goal accordingly if I find someone.I have admired Bernie for many years and began working for his campaign last July, locally with the Kenosha For Bernie group (arranging debate watch parties, canvassing, etc.) and as a “super volunteer” with the national campaign. I spend many hours a week behind the scenes in Support and Lead roles, doing data entry (processing volunteers in VAN) and interacting with the Bernie Dialer, both as Dialer  Monitor (releasing numbers for callers to connect to voters) and as Pilot a/k/a Calling Program Volunteer Coordinator, “flying the plane”. I also provided support housing for a couple of weeks to out-of-state campaign volunteers while they worked in Kenosha to deliver the county to Bernie. I walk the walk! And I love helping other people help Bernie!I possess a strong ability to “herd cats”; gathering and inspiring diverse individuals into groups and setting them on a path for a common cause. This talent would be particularly useful in a contested convention scenario, but I believe Bernie will win the nomination.

Only by posting on Facebook in the desperate hope that someone, anyone, would see her plea for help, did rescue finally come.  This is the reality for a beautiful member of our community;  she had taken out a restraining order on an old boyfriend who frightened her and threatened her life.  She tried to protect herself by being safe and smart, but this monster had a plan.  What followed was hours of rape, torture and eventually, multiple slashes to her face and body.  As a therapist, she tried her best to talk the man down, even while her face drained of blood from multiple slashes and her nose nearly severed.  She was near death when her dogs began to bark.  The attacker left the room to see why, and this brave and amazing woman grabbed the only thing near, her iPad, and locked herself in the bathroom.  Not having a phone, she took to social media, pleading for someone to call 911, posting a picture of herself to prove this was no joke.  Even at such a late hour, friends were online and began frantically calling emergency numbers to save her, and thankfully, saved she was.  Miraculously she made it to the hospital where multiple surgeries and hundreds of stitches patched her face and body back together.  The attacker was caught and we can only hope he will rot in prison- but the real battle for this miraculous woman has just begun.  After seeing her face today, stitched slashes running across her face, she fell into grief, thinking herself too awful to look at; could she ever return to her job caring for others?? Was a life dedicated to providing mental health care to families and youth in need, working hand in hand with other community services to provide help to those who were helpless and hope to the hopeless over now??  She worked tirelessly for our most vulnerable age group, our youth, who depend on her to dole out loving advice, care and hope during their darkest hours. And now we need to help this amazing soul in hers.  We support our troops, our police, our firemen, our nurses, our community members that uplift our souls saved our lives and care for us when there's no one else- we call them our HEROS.  Rarely do we have the chance to give back to our heroes, to show them that we do appreciate, love and honor them, to show them THIER LIVES MATTER.  Now we can help this heroic woman in her urgent time of need. We are asking for $175,000 to use towards the extensive plastic surgery needed to repair this beautiful person's face. She didn't deserve what happened to her, and she doesn't deserve to live a life reminded of the brutality done against her every time she faces a mirror.  Evil cannot be allowed to triumph!!We are not going to post pictures-trust that it is just too graphic. In the attack, her face was slashed repeatedly, nose nearly severed, tendons and nerves destroyed, bones broken.  It is also inconceivable to expect a victim of such brutality to go back to the home where she was attacked and sleep in the bed where she was tortured, so some of the funds will go towards setting her up a new household while she recovers.  She saved her life using Facebook, now we can help save her future.  Thank you all so much for the outpouring of love and support you have shown already your generosity means more than you will ever know and our appreciation is endless for that.http://fox40.com/2015/05/15/woman-uses-facebook-to-escape-attacker/http://m.appeal-democrat.com/news/prior-to-attack-she-feared-for-her-life/article_2403be3a-fdec-11e4-932f-ab3dcfdb6758.html?mode=jqmhttp://m.appeal-democrat.com/news/prior-to-attack-she-feared-for-her-life/article_2403be3a-fdec-11e4-932f-ab3dcfdb6758.html?mode=jqmhttp://m.appeal-democrat.com/news/prior-to-attack-she-feared-for-her-life/article_2403be3a-fdec-11e4-932f-ab3dcfdb6758.html?mode=jqm"

UPDATE THE THIRD:  (the second update is on the update tabs if you want to see it)

I'm in the race and running fast!   For the last month I've been criss-crossing the state, speaking with every group that I can, knocking on doors, talking to people in the line at the grocery store and basically doing everything I can to get the message out.  When I started this race I thought it would be a simple matter of repeating that felons need the right to vote for three months.  Since then I've realized that what I'm offering is a lot simpler and a lot more important.

I'm publishing ALL correspondence when I'm in office.  ALL of it.  If the Secretary of State knows it, you will know it.  If I get an email, it goes on the web.  When I respond, it goes on the web.  When I get a letter or a memo, it get scanned and posted.  If somebody tells me I can't publish something, then I go on the web and tell you who told me that and what authority they have to say so.  No exceptions.  Perfect 21st century transparency.This has two major implications:

A)  There's no reason why any other official or candidate can't make the exact same promise, and in fact, some of them are starting to.  The more people I can tell about this, the more I can awaken Kentucky's latent desire to truly know what's going on, to have the information available so that we can decide for ourselves what is best for ourselves.  This is truly what I'm campaigning for.  This is what I'm accomplishing.  I'm not just offering 21st century transparency for myself, I'm asking for you to want it for yourself.  I'm asking for you to offer it.  I'm asking for you to demand it.

B)  ""The Secretary of State shall keep a fair register of and attest all the official acts of the Governor""--Kentucky Constitution, Section 91.If it's in the office, it's official.  This means that I will use literally every power at my disposal, granted to me by the Kentucky Constitution, to publish literally everything that I can from the Governor's office.  No more secret deals.  If I'm working with a governor who respects the people, like Young or Adkins, then I can promise the most transparent state government in the history of this and any other state.  If I'm working with an adversarial governor, like that low-rent bargain-basement teacher-hating hack we have right now, then I will be in his office, in his face, every single day, saying, ""What's that?  Can I print that?  What's on this post-it note?  You don't mind that I'm livestreaming this, do you?  You better not.""

So please, donate, distribute, and volunteer.  When you donate, you help me amplify this message.  You help me tell everybody in Kentucky, ""Hey, you want this too.  This is what we all want.  Ask for what we want.""

 

Oh and also I've decided to design my campaign to be perfectly congruent with libertarian and socialist principles, because I can.  I'm running for an executive position without budget authority, which makes it easier, but the way I'll run the office will be in no way against the principles of either the libertarian* or socialist** movements; I'm running to return power to the people, I refuse all coercion, I refuse all secrecy, I am all for minimizing regulation and government overreach whenever possible, I will not in any way attempt to increase the budget of my office, and my voting rights platform is exponentially more ambitious and egalitarian than all the other candidates on both sides combined.  I'm still running as a Democrat, I'm just a Democrat who's willing to admit that libertarians and socialists exist and that we are willing to work to earn their votes.

I edited the campaign goal from $500 to $2500 because I could do some really cool stuff with about $2000.  Time's running  a bit short for my campaign to make a million dollars but I'm doing well with what I've got.

In the interests of transparency, here's what the last $90 went to:

Gas money for Boyd, Madison, Clark, Rowan, Powell, Bullitt (twice), Jefferson, (three times), Scott, Woodford, Franklin (three times) and soon Owen, Oldham, and Fulton counties.About a hundred tiny plastic Kentucky tokens (biodegradable PLA plastic, contact me on the website (s4sos.politicsky.org) if you want one)$20 of Facebook ads (hopefully starting today, Facebook has a weird verification process for political candidates, I'll let you know how it goes)

*  To the extent that libertarians agree with each other about their own principles.

**  The same as the libertarians except far moreso.

 

------------------

UPDATE:  I'm in the race!  Thank you very much for your donations, in the interest of transparency I'll tell you what I used them for:

$500 for filing fee$20 for business cards$25 for new toner cartridges for the printer

I am running because I want to stand on stage and talk about early voting, re-enfranchising felons, ranked-choice voting, modern voting security, and government transparency.

I am in the Democratic primary.  There are at three other people running.  The winner will almost certainly be the person who spends the most money.  Let's not have any illusions about that.  But running has a value all its own.  A good campaign is worthwhile in and of itself.

I can't promise that I'll win; that will depend on donors, voters, and fate.  But I can make darn sure that we talk about early voting, about same-day party registration for our closed primary state, about returning the right to vote to felons, about reforming first-past-the-post voting, about blockchain voting security, about the responsibility for perfect governmental transparency in every department, and about the unique genius of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

It costs $500 to run for office in Kentucky.  All donations up to $500 were be used for the filing fee, all donations past $500 will be used for promotion of the campaign.  I strongly intend to run the campaign with the coolest swag.My campaign web page is s4sos.politicsky.org .

Thank you very much for your consideration.

That is why I am so excited about my upcoming trip to Philadelphia for this year’s historic Democratic National Convention. I am Jan Bauer, Chair of the Story County Democratic Party of Iowa and have served in this position since 1996. However, my time in the Party dates back even further to 1980 when I was the Democratic Voters’ Program Coordinator for Story County between graduating from Iowa State University with a bachelor’s degree in political science and starting graduate school in public administration at ISU. Since then I have contributed in many different ways to elect Democrats up and down the ticket. In 1992, I worked on Tom Harkin’s presidential bid, attended the Democratic National Convention on his behalf; and then returned home to work on Bill Clinton’s successful election campaign. During the 2008 presidential caucuses, I volunteered for Barack Obama and went to the National Convention as an Obama delegate. After President Obama was elected, I continued to promote his agenda, working as a community organizer for Organizing for America. As a result, President Obama appointed me to serve as an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee in 2009. In this last caucus cycle, I supported Hillary Clinton's historic run for President of the United States; and I am thrilled to attend this year's history-making convention as an At-Large Member of the DNC, supporting Hillary Clinton. Given that the Iowa delegation wound up with an extremely expensive hotel, I have looked for alternative lodging.  Because of my mobility challenges, however, there just isn't another room available that will work for me. For thirty-some years, I have helped raise money to elect Democrats.  Candidates from the courthouse to the White House have benefited from my efforts.  I am now asking for donations to help fund my exorbitantly expensive accommodations in Philadelphia.Thank you for your support!"

Carthan repay more than $184,000 — the salary, interest and other related compensation —  he has received since being elected to that position in 2015, because the attorney general’s office said Carthan can’t legally hold the seat. Carthan told the Clarion Ledger on Monday that he was ""surprised and shocked"" when he received the demand letter. ""I didn't certify myself and I have ran five times for office,"" Carthan said. The letter, issued April 17, gives Carthan 30 days to satisfy the demand or the case will be turned over to the attorney general's office.More than 40 years ago, Carthan made national headlines when he won an election in the tiny town of Tchula to become the first black mayor in the Mississippi Delta since Reconstruction. He then went up against the town’s white elite in an extraordinary battle that ended with him being convicted of felony assault and tried for the murder of one of his political rivals.Tensions came to a head in 1980, when the police chief stepped down and Hayes engineered the appointment of a white businessman named Jim Andrews. Carthan recruited six men, including several police officers, to confront Andrews and tell him to step aside. Andrews refused and sustained minor injuries in an ensuing scuffle.The mayor was charged with assaulting a police officer who stood with Andrews that day. The officer later told reporters in a TV interview that Carthan had been set up. A white judge nonetheless sentenced Carthan to three years in prison, and Carthan was forced to leave office in 1981. Then-Gov. William Winter, a Democrat who championed racial justice, took notice. In the spring of 1983, Winter suspended the rest of Carthan’s assault sentence and sent him on to federal prison. A legal team led by former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark sought Carthan’s release, and a federal judge freed him after just eight months. We are raising funds to relaunch the Campaign to Free Eddie Carthan. The funds will be used for lawyer fees and to spread the word of the injustices in Mississippi. Your donation will not only help with lawyer fees, it will educate people around the world how Eddie Carthan was framed. People from all around the world came to Holmes County to support Eddie Carthan because they knew this was a political plot to destroy Carthan and deter other blacks hoping to seek office.

Delegates are to stay in the vicinity of the ironic Wells Fargo Center, which is very expensive. Hotels in the area have raised their prices by 400% most Sanders Delegates are young and just starting their lives making this all the more difficult. As of today I have raised $250 for this epic trip to save the country and still need $1250 to cover the costs I did not save for. When we ran to become delegates they told us we would be responsible for travel and hotel expenses however I think $2500+ is a lot to pay for our right to vote. So until we can get these laws changed and have publically funded elections, we really need the Bernie supporters to step up and help out. We are in the final stretch and on the verge of making history. Let's finish strong!  A little about Matthew:Matthew Killen came from Weatherford Texas, better known as the quarter horse and peaches Capital of Texas. Although the small town had all the charm of a Bible Belt village, the town also had all the hallmarks of big city problems. Weatherford was an excellent teacher to Matthew and a great place for people making the best future they can with what they have and the people they love. Those formidable years would shape him forever as he watched his Mom fight her way out of homelessness, literally. Anna Jerez was a karate teacher with a dream and the personal fortitude to look at herself in the mirror and tell herself she’s worth more, that she is unique and that she could help others. Her instructor Pat Burleson reached out and let her stay in a horse letting her do whatever she liked to it to make herself comfortable. One night she had a dream that her family and her students gathered all of their resources and built a giant karate dojo for them all to use. The next day she got to work putting her - vision to organizing - and invited all of her students out to help her build her dream. She told them if they helped, she would teach them karate for free, for the rest of their life and the rest, is history. Anna now lives on two acres, she owns with her husband, and now has several schools around the Dallas Fort Worth area with her now husband, Pat Burleson and Matthew’s brothers Luke and Chad Killen. During that time a lot of the home responsibilities were placed on Matthew’s shoulders as well as his other two brothers. His father, Richard Killen, worked grueling hours in various aeronautical establishments but still made time to cook dinner every night, tell jokes and rant on politicians that came on TV. The brothers would have to commit to schoolwork and chores without supervision, which didn't always happen. These days Richard’s hard work has paid off and he is now a lead inspector at Lockheed Martin. On September 11th 2001 Matthew was taking his GED to formally drop out of high school. He wanted to join the military however they changed their requirements from a GED to a HSD and he was also arrested several times for not paying ticket fines. In a town that small you don’t get away with anything, especially being a Puerto Rican in Texas. Matthew has a history with the police in his small town, they knew him by name. One day his Dad was driving Matthew’s car alone when he was pulled over for a “spot check.” Richard was surprised to be pulled over and even more surprised were the police to find Richard and not Matthew in the car. Richard knew that Matthew was telling the truth all along about being harassed by the police. When Richard came home he told Matthew what happened and apoligised. Matthew’s only option to go to Job Corps and spend 3-6 months there to show the Navy he was serious about joining the military, so he took it. When he finished, it was the first time he wore a cap and gown, but it wouldn’t be the last as Matthew likes to say, “success is addictive.”  In the US Navy BM3 (SW) Killen saw the vast cultures of humanity. He was constantly having his good ol’ Texas paradigm challenged. Matthew immersed in the cultures of Europe and South America which built his own personal perspective on the world. As he walked the streets of Colombia on his last deployment, he never knew it would be his last. (Earlier in 2008 he fell down a ladder well which caused a back injury and severe insomnia but he got by.) The next night in the Cartagena Bay, the number four diesel generator seized causing a massive fire. A combination of the already provoking insomnia mixed with rotating watch cycles and days with no sleep was taking it’s toll. Matthew was on watch while they were waiting for orders and hallucinated he told his medical officer and was honorably medically discharged in April of that year. After getting out of the Navy Matthew felt some regret, regret that he didn’t do more to help change the Navy for the better. He complained about his back pain several times to no avail and just kept pushing his limits. On top of that they took away their “day sleeper cards” because one person lost one, there was no time to sleep. Matthew says the math wasn’t there for anyone to get decent sleep. There were three - five hour - watch sections so every fifteen hours you were on watch on top of your work day. He thought maybe if he would have went up the ladder, he could have made a change but it was too late, he was already out. Matthew knew that some people didn’t take him seriously because of his crooked teeth so he put himself through braces at Jacksonville University, he fell in love with the campus and hoped to one day attend but he knew with a GED that it was a long shot. After getting out of the Navy Matthew went to Florida State College at Jacksonville, a large junior college with campuses around Jacksonville, he met some good people, learned a lot and started to find his place in the civilian world. He graduated and his parents couldn’t be more proud as he was the first person in his entire family to go to college. He applied to several schools and was beside himself when Jacksonville University sent the letter of acceptance. While at Jacksonville University Matthew studied Public Relations and Film, worked on the Organizing for America Campaign for President Obama, was the campaign manager for Ramon Day for City Council, started three companies, and even went on tour with the band Slightly Stoopid as a videographer. Matthew set up charters and clubs for The Young Dems,The Tiger Bay Club and The University Law review writing constitutions for each one himself. Matthew was on the Dean’s List and graduated Jacksonville University, Zeta Phi Eta, balling his eyes out like a hungry baby with his entire family together by his side. In July of 2015, Matthew and a few of Jacksonville’s most talented game changers started the Jacksonville for Bernie Sanders Campaign, to fight for progressive ideas in their city. Through which they have gained thousands of progressive volunteers information and are working with now to elect a new government. Matthew is often heard in the news talking about turning Duval to Bluval! Matthew is currently working as a public relations consultant for new media at his company Killen Media LLC and the Communications Director for the Jacksonville Young Democrats. Matthew is running to be a PLEO Delegate for Bernie Sanders in May 2016. Will you help send him?"

Thus, we can't afford to go to the DNC without raising money. Hopefully, this situation will change when Bernie helps to eliminate student debt ;)  Until that day comes we need your help.  We need to pay for overpriced flights, $500 a night hotel rooms and an occassional ration of food (don't worry Janee doesn't eat much).  As you can imagine, prices went way up in Philadelphia due to DNC being there for a week.  If you can contribute any amount will help. Bernie would probably recommend $27 or $270 or really any variaton of the numbers 2 and 7.  Because many other delegates in Arizona will be raising money the same way, I am making a special shout out to all our friends across the country who always ask Janee and I ""when are you going to run for something?"" (you know who you are).  Well we ran for something, won and now we have to pay for it! Finally, we are going to the DNC to cast our votes for Bernie Sanders and to represent his platform. However, there may be a time that we have to focus on creating party unity to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.  I hope you all appreciate how important that is to our country.  Janee and I believe we are great voices of reason when it comes to this issue.  Additionally, we have an extremely important US Senate race and US Congressional races in Arizona and we intend to ensure the DNC is aware of that fact and that Donald Trump will put Arizona in play for the Democrats in the presidential election.  Thus, we will be doing a lot more than just attending the convention.*We must abide by the following rules for Janee and I to fundraise together as National Delegates for Bernie Sanders.

My wife and I have experienced the horrific effects of gun violence. In 2015 our daughter Alison was gunned down on live television while reporting for WDBJ7 in Roanoke, Virginia—her home, and a place she loved.  Since that time I have become a passionate and outspoken advocate for gun violence prevention. 

I was horrified to learn that The Berglund Center in Roanoke will be presenting NRA board member and has-been musician Ted Nugent on July 17, 2018 for a ""concert"".

Nugent is a disgusting human being. He smeared feces on himself and did hard drugs before a draft physical for Vietnam to avoid serving his country. He adopted a 17 year-old girl from Hawaii so he could have sex with her when he was 30. He's said, ""Apartheid isn't that cut and dried. All men are not created equal.""

Recently, Nugent said that the Parkland student-survivors who have advocated for stronger gun laws ""have no soul."" Then he went on Alex Jones' show and compared Democrats, reporters, academics, celebrities and ""half of government"" to ""rabid coyotes"" and told his fans ""every time you see one, you shoot one.""

By hosting this reprobate, the Berglund Center is telling victims and survivors of gun violence in Roanoke ""We don't care about you."" They're also putting a man on stage who is known to promote and provoke violence. It's a cruel and negligent decision by the Berglund Center.

I want to do everything I can to shame the Berglund Center, so I am launching a #BoycottBerglund campaign that will start with a three-sided, jumbo mobile billboard that will drive through downtown Roanoke during the  work day on July 2 and 3.

Below you will see the following photos: 1) An example of the jumbo billboard truck we are using, 2) Side 1 of our Nugent billboard, 3) Side 2 of our Nugent billboard. The rear panel on the truck will simply say #BoycottBerglund vertically.

This striking mobile billboard will appear in downtown Roanoke two weeks before Nugent's concert date. That will get the Roanoke community and media talking about the #BoycottBerglund campaign.  Dan Casey of The Roanoke Times has already done two stories in advance. More media will follow.

Will you help me offset the costs of this mobile billboard? The billboard costs just $2,000 for a total of 16 hours (8 hours each day). I also incurred $100 in costs for the design of the billboard.

Please help if you can by clicking the DONATE NOW button on this page and making a contribution! It doesn't matter if its $5 or $50. Every donation helps.

I want to send a message to the Roanoke community—to all of our communities—that Ted Nugent is not fit for polite company. NO ONE should be hosting this violent creep for any type of event, PERIOD.  After decades of his racism, misogyny, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and violent threats, we don't owe him a stage.  Especially in Alison's home.  

Thank you for being part of this effort! I believe Berglund Center is going to hear us loud and clear. WE CAN DO THIS. Let's show Berglund that Roanoke deserves better.

We are demanding justice for all Americans regardless of race or class; not just for the millionaires and billionaires.  In  the early sixties, Bernie was a civil rights activists and  member of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) and SNCC. Bernie was arrested for protesting  segregation. He walked across the bridge in Selma with Dr. Martin Luther King and attended the March on Washington to fight for justice, end systematic poverty, and fight for good jobs and fair wages for every American.  As progressives, we still have so much more work to do to achieve Economic Justice, Social Justice, Racial Justice, and Environmental Justice.  I will go to the convention this year to stand not only with Bernie, but with every progressive fighting for justice.Politcal and Social ActivismMy Journey with Bernie materialized in 2011 with the Occupy movement. Like millions of Americans, I became an active organizer and supporter of Occupy Wall Street. I traveled to New York to sleep out on Wall Street. For almost 2 months, I maintained an Occupy tent here in Dallas in protest of a system that I knew denied millions of Americans access to Economic, Social, Racial and Environmental Justice.  Since then, I have dedicated my life to helping change a system that perpetuates injustices upon ""the least among us.""OWS activists worked tirelessly to educate the public about breaking up the big banks, student loan debt, race and class discrimination, and getting money out of politics. The pursuit of Economic and Social Justice is a calling that I do not take lightly.  Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who has unequivocally brought our progressive message to millions of Americans. I do the work it takes to help spread the progressive message and increase Democratic voter participation. As a political activist, I have worked tirelessly to help organize voters in pre-primary, post-primary, and post-local conventions here in Texas, and in 10 other states. My national phone bank and field work has included KS, KY, WY, CO, CA, MN, TX, VA, NM, and FL.As a volunteer, I block-walked and phone-banked for Bernie pre-primary and pre-convention in Far North Dallas and Collin County. I organized a Bernie Sanders welcome table at the Collin County Convention.  Dallas Bernie Sanders Campaign staff also helped me organize a caucus effort in Colorado Springs, CO. Bernie won that caucus by almost 70%! It was a great early win for Bernie!After the Colorado primary, I did substantial planning and organizing in Wyoming, working with Wyoming University Students for Bernie Sanders. We had very successful voter outreach, registration, and organizing efforts which culminated with the Wyoming Sanders Rally. As you can tell, it's been a very busy year for this activist!Because of all of my primary work organizing for Bernie, I was humbled and honored by my appointment as the Official SD 8 Chair for the TX Bernie Sanders Campaign. As a political activist, I worked tirelessly to help create a progressive majority. Now I am asking for your help to get me to the DNC. Until Bernie came along, I never felt inspired enough to try for an ""Official"" Delegate Position; but I have always worked to spread a progressive message. I was previously involved in the Democratic Party process--as Co-chair and Field Organizer for Rockwall for Obama 2008. I also attended the DNC in 08' as a volunteer,  and was awarded with a credential pass for the final days of the convention. While in attendance, I caucused with the Progressive Democrats of America  (a group that helped get Bernie to run), organized with Move-On , and Code Pink Women for Peace . I continued to work with these groups long after the convention.￼￼Post Occupy, I worked with Sierra Club  activists in Dallas to get a ban placed on a fracking site near a DISD public school and as an education candidate to help stop privatization efforts of public schools. I helped support and organize many Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), Our Walmart, End Citizens United and  #FightFor15  demonstrations.  I also sat in the Senate Gallery with Wendy Davis and the Orange Army,  standing up for Planned Parenthood.I was a founding member of Dallas' Mothers Against Police Brutality (MAPB) and have  worked diligently to end systematic racial discrimination.  As a member of MAPB, I helped organize demonstrations and actions where thousands were in attendance. This year, I am working to bring Bernie's message home. I am continuing my efforts to help End Mass  Incarceration and Decriminalize Marijuana  possession. I am also currently helping three progressive candidates here in Collin County and two candidates in Dallas. Why am I asking for your support? I am a committed Democratic Activist and Political Organizer. My commitment has been unending; through thick and thin. I truly believe that this is not about me, but about us. I intend to continue our fight through the 2018 and 2020 election cycles. I can promise you that your investment in me as a national delegate will not be wasted. Our message is too important to let it go by the wayside. As a strong progressive, I intend to fight for our message for the rest of my life.I hope to make you proud by representing Democratic Progressives for Bernie Sanders at the National level! I would be extremely thankful for any and all contributions made to help me Stand for Economic, Racial, Social and Environmental Justice!￼￼Fannie Lou Hamer Link: http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/sayitplain/flhamer.htmlhttps://demconvention.com/news/ "

So, I have to get there because I might need to be there!The expenses are crazy - we're told to expect to spend $4000 per delegate - maybe more.

I hosted phonebank parties, made tons of calls for Bernie, was a call moderator and note taker for the state calls with the national team, volunteered at 2 different Phoenix rallies, canvassed, recruited over 500 more volunteers, organized a huge Debate Watch Party with over 100 people, went and spoke in Payson to the Democratic Women of Rim Country about Bernie, and organized a YUUUUUUGE fundraiser in Phoenix for Bernie with a healthcare theme called Feel The Bern for Healthcare.  All proceeds went to Bernie Sanders. I operate a facebook group called Healthcare Providers and Advocates for Bernie Sanders, and a facebook page called Feel The Bern for Healthcare. I'm involved in my local legislative district as a precinct committee person and helping our local candidates. As a social worker and a mental healthcare provider, I've been supporting progressive issues that honor human rights, equality, civil rights, quality education and social services since 1970 something.

$3,768 raised of $3,500                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/2at6exg,"Spokane, WA",Send Yvette Joseph to the DNC,"Created June 22, 2016","Dear Friends, I’m writing to seek your support, as a National Delegate for Hillary Clinton with plans to attend the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, PA. I’m very proud to represent the 5th Congressional District of Washington State as Hillary’s delegate, covering 11 Counties in Eastern Washington. Our district is centered on Spokane, the state’s second largest city.  When I worked in Washington, DC, for U.S. Senators Dan Evans (R – WA) and Dan Inouye (D- HI), with the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I was involved in President Bill Clinton’s Health Care Reform Task Force and met often with First Lady Hillary Clinton. For 12 weeks, I attended toll gate meetings at the White House to help shape the American Security Act. After that process ended, we invited Mrs. Clinton to meet with Tribal Leaders at the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. As you know, we were not successful in realizing health care reform, but under Hillary’s leadership, 48 states became part of the State Child Health Insurance Program in 1997. And because of these early discussions, Hillary helped President Clinton to encourage the establishment of the President’s Executive Order on Government-to-Government Consultation with Tribal Governments.  Today, my primary work is to help expand oral health care in every community, by promoting the use of dental therapists. A dental therapist is a provider who works as part of a dental care team, similar to how a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant works as part of the medical team. Midlevel dental care is common in more than 50 countries around the world, including Canada. In 2003, the Tribes in Alaska started a program to bring services to patients in places where dentists don’t normally work, including schools, nursing homes, mobile clinics and other settings. Now dental therapists serve 81 communities in Alaska and are authorized in Minnesota, Maine and Vermont, and are working in the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and with two Tribes in Oregon.  We are working to promote this policy change because 130 million Americans lack access to needed dental care. And in Washington State, 35 of 39 Counties do not have enough dentists to meet the needs of our citizens.It is my goal to mobilize Washington State Democrats to help expand dental care to every citizen, especially working families who cannot afford to access care.  I’m honored to serve as an elected Precinct Committee Officer in Spokane County and will do all that I can to share updates and work to get out the vote in the upcoming campaign. I am working to ensure Democrats win the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House and in our State Legislature. Attending the Democratic Convention will help me to realize this goal.We worked at the WA State Convention to successfully include language to support dental therapy in the Tribal Nations plank. Some of that language made it into the latest draft of the national platform because of the great advocacy work of Tulalip Tribal Member and Bernie Sander’s Delegate Deborah Parker. This week, I’ve been spending many long nights helping to prepare a provision to expand oral health care to every American under the Health plank. This is important because there is no mention of dental or oral health care in the platform. Ms. Parker is hopeful that she will succeed in getting the language adopted.  I hope you can see that I am devoted to advancing health policy to serve working families, will seek to address racial justice and support the creation of good-paying jobs by promoting clean energy to overcome climate change.  If you have a burning issue you believe needs attention, please let me know at my Facebook Account. As a single mother with a 2016 graduate of Washington State University and another student who attends Whitworth University, I need help, mostly to pay for the hotel room in Philadelphia, PA, along with taxi, meals and other costs.  It is important to secure these funds before July 22, 2016. I believe that in order to give, is to receive.  So I plan to gift a beautiful Hillary for America beaded medallion and a pair of beaded earrings to two people who contribute to my go fund me account. These individuals will be selected before the Convention on July 25 to 28, 2016.  So please consider donating $5, $10, $25, $50 or $100 to my go fund me account.  Your support will be used wisely and with great appreciation, as I hope to continue to serve others. Thank you for considering this request.  Lem Lempt – Thank you!! Yvette Joseph"

The above video is the first episode of a serial documentary about my family and I, produced by Talking Eyes Media and a project of Newest Americans . I have a deep-rooted, long term commitment to social justice & civil rights and I joined the Rutgers School of Law to become a more effective advocate.I graduated from Rutgers University, summa cum laude, in 2011 with a B.A. in Sociology & a minor in Women’s & Gender Studies. I co-founded the New Jersey Dream Act Coalition prior to law school and currently serve as co-chair of the Immigrant Rights Collective and as a Marsha Wenk Public Interest Law Fellow at the law school. I am Treasurer of the Evening Students Association and a proud member of the Minority Student Program . My advocacy, public service, and leadership has been recognized by several organizations, including my two alma maters,  Middlesex County College , Rutgers University , and even the New Jersey General Assembly . I am dedicated to social justice lawyering and I want to use my legal career to serve and advocate on behalf of the under-represented and disadvantaged. In the summer of 2015, I had an extraordinary opportunity at social justice lawyering.  I served as summer counsel at the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau , the nation's oldest student-run non-profit that provides free civil legal services to low-income Boston residents. Two organizations, RU Law's Public Interest Law Foundation and the Equal Justice America, awarded me with fellowships that enabled me to relocate to Cambridge/Boston for three months. There, I managed about ten housing and wage/hour cases and I worked at a restaurant part-time.  I was so lucky to work alongside City Life/Vida Urbana (CLVU), an outstanding grassroots organization fighting gentrification in Boston and mobilizing communities against displacement. My clients there, and the staff at CLVU, reinvigorated my commitment to my study of law. The second installment of Newest Americans captures a bit of that summer, and you can watch it here . I am raising money to help me pay for the cost of law school, bar prep and study, and the NJ and NY bar exams. I sent several administrators an email in the Fall 2015 semester to explain why I need assistance, so now I invite you to read it as well: ""I am undocumented. My parents and I entered the United States in 1988 when I was a year old. We have only lived in New Jersey since our arrival almost thirty years ago. I have been open about my status since childhood and I have been public about my story for about ten years.  A Rutgers- Newark project, Newest Americans, is the most recent platform to share my experience via a multi-part, serial documentary.There are approximately 2 million undocumented young adults like myself who entered the United States as children.   Various research organizations estimate that only about 5-10% of undocumented high school graduates go on to college.  Far fewer proceed towards a graduate program.  In fact, based on a national list-serve created exclusively for undocumented law school students, there are fewer than 30 of us (known) nationwide. We are in California, Florida, New York, New Mexico, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Texas, District of Columbia, Michigan, and Illinois. Only three jurisdictions- California, Florida, and New York- have addressed whether undocumented law school graduates can practice law. All three of those states now admit undocumented law graduates to practice under varying criteria.I am the first undocumented law school student in the State of New Jersey, and the only one so far*[There's another undocumented law student in NJ, but I will not 'out' that individual without his/her consent. I am still poised to be the first undocumented law school graduate in 2017.]  But for the following financial constraints, I would not have such a difficult time paying for school:I pay for law school out-of-pocket because I am ineligible for all forms of publicly financed and/or subsidized financial aid, including federal and state loans and grants. I am ineligible because those prominent and popular means of financing higher education are available only to U.S. Citizens and Legal Permanent Residents. I am neither a U.S. Citizen (USC) nor a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR); rather, I am undocumented/unauthorized. I still have no legal status under immigration law despite possessing valid work authorization through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.Private loans through financial institutions like Wells Fargo and Bank of America also require applicants to be USCs or LPRs. Even if those institutions allowed me to apply, it would be very unlikely for the banks to offer me a loan because I do not have the requisite credit or assets to qualify. Undocumented/unauthorized immigrants who never (or until very recently) had a Social Security Number, like me, cannot establish the qualifying credit so quickly. I could list a co-signer who is a USC or LPR on an application, but I do not have family members who are either willing or eligible. Both my parents are also undocumented/unauthorized and cannot apply. My only adult sibling lacks good credit and she has four children of her own to sustain.  Therefore, I can only pay for school out-of-pocket and I can only enroll for the amount of credits I can afford.  The amount of credits I can afford is offset by my living expenses: whereas many of my peers “live at home” and are spared living expenses, I live alone. Even if I lived with a family member, my family is working-poor and cannot afford to help me. I have been financially independent since the age of seventeen, and I have assisted and continue to assist them however I can.Currently, I bartend and manage at a brewpub in New Brunswick and there are several factors contributing to my reduced income- over 90% of my income comes from tips. As a result, I dropped my health insurance coverage to afford the costs of transportation. I’ve applied to scholarships, and Nicky Fornarotto of Financial Aid has been the most helpful person on campus, but I continue to struggle every semester.As an undergraduate, my exceptional GPA, a 3.9, justified the University’s decision to pay the last two years of my program. Unfortunately, my law school GPA is deplorable. I attribute my sub-par performance- and the consequent loss of my partial academic scholarship- to the year-long depression that afflicted me in my first year. I paid out-of-pocket to seek professional help and I have since recovered.  My GPA does not reflect my intellect and neither does it predict my potential as an attorney: Internship supervisors, practicing attorneys, faculty and staff can attest to my abilities and skills.I need help financing this semester and the rest of my time at Rutgers Law School. Every other undocumented law school student receives aid. A few schools provided full tuition scholarships to their respective undocumented law school student. Another student took out an institutional loan from his/her private law school.  I do not know how Rutgers University can help me now.I defer to you and the administration's decisions. I would gladly meet to brainstorm solutions. ""In my two years between my undergrad and law school, I started a scholarship in honor of my parents at Rutgers University to financially assist immigrant students. While I can no longer maintain that commitment now- as I am the one in need- I fully intend on paying it forward and resuming my donations to assist other similarly-situated students once I graduate.All money raised will go directly to pay for tuition, a bar prep course, and the bar exam itself. Your help will enable me to save money so I can take some time off work to exclusively study for the bar exam in 2017. Thank you for learning about me. Thank you for sharing. And especially thank you for donating. No donation is too small. <3Additionally, you're welcome to peruse some of the following media/press coverage of me and my work:Feature in Rutgers SAS Alumni Newsletter  March 2013Video: Featured on Due Process' ""DREAM Act- One Step Closer"" August 2012NJ Star Ledger Article about DACA  August 2012Video: Featured on Due Process' ""DREAM Act: Dead or Deferred?""

I was very proud to stand with former Wyoming Secretary of State, Kathy Karpan, to nominate Secretary Clinton to be our next President of the United States of America! Leading up to the caucuses on April 9th, I was thrilled to meet President Clinton and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Both of them spoke about how diversifying Wyoming's economy into cleaner technologies like Wind and Solar could help Wyoming become a leader in the new energy economy. Hillary Clinton supports building our infrastructure to export this clean energy that Wyoming so desperately needs. The only way to prevent the boom and bust cycle that hurts Wyoming's families is to work together to diversify our economy and take advantage of the renewable resources that Wyoming has so much of.Wyoming IS the Equality State and it's time for true Equality for all Wyomingites including LGBT, women, immigrants and so many others. My husband, Jeran Artery, and I have had the privilege of leading Wyoming Equality, our state's largest LGBT organization. We were instrumental in bringing marriage equality to Wyoming and we continue to fight for non-discrimination and transgender rights on the local and state levels. Additionally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my unequivocal support for equal pay for equal work. The gender pay cap must be closed and I can think of no better way to do that then to elect our first Female President! I'm not voting for Hillary because she's a woman (although that's awesome!); I'm voting for her because she's the most qualified person to take the helm on day one. I'm proud to work for the Wyoming Retirement System and take care of our public employee's pensions. I'm a member of the Wyoming Public Employee's Association, I'm the Treasurer of the Laramie County Democrats, and I believe in fighting for public employees. Unions have been the foundation of the Wyoming Democratic Party and we must fight to keep them strong and relevant. Lastly, I had the distinct privilege of volunteering and working with the Cheyenne for Hillary campaign. I created the Cheyenne for Hillary Facebook page. I had the opportunity to work with the young, dedicated individuals who came to Cheyenne to fight for Hillary in Laramie County and help her win our State's Capitol and most populous county. Meeting President Bill Clinton and Secretary Ken Salazar was absolutely amazing. But the most important moment was when my amazing friends, Jeran Artery, Wendy Soto, Kate Wright and I made dinner and brought it to Kathy Karpan's Law Office to support the tireless efforts of these volunteers. I have never had more joy in my heart:Nick, my main contact with the Hillary campaign, tweeted:First Inaugural @HillaryforWY Supper Club!

I'm Justin Murphy, a newspaper reporter for the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, New York. I've been lucky to live in the Finger Lakes region  of upstate New York for most of my life; this summer, I'll get to know those lakes a little better.From May to August, I'll be riding my bicycle around each of the 11 Finger Lakes, a total of 435 miles. I first had the idea after riding the length of the Erie Canal,  from Buffalo to Albany, in 2013. I wanted another cycling adventure, and the Finger Lakes - long, skinny and hilly, all within 90 minutes of my house in Rochester - fit the bill perfectly.While I originally conceived of it as a fun project for the summer, I also hope to raise some money for a good cause. As the K-12 education reporter  in one of the poorest urban school districts in the country,  I see the effects of grinding generational poverty nearly every day at work. I also get an up-close look at some of the people and agencies working tirelessly to help children onto the path toward a brighter future.One of the most impressive is the Nurse-Family Partnership, a national program operating in Rochester and hundreds of other communities across the country.  The concept is simple: first-time mothers living in poverty are connected with a nurse early in pregnancy. The mother - on average, 19 years old, unmarried and living on less than $10,000 a year - learns some of the parenting skills that she herself might not have benefited from. The nurse visits continue through birth and until the child turns 2 years old. The outcomes  are pretty remarkable: one follow-up study showed declines of 48 percent in child abuse and neglect, 67 percent in behavioral and intellectual difficulties at age 6 and 72 percent in mothers being arrested. Another study showed a benefit to society of $5.70 for every dollar invested in the program.Rochester is a wealthy community with incredible resources. For infants in our city to be condemned to a life of poverty because their mothers lack for basic information and services is wrong. This is a program that helps.As I go, I'll be posting progress updates, photos and video to my blog. I'll also be joined on the rides by some of my friends - more about that later. In the meantime, I hope you'll consider donating some of your hard-earned money toward a truly worthy cause."

Because abuse of Native Americans is not a thing of history. It is current, alive, and it is ours to deal with. If we do not act, we are compliant with those abuses.  And because our water is our life. We must start paying attention to how we care for our water resources, and our planet.We can't stand by and watch yet another treaty be ignored, and yet another watershed get set up to be contaminated by a multinational who will only get a slap on the wrist as they destroy our nation's natural resources for profit. This is a matter of integrity for all of us. Let's take pride in right action. This is a matter of national security. Let's treat it as one. This impacts all of us, and sooner or later, if left unchecked, this sort of abuse will show up in your community too. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I am only asking for $500 because I am leaving *this Friday morning* September 9th (in two more days!) to be there in time for the announcement of the Federal Court's decision on whether the pipeline will continue or be put on hold for review. It's short notice, I know, so I am looking for meaningful supplies that will help spread the word and tell their story: high-powered, portable solar chargers and supplies that can be used to keep TV cameras and other recording and broadcasting devices working. I'd also like to bring up the usual supplies that thousands of people might need: reusable water bottles and dinnerware, food, and first aid supplies. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A little about me: I am a Berniecrat activist and New Deal Democrat (the real ones who fought for Progressive values in the 'old days'!). I met Chief Arvol Looking Horse, keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe and chief of the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Nations as a college student at the Conference on World Affairs in Boulder, Colorado, where I served as his local host in 1997. He invited me to a Gathering at Pipestone, Minnesota to meet up with the Thunder Riders as they rode to mend the Sacred Hoop. That experience changed my life. I hope that this trip to Standing Rock at least begins to repay the kindness I experienced from the elders at that event. It is the least I can do. May I have many more opportunities to stand for what is right, and may we all lend our voices and our actions to healing our communities and our planet. Thank you for your good heart, for caring, and doing what you can do. We- individually and collectively -are more powerful than the people currently in power want us to know.

My name is David Morgan and I am proud to have been selected to be the Labour candidate for the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency in Walsall in the upcoming General Election on Thursday 12th December 2019.

I live in the centre of Brownhills and I am very aware of the issues that our towns and communities face. Aldridge-Brownhills feels like a forgotten part of our borough, with its fate being decided by only 66% of its voters. After 40 years of Conservative representation in Aldridge-Brownhills, now more than ever, real change is needed.Having worked in schools for over 15 years, I have seen first-hand the damage that has been done by almost 10 years of Conservative and Liberal Democrat imposed austerity. Everyday I see the cold, hard reality of how Conservative government policies and choices are affecting our children, friends, families and communities. I have seen and heard real life accounts of how Universal Credit is devastating lives, plunging families into poverty and debt, causing ill health and forcing people to have to rely upon food banks.Aldridge-Brownhills is now home to three food banks: one in Pelsall, one in Brownhills, and one in Aldridge. This simply should not be happening in 2019 and in the fifth largest economy in the world.Our high streets and towns are littered with empty shops and buildings, poor infrastructure and outdated transport links. Many promises have been made by the Mayor of the West Midlands and Government alike, but in reality these are just empty words with no action. We the people are left to pick up the pieces of this broken infrastructure.As an ordinary resident living in Brownhills, I want to stand up for our constituency and argue for and help to deliver change. We need real actions, not empty promises. Our great towns and villages from Brownhills to Streetly, Aldridge to Pelsall, Walsall Wood to Rushall, Shelfield to Clayhanger, Lazy Hill to Shire Oak and Catshill to Ogley Hay deserve better.This general election is a chance to vote for real change. Vote for a local voice to make Aldridge-Brownhills heard at the heart of Westminster. To achieve this I need to be able to connect with voters, through leaflets, calling cards and social media. All of this comes at a cost, and as a non-target seat we have to raise our own money to campaign and take the fight for real change to the Conservatives. 

Please help us to take the fight for change to the Conservatives and make a huge impact in Aldridge-Brownhills.

It seemed clear to me that Bernie was the man for the job and we needed him now more than ever.

First meeting we had in my living room, 45 people showed up, including a State Senator and a Representative. We planned flyering, canvass events and future meetings at the more spacious bar around the corner. Along the way, I met other ambitious organizers like Keith Mundy, Steve Holecko and Michael Berler. Together we orchestrated opening 6 volunteer offices across the state, the first here in Lakewood. Our first mission was getting Bernie on the ballot. Then organized for our delegate caucuses where many of the grassroots crew won delegate spots at the Democratic National Convention.

In 2008, I realized that I had a passion for Democratic politics. I wanted to learn to use the gifts and talents and the education I had to become the most effective campaigner and advocate I could be; I wanted to put my hands on the wheel of government and steer it towards policies that would help families and neighborhoods like mine. Impoverished but hopeful. Diverse but united. Just like the biracial president-elect, who inspired biracial me.8 years after Barack Obama inspired me I have gone from summer intern for Bill White for Governor, to organizing for two different State Reps, to field director for an El Paso city councilman, to being the only staff for a newly elected appellate judge in a race that spanned 17 West Texas counties. After staffing now on five consecutive winning campaigns (and learning a little bit of Spanish), the Hillary Clinton campaign has offered me a chance to be a Regional Organizing Director in Michigan.The Great Lakes State is at risk of swinging to Trump. In an election with some of the highest stakes in US history, I want to work hard to keep ""Trumpence"" from gaining traction.  I've always wanted to work on a presidential campaign and this may be the only opportunity I ever have to do so. Organizing this area could even provide lessons on how to elect more Democrats here in Texas in 2018, 2020 and beyond. But there is one thing keeping me from this dream duty...I need to get a car before August 1st.From the age of seven, I grew up with a single father below the poverty line. Throughout my school years, while many peers were getting their licenses and first cars, my Dad and I relied on public transit. My father now only has a car because, as a cab driver, it's his livelihood.  I got used to that way of life and never really had the time or resource to learn to drive and get a car. Lack of a personal vehicle has been the number one limiting factor in pursuing my goals, and it is a requirement for any position with the Clinton campaign. My joining the team in MI is conditional on my ability to get a reliable car to traverse the mountainous terrain within the next two weeks. To paraphrase a quote from a favorite movie, ""This is my most desperate hour. Help me, you are my only hope.""My ego isn't big enough to think I'm entitled to this, or that Hillary won't be elected without me, and my nature isn't to ask for anything I'm not able to repay in short order. I'm doing this only because several friends and family, who have long believed in and supported me, have encouraged me to do so.But this car could change my life. This job could change my life. Both are bound. I humbly ask for whatever generous contributions you can make. If you can't donate I ask you to share this with your network, or lend me some advice. I'm asking you all to enable me to pour my soul into long hours of difficult work in an unfamiliar place.The drive to Detroit from Dallas, TX is 17 hours nonstop. Whatever monies aren't used to cover expenses for the trip and, of course, a fuel efficient car or truck, will be donated to United Way, a favorite charity of my late mother.Please, check out my LinkedIn to see more about my experience and feel free to contact me with questions and/or wisdom.

I truly believe this could be a pivotal moment in our nation's history, because Bernie Sanders has given so many of us a voice to stand up and demand change in our system. By going to the national convention, I will be able to directly have a part in invoking the change we need for our future generations. As I said during my speech, I will do whatever it takes to make our voices heard and make the change we're fighting for now, a reality for our future.I have heard it will take about $5,000 to pay for the trip.

I am currently a videographer and part time real estate agent. I have literaly fallen into this position because there is a great need for people with passion, charisma, energy and new ideas. I never intended to enter politics, but I am doing it because it is clearly the right thing to do with the current political climate we are facing today.Despite being prepared mentally and educationally to succeed in this task for my fellow residents of District 26, the financial burden is immense for most people to handle alone. The Democratic Party has arranged hotel rooms at Philadelphia's Downtown Marriott. Below is an except from the Democratic Party about the hotel rooms.""The convention will be at the Philadelphia downtown Marriott. With taxes, fees, etc it is estimated that a king room will cost around $600/night. Delegates are expected to arrive Sunday and need to plan to be there 5 nights. You are definitely able & encouraged to fundraise to help cover the costs of the trip""Aside from that, they are many other costs associated with travel, food and proper attire (I will need to trade in my flip flops)I am grateful in advanced for all of your kind words and support and am very honored to have this opportunity to represent the community and show the big wigs up north a thing or two about ""One Human Family"""

I am looking for 1 million like minded people who have had enough.  If 1 million people donated 10 per month it would raise 120 million a year enough to legitimately fund legislative campaigns with our initial goal of electing one honest and decent individual to congress within the next two years.  The mandate of the party would not be affiliated as a liberal or a conservative but as an American.  With the initial start up we will build a social media platform free from advertising where each member of the party can express their views and the entire party can instantaneously vote on issues like illegal immigration, tax reform, tort reform, healthcare and all issues that effect our health and well being as individuals and as citizens.      So how do we accomplish this by limiting donations to 10 dollars initially and to 10 dollars per month after the American Party has been established.  That way no one person has any greater influence over the party.  The American Party will develop an app that is a crossover of social media and financial services to ensure the party member’s identity.  As the party progresses we will be able to lobby and elect representatives and congressmen that are not beholden to any corporations, religions or political ideologies.  Our goal will be to find and support decent and honest human beings.  Most of you that read this the first time will probably think I am crazy and rightfully so.  Anyone who tries to battle the corporate political party structure generally gets eaten alive.  It starts as the first person who puts on the yellow vest or creates a movement by refusing to move to the back of the bus.  Most will probably laugh at the idiot that posted this but just think if it started with a million people what 50 million could do and so forth.  What could a party of 50 million with 500 million a month accomplish maybe elect a president and few hundred legislators.  The last question you will ask or maybe the first will be who is this idiot that wants to change the world for 10 dollars a month.  A disgruntled political science major who has only voted once in the last 20 years.  When in college a newly tenured professor full of lust and zeal asked the class “give me the definition of political science” and I blurted out BULLSHIT!  Needless to say I received my first and only F but I can’t say I would go back and change my answer.  Let’s end the bullshit. Most  of us who work for a living have no real influence.  We either have to choose a democrat or republican or waste a vote on a libertarian.  All sounds great but what are the principals of The American Party?  That’s hard to answer it’s up to us as an organization to develop as we grow.  I can tell you what I believe in is having the right to say Santa Claus and Christmas, though I am not religious prayers before sporting events, and generally most of the ideals of our founding fathers who warned of big governments and corporations.  But I am only one vote.   The Party will be established with the social media platform so that members can instantaneously vote on core issues.  No more main stream corporate media polls ,propaganda, and data mining.  If 50 million members vote towards open borders or border walls at least the real Americans will finally have a voice! And can be truly counted.  I appreciate if you actually read my midnight ravings and if you did it means I was either dumb enough to post this or brave enough.  Either way I refuse to get up and move to the back of the bus and I will have a voice going forward.  And for those of you that didn’t make it to the end well that’s ok I’ve been with you for the last 26 years, silent and watching ROME burn.Ps  It’s less than a movie and I am the first to donate.  Your donation is important but it’s spreading the idea that makes it work."

Our family is pooling resources to raise funds to cover the cost of the funeral and obituary in the Press Democrat, but we are reaching out to our network of friends and family, and to anyone else who knew Jim, to contribute. For those of you who didn’t know Jim personally, we hope that his life story inspires you!Here’s Jim’s story:James Thomas “Jim” Wilson Jr. was born on March 1, 1956 at Selfridge Air Force Base in Michigan. When he was born, it was discovered that he had spina bifida, a birth defect related to the spinal cord that causes paralysis and swelling of the brain. Back in 1956, treatment options were so limited that doctors often advised parents not to take their babies home.Jim’s parents, Frances Wilson and late James Wilson Sr, did not accept the troubling medical prognosis. Instead, they fought for their first-born child to grow up and have a normal life. In his infancy and early childhood, his parents cleverly figured out ways to help overcome each of Jim’s challenges as a baby. They came up with things like protective devices for the sensitive areas around his spine, and even built wheeled carts for baby Jim to have help while learning how to crawl.Jim went on to become a big brother, having both a sister and a kid brother. They all looked after each other and formed a close bond. Attending public school in the 1960s before wheelchair accessibility and specialized education were common, Jim graduated from Casa Grande High School in 1975, and even went on to take college courses at the College of Marin. Jim and his family enjoyed travels to New York, Arizona, Japan, Mexico, and Hawaii. As an adult, Jim was a dedicated volunteer at Petaluma Chamber of Commerce for more than 25 years, and also volunteered at the Petaluma Library. He was known for being fiercely independent around town, often seen cruising in his electric wheelchair to the local Starbucks and other local businesses. Knowing how important mobility is to people, Jim worked with his mother and the city to make many ofPetaluma’s sidewalks more wheelchair accessible.In his senior years, Jim attended art classes at the Petaluma Senior Center, where he created many beautiful ceramics and paintings. Throughout his life, Jim had an optimistic attitude that inspiredeveryone around him. On March 31, 2018, Jim passed away peacefully at home, due to recurring breathing complications. He is survived by his mother Frances, sister Lori, brother Greg, sister-in- law Tammy, uncles, aunts, and many nieces and nephews. He also leaves behind his greatly loved dog, Foxy. Our family and community already miss Jim terribly, but are grateful for his incredible contributions to our hometown. All donations will go to obituary and funeral costs. Any remaining donations beyond our fundraising goal will go towards the Hospice of Petaluma, to support an organization that supported Jim and his family through a time of need.Friends and family are welcome to attend a memorial service Monday April 23 at 11am at Parent-Sorensen Mortuary and Crematory in Petaluma.“Those we love don’t go away,They walk beside us every day,Unseen, unheard, but always near,Still loved, still missed and very dear.”"

I contacted my reservation, Big Grassy River First Nation, and they helped as much as they could. In spring of 2018, I participated in the Native American Political Leadership Program at George Washington University where we studied politics and interned in agencies and offices in DC.

I’ve been apart of AU Democrats and Proud Indigenous People’s for Education, while I worked as a building manager.I can sit here and tell every mistake I made to get myself into this situation, but I would rather fix the problem. I have a $8,000 bill that is keeping me from registering for classes next semester. I’ve exhausted all help I have access to and it’s taken all the courage I have to admit I need major help. I only have 3 semesters left until I have my bachelors. I’m currently on a leave of absence to work and save money for future semesters. I’ve secured more help from my school and outside scholarships for Fall 2019, but only if I pay off this remaining $8,000.

Out of the five, there were three women from Thurston County. Tamborine Borrelli was one of those 3 women!Tamborine is asking for YOUR help to raise money to defray the cost of flights, hotel rooms and other travel expenses to get from Thurston County to Philadelphia by the week of July 24, 2016. Meet Tamborine:Tamborine was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. Her parents were small business owners of a beauty salon and her father worked a second job as an educator teaching psychology and civics to high school students.Tamborine was inspired to get involved in politics as the movement around Bernie Sanders came into being. She opened up a volunteer campaign office to organize the people of the 2nd LD to register to vote, pre-register for the caucus, as well as facilitating phone banking and doorbelling for the campaign. She became a deputy field organizer for the campaign, a caucus site leader and was on the Thurston Democrat Platform committee.Tamborine’s passion for justice and ensuring that everyone has a chance to live their best life has been a driving force in her life for years. From running after-school programs for underprivileged girls in the Chicago projects, to working as a personal coach in Los Angeles, to opening a community cafe featuring organic, local food as well as local theater acts, using her skills to serve others just comes naturally.She also isn’t afraid to stand up for what is right. Tamborine was one of roughly 1,400 activists arrested on the steps of the Capitol as part of the Democracy Spring movement urging Congress to pass legislation to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizen’s United ruling. As Tamborine was getting handcuffed alongside activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens from across the country, she looked up into the windows of Congress and wondered how America could work better if just a few more of those offices were held by people with the kind of forethought, integrity, and passion as the citizens she was now sharing a police van with. Bernie's vision is what has inspired Tamborine to become involved as a National Delegate and was at the root of her decideding to run for State Senator in WA state. As challenging as running a campaign can be it makes it all the more powerful for her to be there in Philly as one of Bernie's advocates.Being a National Delegate was something Tamborine knew she had to accomplish so she could be there in Philly ready, willing and able to STAND WITH and FOR Bernie, the one man who has fought for the people and has refused to give up. Tamborine feels she was born for this REVOLUTION and will be the kind of delgate that Bernie can DEPEND on to fight and not give in to the pressures of the establishment.Please consider contributing to this fund to help with the expenses that come with traveling to Philladelphia, PA as a National Delegate. Tamborine will be forever grateful to be able to give all that she is to this process without having to stress about financial concerns in making it happen. Thank you in advance for your consideration and In Solidarity.

We come from all walks of life in Nebraska: Democrats, Republicans, and independents; teachers, lawyers, scientists, professors, information technologists, retirees, students, faith leaders, stay-at-home parents. We are Nebraskans concerned about gun violence in our state and country. We think we can do better, and we advocate for ways to reduce gun violence. We do not oppose gun ownership–in fact, many of us own guns. However, we think Nebraska and the U.S. can do a better job of ensuring that guns stay out of the hands of irresponsible people, and that we can implement sensible ways to mitigate gun violence through universal background checks, safe storage, rigorous training requirements for carrying guns in public, and keeping guns out of certain areas of our lives.
Our ask:
Nebraskans Against Gun Violence has already been fighting for sensible gun laws in our state. Our volunteers testified against seven dangerous gun lobby bills at our legislature this year and are busy building an interfaith coalition. Now we are excited to formalize our organization so we can do even more to protect Nebraska citizens. We don't charge membership fees. We are asking for donations to pay for the non-profit incorporation fees for our 501c3 Coalition of Nebraskans Against Gun Violence and 501c4 Nebraskans Against Gun Violence. Any money we raise over the $888 we need and modest GoFundMe fees will go toward normal operating expenses of the organization.  Thank you! Together we can make Nebraska an even better place."

Republicans need to fix their dysfunctional party and Democrats need to fix ours.  I do not want the Democratic Party to fail.

There is no such thing as free speech at Orwellian Facebook. This is anti-conservative hatred in a most wicked and unAmerican form. If this egregious discrimination is allowed, then we have no First Amendment. President Trump and Congress are aware of Fascistbook's bias against conservative publishers and I believe will address it in a meaningful way at some point over the next two years or possibly into the next administration. Until then, we desperately need help. We are trying to raise $150,000 for legal expenses to sue Facebook and to keep the lights on at Powdered Wig and the message alive over the next two years. Anything we can raise in addition to that will go toward future operations beyond 2020 or until Washington finally tames the belligerent social media giants which are openly violating the First Amendment rights of conservative publishers. Please help if you can. Anything will help. No amount is too small. If you can't help with a donation, then please share our GoFundMe link (https://www.gofundme.com/powdered-wig-society) on your social media pages.

These crises have brought misery for many people in our community. The housing crisis is one that affects so many in our town. Rents are rising and people are being priced out of the market. Landlords are refusing Housing Assistant Payments (HAP) and rental allowances, while picking and choosing who they rent to and for how long. Families are left without basic shelter and security because both local and national governments have failed to plan for and deliver the required housing. This is unacceptable and it is a stain on our society. The myriad excuses for inaction and delays are unacceptable.

It is true that there are local plans for new developments and new houses. These are very welcome but it is taking far too long for plans to become reality.

 He might not even get a chance to participate!""  Well, I was also ""only an alternate"" to the NDP state convention, but because I showed up for all three days, I was seated as a delegate to help shape the state party platform and, hopefully, its future.  There's always a chance that any of the 15 Sanders delegates to National could fall ill or be otherwise forced to miss it, so as the only backup, I aim to once again be there, ready to roll up my sleeves and jump in.I'm asking for your support because, well, I'm not the 1%.  It's going to be expensive!  The hotel bloc that the Nebraska delegation will share with the Nevada and Colorado delegations is estimated to cost between $500 and $600 each night, for five nights, which doesn't even include the cost of travel (or possibly even food).  I've set the goal at $3000 to reflect those realities.If this funding campaign goes over the goal, or if it gets close enough to the goal that there are any funds left over after the trip, I will donate any remaining balance to the Lincoln chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby.Thanks for your time and your support!

I am taking off time from work and making this trip to support the political revolution that Bernie has inspried in America.Here is my statement about why I sought to be delegate:My involvement in politics and public service was inspired by Bernie when I arrived at UVM in 1981. He threw open the doors of City Hall in such a meaningful way that I became actively engaged in this community and built a sense of belonging and purpose that has only grown with time. I served as the organizer of Students for Sanders during my UVM time.Over 85% of voters in the Vermont Democratic primary chose Bernie and I want to ensure that his cause has strong allies capable of remaining true to his core principles yet capable of building the important bridges needed to ensure a general election victory.In addition to working on virtually every one of Bernie's elections since he became Mayor, I have also worked on the elections of many Democrats over the last three decades. To quote Hilary, ""there is more that unites us than divides us."" I want to be part of making sure that the party is united advancing a progressive agenda that blends the best of the respective platforms of both Bernie and Hillary.

Dear Family, Friends,  and other Compassionate people...It humbles and saddens me to ask others for help, but I find myself in a situation where I am in dire need of financial assistance.  I understand that some may not have the means to donate and others may need to make small donations.  Whatever you can do to assist me will be most appreciated....even if it's just to share this request on Facebook.I am so blessed to have an awesome family and dear friends in my life.  Thanks to my talented daughter, Heather Haze, her partner, Bobbie and her musical associates, I have great music enhancing my life. Music and dance are gifts the Universe bestows on us, if we're lucky enough.Yes, I am truly blessed, but yet I find myself in a very perilous situation.1. UPCOMING HOUSING CRISIS:  In 1987, after my divorce, I fled Iowa from an abusive husband, to resettle in the DC area. I virtually started my life over at 40.  After some help from a dear friend and his family, I found a one-bedroom condo to rent in Fairfax.  It's been my home for over 30 years.  My landlady, who is now elderly, has informed me recently that she needs to sell it soon to move in with her daughter and she wanted to give me a heads up. Time flies.... I have always dreamed of owning a home, but it's been an elusive dream for me.  Life often gets in the way of our dreams.  Now I find myself, as a Senior citizen on a severely limited income, which is going to make finding a decent place a real obstacle.  Rents are high in Fairfax with most one bedrooms starting at $1400-1700 per month and 2 bedrooms $1700 plus.FURRY FAMILYAlso, I have 3 furry friends (a 7-year-old dog and 2 cats - One is 10 and the other 16 years old.) They are my babies and my forever friends, so they must be part of the plan.  I am truly concerned about them even beyond my own concerns of relocating.  I will NOT let them down in anyway.It's my hope to get funding to cover moving costs, security deposits, pet fees and at least three months rent to give me time to get settled.  In the meantime, I'm working through 30 years of accumulated stuff.  You know the saying, “When one door closes, another opens” (that is if you don’t have too much junk in front of the door…)  It’s time to reorganize and keep only those things dear to me and are practical and useful in my life.  Not an easy task - emotionally or physically.Ideally, it would be so wonderful, not to worry about my income for a couple of months.  I spend so much time trying to supplement my Social Security, it leaves me with little time or energy to get everything else done.2. ONLINE ACTIVISM: When I lost my 5 year job on an Army contract, due to a workforce reduction in 2009.  I needed to regroup and didn't like what I saw was happening within the Tea Party..  Having served as an Online Communications Consultant for such national services as: America Online, The Source, AT&T's Interchange and CompuServe, I felt I could make a difference in America by using these skills on Facebook. I've used my own resources to fund the many hours a day that I've devoted to changing messaging where the need arises.  I would like to see this thru the Mid-Terms and possibly thru the next presidential election.  Any funding that goes above my housing goals will go towards my activism. I'm passionate in my belief, that thru online activism, we plant seeds that can grow and spread - much like the ""Johnny Appleseed"" effect.  The photo below was taken at the Supreme Court during a protest to try to encourage a recount in Florida during the Bush-Gore fiasco.  This was really my ""awakening"" toward how much politics affect our lives. I was an Independent most of my adult life, however, I made the decision to register as a Democrat and get off the fence.  I never looked back.

WHY ME???This is the question I mulled over a long time before creating this Go Fund Me Request.  My dear sister responded with the answer, “Why Not Me!”  To be honest, I know that there are many people who struggle with life situations that go beyond mine.  I’ll try to make my best case of why I am worthy of this funding.  Then I’ll leave it to you to decide.I am a caring individual who is loyal to close friends and family.When significant people in my life developed terminal illnesses, I was there for them 100% even when others turned away.  Care-giving was one of the most physically and mentally demanding things I’ve ever done, but also very gratifying and some of the most meaningful experiences in my life.  Anyone who has gone through the experience knows they are changed forever.1.       In 1995, my parents, who lived in Denver became critically ill. My mother suffered from Alzheimer’s for several years, but her condition deteriorated and she was placed in a nursing home, prior to my father collapsing and being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. I flew to Denver to assist my family with my father's care.  He was placed in hospice care and was able to return to his home of 60 years.  I became his hospice caregiver assisted by my sister. My brother continued to work.  My father was my night and day for two months.  My mother's condition worsened quickly in the nursing home and she died in June and my father followed in July. We were devastated. I stayed in Denver for six months to assist my family with the estate.2.       Then in 2000, my ex-husband was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.  He lived in Bradenton, Fl.  When we met he was a handsome 28 year old radio newsman and I was 17-year-old dancer, so at one point in my life he represented fairy tale love, until I realized he was a frog, not a prince. We were married 21 years before we divorced.  He was a recovering alcoholic and had virtually no one significant left in his life by the time he got sick.  Although, my daughter and I had stopped communicating with him, we both agreed that this was a chapter of our lives we needed to finish the right way, so we decided to care for him.  Again, I became his hospice caregiver and he was able to stay home during his illness.  I had my own business then, so I had to arrange it around my trips to Florida.  I would work Tuesday through Thursday and fly to Florida to care for him Friday through Monday. Of course, as he got sicker, my daughter and I spent more time with him.  After going through chemotherapy and radiation, he died on January 22, 2002.(After I returned to DC, I started working again.  I was working on a contract to the Department of Labor then. I was blessed because others believed in my capabilities.)4.       In April of 2002, my neighbor, Alice, who I knew for 17 years and was a mother figure to me, announced that her pancreatic cancer had taken a turn for the worse.  My heart sank…I loved this woman.  Her sister from New Hampshire visited her and assisted her with her initial care. The day before her sister left to go home, she and Alice made the decision to sell her unit and move to an assisted living facility.  Alice called me that afternoon quite upset.  She told me that she sold her unit.  Being from New Hampshire, Alice was a very stoic woman, however, she could hardly speak between her tears, when she told me about selling her unit. After we hung up, all I could do is cry.  I knew that I had the skills to help her, but it was just too soon after my ex-husbands death to consider it.  As I worked through my tears, I knew that I HAD to help because of my love and respect for her.  I called her and told her that she wouldn’t have to move, and I could care for her.  She was touched but called me that night and said that she had made the right decision after all.  I told her that when the time came, I would be there for her.  Her sisters, who were in there 80’s, lived out of state.  To make a long story short, her conditioned worsened in August and I began to stay the night with her at the request of her sister.  Her sister flew back to help with her care in September.  She slept on the sofa, I slept on the floor with a baby monitor, so that I could hear Alice.  She passed in late September.Then last year, a dear friend and neighbor, Bob, who I had known for over 15 years,  succumbed Parkinson's Disease.  His care took an all-out effort on the part of his family and they asked if I would assist with his care since I lived so close.  For four years, we were a close team working to care for him.  I wanted my role as a friend, to  help him enjoy his life up to the end.  We had a lot of laughs along the way.  I miss him.Being someone who had to take care of herself, I worked hard and with passion since I was 17. Here are a few highlights from my work journey:After literally starting from scratch with a high school education,  I founded two businesses, one lasted 20 years and the other 15 years.  My first business was a mission of my love of dance and that passion led to my own dance business in Iowa. I loved every minute of it and it grew to three studio locations.  I had to leave it all behind when my life was at risk, if I stayed in Iowa.  Starting over in DC, was humbling to say the least, but I knew I had to work hard to succeed and thrive. I learned every software application possible and became proficient enough to start teaching software classes. One of the more significant opportunities, offered to me, was with a Government contractor  teaching software applications to thousands of students at the Pentagon. During this period of time, I was working five jobs: Technical Training, teaching online classes and hosting a regular chatroom shift on America Online, DJing at Weddings and teaching dance at a local studio on Saturdays.  Needless, to say I wasn't home much.  I was promoted to Manager of the Training Task before I yearned to be independent again.I started a computer consulting business in 1991.  It was definitely scary, but exhilarating, too.  For the first year, I supplemented my earnings by teaching computer classes at Microcenter.  I built my business one client at a time and it grew and lasted 15 years.Some highlights of that period, were working at the White House performing technical writing services-first for the Y2K efforts,  and then to assist with the transition efforts from Clinton to Bush.  I also worked on contract to the Department of Labor assisting the People Power Team with obtaining their Exhibit 300 funding request.I take pride in the effort it took to achieve so many milestones, however, here I am...  I did everything possible to have some security as I aged, but unfortunately life has other plans.Here's a great example of life's ""interruptions ""...when I started the job on the Army contract, my 12 year old car's transmission went down, so I decided to buy another better used one.  Soon after I bought the car, I had to be rushed to the hospital with a severe Diverticulitis attack that almost killed me and required emergency surgery, then in 2 months I needed another surgery. Shortly after surgery, I caught a nasty, dangerous infection from my previous stay at the hospital which put me back in the hospital for another 16 days. During a 4 year period, from 2006-2010, I had 4 surgeries, and a 16 day stay in the hospital.  I continued working each time I recovered until 2009, when my employer decided to let me go due to a ""workforce reduction.”  During that period, my dear daughter, who was helping with my care, drove my new car, more than I did.I will be so grateful and humbled by any assistance you deem me worthy of.  Depending on my Landlady, my present housing could change rapidly, so I need to prepare myself for a stressful few months.   I haven't received a formal notice yet.   I'm also having trouble paying my bills, so the stress is constantly there.  I've been doing freelance PowerPoint work, to supplement my Social Security, however, it's sporatic. My energy and ambitions have changed as I've aged.  I was hoping to have a life beyond work before I die.  In Trump's America, I'm not sure that's possible any more.  That's why its so important to me to continue to resist.

However, this time, it will be different! So, your donations will be much appreciated. I'm going to represent the 10th district, LGBT people, and young Democrats across the country. Not only will your donation help me attend the convention, it will help me cross off something from my bucket list - meeting the next President of the United States: Hillary Clinton!"

If people don’t care, they don’t vote.  We make videos to make people care.Help us make 20 more before election day!

 

OUR STORIES

All summer long, our videos have reached tens of thousands of people in districts and states where votes matter most.

By focusing on the personal stories of candidates and people directly affected by issues like climate change, healthcare, gun control, and the economy, we put faces on the issues of this election, and create an emotional connection to the act of voting.

When we're able to share stories like Carter's below, who we met in Virginia while interviewing Jennifer Wexton (VA10) and Leslie Cockburn (VA05), we help show people that their votes do matter, and that when they vote, they're speaking up for the people they care about and the issues that matter most to their lives.



Now, we're raising funding to produce and release another twenty videos in the two months between now and election day, November 6th.

We've done it for over 50 videos so far, and we're committed to doing even more with #20for2018!

 

YOUR SUPPORT

Covering this election is a labor of love, and your support provides the means to cover expenses like travel, basic overhead, and promotional targeting of the videos to voters in the races that we feature.  



Every $500 we raise is another video we can produce, release, and promote.  Some videos will cost less than that, and some will cost more, but this amount represents an average required to meet our goal.

We've organized a group of nearly 100 talented creators across the country who are ready to do as much as possible by election day. We'll make as many videos as we have funding for in the coming weeks.

 

WHO WE ARE

36campaigns is a grassroots social media news publisher focusing the attention of Democrat and Independent voters on thirty-six critical congressional races in 2018. Our videos help tell the stories of those races, and the issues defining this incredibly important midterm.

 

Thank you for for your support!

Why do we ask you to join our Florida citizens volunteer people's peaceful  Florida Citizen's Right To Petition movement?  Given the number of Florida voters who have signed petitions or went to vote for or against ballot initiative petition issues over the years, we believe most Florida citizens will join together and act to retain this right we treasure.Our nonpartisan ad-hoc volunteer group, FL CITIZENS RIGHT TO PETITION, opposes Florida House Bill-5 (HB-5) that shreds Florida citizens’ inherent state constitutional rights by seeking to stop us from putting our own Florida State constitutional amendment laws on the ballot for a vote.  It seems some Florida politicians believe they should have this right, but not the people.  Not to protect our environment!  Not for fair election boundaries!  Not for medical marijuana!  Not even to restore the right of people to vote, if convicted of a felony, despite serving their sentence and wishing to rejoin us as a full citizen with rights. HB-5 blocks our rights as citizens, while corporations, millionaires and politicians now will be the only ones with the real ability to conduct petition drives.  Therefore, they decide what is on the ballot to vote for in the future, not the voters.Our ballot initiative petition process was designed so ordinary everyday citizens to have this ""right"" to bypass politicians as a means to approve laws that ""we,"" the citizens, desire, but our elected representatives repeatedly refused to pass.Look what happened the after our 4th of July weekend holiday, on July 8th, 2019!  Not one citizen volunteer petition campaign continuing on after Independence Day!   Only corporate sponsored or millionaire owned petition campaigns.Using paid petition canvassers only; to collect voter signed petitions.  Politicians just passed HB-5 to push aside our once inherent fundamental constitutional ballot initiative right to write a law; sign petitions; and go vote to approve our law.HB-5's abrupt changes impacted on-going petition drives; ending or suspending  the opportunity of Florida voters being able to vote in 2020 on several very popular issues, like Medicaid For Low-Income Adults, Background Checks For Buying Weapons, Ban on Assault Rifles, Solar Energy and the Right Of Adults To Cannabis; which fully legalizes all plants of the genus, Cannabis, and right of adults in Florida to possess, use and grow your own at home,  just to mention a few.Moreover, HB-5 suppresses the vote of certain voters in our 2020 election.  HB-5 was initiated in the middle of an election 2 year cycle, when ballot initiative petitions were all still being circulated and signed to hand in for the 2020 election.  But we were stopped with six months left in the cycle.  Several ballot initiatives sponsors suspended or ended petition drives for 2020.  The above noted petitions, if on the 2020 ballot, were expected to bring many voters to vote.The HB-5 law was designed to discourage and disillusion people from voting. HB-5 limits progressive, minority and independent voter turnout in our 2020 Florida election. It can help explain a lot!  It seems HB-5 was enacted in the improper way that it was done to ""tip"" 2020 election results in Florida.  It is well documented that petitions bring out the voters. When an issue is important to ordinary citizens, they show up to vote. Of course they do, because 766,200+ people have already signed a petition to get their concern on the ballot.  Independent, Republicans, Democrats, Green Party, Libertarian Party and so on . . . it does not make a difference. This was a constitutional right shared and used by us all. The right not to have our elections manipulated is a right we all share.Now consider that ballot initiative petition processes have also been restricted in several other states, by state officials to alter 2020 state and national election result outcomes; in Arkansas, in Michigan, it North & South Dakota and Utah.This is may be why HB-5 was passed now; with little thought as to what was actually being done, under false pretenses, by sleight of hand maneuvers.  I speak as an Independent Voter, on behalf of other voters, when I say our constitutional amendment ballot initiative petition process is not someone's special interest playpen. The Floridian people's rights and best interests are not anyone's playpen play toys.  It is why many Floridians have joined us already.  We need you, too.Gov. DeSantis, who pushed for this law, recently appointed three new Supreme Court Justices who all belong to the Federalist Society; suggesting the new Judges may support this attempt to solidify the hold politicians would have over us.   Whether Democrat or Republican, ETC . . . this is an impermissible coup that threatens to eviscerates many rights.I oppose this as an Independent Voter (NPA) in Florida.  As a Florida citizen volunteer who has collected a variety of citizen-led constitutional ballot initiative petitions, I bypass any and all partisan Florida politicians once again.  I go to federal court. We retain well-known top Civil Rights Attorney, William Sheppard's law firm from Jacksonville, Florida to file this legal court challenge to HB-5 to save several popular proposed laws as well as our state constitutional ballot petition process. Bill Sheppard is still ranked as one of the five best Civil Rights and First Amendment attorneys in the USA.  Last year, he won the 2018 ""Florida Best Attorney Award"" once more.  I know and trust Bill Sheppard is the best there is to handle this case.                                                                                                              Once filed, we request the Judge to issue a ""Stay Order"" to stop enforcement of  HB-5; allowing us to collect our ballot initiative petitions, all 766,200 of them, as our case is being decided in federal court.  Other petitions will also become available, when the Federal Judge's ""Stay Order"" is issued!  These petition collective drives could resume.We have strong reasons to believe our request for a ""stay"" will be granted, given the way the politicians interfered with the rights of the Floridian people to vote on these issues in 2020, and the questionable way this law was enacted.  We further believe HB-5 will be overturned for violating our constitutional rights. The impact of suppressing the vote now an issue! We are forming a people's peaceful ""political revolution"" by creating our own county petition teams to pass laws we all approve of enacting.  We collect voter signed petitions.  As we conduct our petition drive, we find good candidates who support the people of  Florida and our issues.  We vote to approve our new ballot initiative laws and elect our candidates.People in the State of Florida need to take these matters in hand.  Join our legal challenge to HB-5 by donating  $3 if you can, and print out, sign and pass along petitions if you can; ask those voters to do the same ""sign one . . . pass two along . . . .""

Hi, my name is Trey and on June 19th I was honored to be selected as an At-Large Delegate to represent Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia during the week of July 24th.  I believe that I will make Washington State proud at the Convention because in addition to the sincere passion that the Democratic Party inspires in its followers, I also bring strong leadership skills and personal diversity to the table. 

Throughout the caucausing process and in district meetings I have built bridges of communication and mutual respect between the supporters of both candidates.  In order to avoid a catastrophic Republican presidency, Democrats must unite with respectful dialogue and honest understanding.  I have demonstrated that I'm the delegate that can help make this happen. 

I am also an Asian-American, a US Army Veteran, and a proud supporter of the LGBT community, all of which further enables me to create productive alliances among Democrats. 

As a respectful, engaging, and diverse leader, I am thrilled to represent Washington State at the National Convention.  I am here to humbly ask for your support with the funds needed to make that happen.  All funds raised by July 31st will be used to offset plane fare, ground transportation, hotel accomodations, and meals in Philadelphia.  In the event that the funds raised exceed the costs incurred, any overages will be donated to the Washington State Democratic Party. 

Thank you for you support in this historic opportunity.

Since the summer of 2015 - when I became chair of the YDA's Disability Caucus - I have been able to build a structure that didn't exist before, have strengthened our presence within the national organization, hosted guest speaker calls for hundreds of interested Democrats, hosted a disability forum in Delaware this past spring, and have worked really hard to be the face of the Disability Caucus - and, really, young Democrats - outside of YDA.  I've had some wonderful experiences over the last 18 months and want to continue making you all proud.  
Your donation will help me participate in two events this year - the YDA National Spring Conference (in Arizona ) March 24th - 26th and then the National Convention (in Texas).  Your donations will help me pay for flights and hotel costs.  
Attending the Spring Conference will give me the ability to campaign to continue on as Disability Chair before the National Convention. I will oversee the Disability Caucus meeting during the Spring Conference (stay tuned for who my special guest is)!  I really need this experience and those face-to-face contacts to be successful in carrying on this mission and continuing to serve in this capacity; and that's why I am asking for your help.

District 8 is comprised of Alexandria, Arlington, Falls Church, and portions of Fairfax County. Based on the results of the March 1st Virginia primary, District 8 was allocated 3 Bernie Sanders delegates to Hillary Clinton’s 5. I have been selected as the sole female Bernie Sanders delegate for these crucial Democratic strongholds in Northern Virginia, and am thrilled to be a representative of my community, along with Mark Wiznitzer and Boyd Walker. I am asking for your financial assistance, so that I can finance the expenses associated with attending the June 18th Virginia Democratic Convention in Richmond, and the July 25-28th Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. As many of you know, I was very recently employed as the Operations Director for the campaign here in VA, and after the expiration of my contract with the campaign, I thought serving one of the campaign’s delegates to Philly was the best way to keep Feeling the Bern! A lot of you already know this about me, but, I’m originally from the South Bronx, and moved to Virginia in 2012, after graduating from St. Bonaventure University with a BA in political science. As a graduating senior, my first venture into politics was working on President Obama’s re-election campaign. I moved to VA to pursue a graduate degree at GW in Political Management. While at GW, I worked for Will Smith’s campaign in Maryland, and worked on Patrick Hope’s congressional bid for a short stint. After graduating, I was a Field Organizer in the Hunter Mill District in Fairfax County for Senator Mark Warner, where I successfully mobilized a turnout of nearly 49%, ranking the 2nd highest in the county. Last year, I was offered a role on Senator Sanders’ South Carolina team. I started out as a Regional Field Director, then moved into a role as Scheduling and Advance Director, before becoming the state’s Faith-Based Outreach Director, ultimately ending as Virginia’s Operations Director. On the campaign, I had the pleasure to work with Campaign Manager Jeff Weaver, Senior Adviser Phil Fiermonte, SC State Director Chris Covert, VA State Director Peter Clerkin, and Marcus Ferrell, the Southeastern Political Director for African American Outreach, and so many more. As VA Operations Director, I opened up 5 offices and managed 24 staff, and a budget of $265,000. I made sure volunteers had what they needed to assist Bernie and his dream of a political revolution. I stand before you guys today, thankful for your support and your faith in my ability to adequately represent the Virginia 8th! Our Democratic delegates decided  to send representation that coincides with the coalition of voters the Senator is trying to turn out, in order to secure a win in this primary! I know that I am best able to represent Virginia, as well as give a voice to the coalition of young, independent, and minority voters that are the source of the Senator’s strength at the ballot box and in the polls. Polls consistently show that Senator Sanders is the best Democrat to take on Donald Trump in the fall. I feel that as an African American female millennial, and a previous campaign staffer, I have the grit and drive to best represent these passionate voters, alongside the 108 other members of the Virginia delegation in Philadelphia this July. According to the misleading media, the Senator apparently lacks supporters who look like me, but here I am ready and willing to give his vision a voice. Your support would solidify that vision. Best Wishes,Ashley Bynum"

WE HAVE RAISED ENOUGH TO MAKE THE TRIP POSSIBLE! If you would still like to contribute to someone, PLEASE consider contributing to Keli Vereb on the Rules Committee . Keli is a Steelworker and a Pittsburgher, and because the Rules Committee has such an important job, they are required to stay 2 days longer than the Delegates, which means she has to spend $2940 for hotel alone. Bernie is relying on the Rules Committee to help shape future elections, including the removal of Superdelegates from the electoral process, passing legislation for automatic voter registration at age 18, and the creation of open primaries for all states. Keli's participation is crucial! From the hearts of Alex, Beth, Greg, Carolyn, and Maddie, we want to extend our gratitude and love for you all. This movement has never been about a single voice or a single candidate, it's about the people uniting to fight the many wrongs in our society. Please keep fighting with us, and we promise to fight for all of you - both on the Convention floor and after! #seeyouinphillyWe are Beth Ussery and Alex Austin,  two of the founders of Burghers for Bernie, a grassroots organization dedicated to electing Bernie Sanders as President! If you don't know Burghers, Beth is also a co-chair of PA Labor for Bernie, and Alex is the head of Pitt Students for Bernie. Basically if you've been to a Bernie event in the city of Pittsburgh, chances are you've probably met us, bought a t-shirt off of us, and/or received a high-five from us. And we think you are awesome! Today, we're here to ask you for some help in funding our journey to the Democratic National Convention in Philly! In addition to ourselves, we're also raising money for the at-large delegates supporting Bernie from District 14: Greg Schaffer, Madeline Whitehill, and Carolyn Kazdin.  That's 5 delegates who need your help!! Alex and I were both fortunate enough to be elected to serve as  pledged delegates to Bernie at the Democratic National Convention this July. So before we say anything else, thank you for giving us this YUUUUGE honor! We will do our best to represent you all, to be your voice on the Convention floor, and to stand strong for our platform and our candidate! Not only will we continue to fight for Bernie until the very last vote is cast, but we promise to continue to push Pittsburgh's Progressive movement long after this election cycle is over. Now, ""regular"" people don't usually get picked to be delegates. This is an honor reserved for mayors (our own Bill Peduto is a delegate for Hillary) and the political elite. It's viewed as a status symbol, or a reward for helping the Democratic Party to raise a lot of money. Each delegate is required to pay for their own transportation, food, and lodging. We know you're thinking, ""Yinz only gotta go across the state, how much could it cost?!"" Well lemme tell ya: the hotel alone costs $2100 (proof ). Due to the incredibly tight security perimeter surrounding the convention center and the  need to get our daily security credentials before the meetings begin, the Sanders Campaign has made it mandatory that all delegates stay at the hotel designated solely for the PA Democrats.  We have a friend who's going to New Zealand and her plane ticket across the world is cheaper than our trip across Pennsylvania.  For most middle-class folks (like Beth) or amazing, single dad-slash-Air Force Veteran-slash-fulltime college students (like Alex), the cost of the trip is too much.  But the Sanders campaign chose us as delegates because they know how passionate we are about the cause, and because they know that we will do everything we can at the Convention  to push Bernie and his platform through to the nomination. Together, we are stronger than the Billionaires! Help us get to the convention by chipping in whatever you can. If we exceed our goal, we will use the extra money to help other PA Bernie delegates reach theirs! Thank you, and we're honored to represent you! Beth and Alex"

Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my funding page for the National Democratic Convention! As you may have figured out by now, I have been elected to be a delgegate to the DNC representing Bernie Sanders in Philadelphia this July.  What this means is I have a very expensive but CRUCIALLY important trip to plan! It's important to me for several reasons. 1.  I am a PRIME example of the kind of disenfranchised and cynical young person in our political system. Although I was a registered Democrat the day I turned 18, I had lost faith in the system and removed myself entirely from the process. This campaign has motivated and inspired me to take a PROACTIVE role in my community and my nation. 2. I am not a big celebrity, smooth talking politician, or some other type of big wig. But despite my seemingly low status of influence, I share important values with millions of YOU! It's these values that inspire me to fight passionately for our poor and disenfranchised in our communities. It's these values that motivate me to stand with my LGBT brothers and sister. And it's these values that give ME of all people the opportunity to journey to Philadelphia and stand with thousands of others and we demand a CHANGE in the way things are done in our country! I waited a little bit to launch this page because I have plans to do some other even more creative and engaging fundraising efforts in the coming month. But until I get those details worked out, I wanted to give you the opportunity to pitch in what you can. Some of the money you give early on will help me to do some even more creative fundraising down the line. Fundraising that I hope will first and foremost result in spreading BERNIE'S message! I thank you in advance for your donations and look forward to keeping in touch with you all through social media as I set out to ""Bring The BERN to Philadelphia""!"

Is it possible that these new members got elected because of their hatred of Trump? By simply jumping on the ""I hate trump bandwagon"" are they able to push their socialist ideals on our country?PROBLEMBit-by-bit, our nation is being shaken from the foundation it was built on of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, by attacks on capitalism, religious freedoms, personal rights and so much more. This is taking place because FAKE NEWS has permeated the fabric of our culture. Consequently, the ones that are succumbing to the rhetoric and propaganda are not just the liberals and millennial generation, but even moderate and conservative Republicans. The days of unbiased reporting are long gone.Look how Bernie Sanders shifted our country and tore into the fabric of our capitalistic ideals of freedom and liberty by building a following of thousands and thousands of self-entitled supporters. Not to mention he just announced he is also running in 2020.SOLUTION How do you stop FAKE NEWS? You tell the truth, based on facts, not opinions. And, it all starts with the highest office in our land, the presidency.The presidency is our launching point and this is critical, because never in the history of our country has our president been attacked by such viscous blatant propaganda from the media. Trump’s Winning Report will fight back because our country has lost all respect for the office, and now we will expose the truth of how our president is winning based on facts, not opinions.

THE DETAILSWe will create a 13 Part Video Series, each with 3 parts explaining Trump’s wins. We are going inside. We are going to find out the truth on several topics: - How Trump’s tax plan helps create businesses- How Trump is beating China on trade- How his economic incentive for some communities works- How he saved money on NATO- His Buy American - and Hire American- Other New Trade Deals- How Trump is Creating Manufacturing Jobs- How the forest clearing works and why he signed an executive order- And many more...

Trump. So please, we ask you to donate what you can as we want to go in-depth as much as possible and prove to the naysayers what Trump has done. So when these Democrats in 2020 ask you what he has done, you can be informed of the answers or tell them to watch this series to learn the truth.To make Trump’s Winning Report work, we need to hire:- Writers- Producers- Story makers- Journalists- Video editors- Researchers- Support staff- And moreDonate what you can, share with all your friends and family, and finally be sure you subscribe to our youtube channel, ""Trump’s Winning Report."" If you cannot help by donating at this time, please share this message with everyone you know, and of course, subscribe to our youtube channel.

When Senator Sanders announced he was running for President I like most others didn't know a lot about him.

I am deeply dedicated and hardworking and will be honored to represent those who voted for me while in Philadelphia as a delegate.I started volunteering and organizing for Bernie back in 2015 because he was saying what I knew needed to be said but I never thought I would live to hear a Democratic Presidential candidate say. What resonates with me as a small business owner is that unfettered capitalism and the influence of wealth in campaigns is ruining our economy and our society, and Bernie Sanders’ policy proposals are the solution.I was lucky enough to be able to volunteer full time for the 2 weeks Bernie's staff was in our state working to win our caucuses. I’d been working hard in preparation for our caucus for months and am honored to have been designated by staff as Bernie’s sub caucus chair for Boise / Ada County CD2. Driving in Bernie's motorcade in Idaho Falls and serving as a sub-caucus chair at the largest caucus in our nation’s history are two experiences I will never forget, but the friends I have made and the work that so many of us across the state have done together are much more rewarding.When I started organizing in 2015, my goal was to get people active in the movement and give them the tools to make a difference and become leaders in the movement themselves. It warms my soul to see so many people around the state getting active in the revolution and stepping up to be grassroots leaders in their communities. The power of this movement and the deep beauty of people working together for a revolution humbles me. When 1500 Idahoans came together to March for Bernie I felt like the earth moved. I am overjoyed to have played a roll in Bernie’s success in Idaho and to have worked with you to make that happen. Congrats to everyone on 78%!!I’m a bit of a wonk. I’ve been studying rules for months to make sure our delegation has every tool possible to be thoroughly prepared for our state convention. Already I was fortunate to win an argument with party officials at the caucus that allowed us to include many delegate ballots that would have been thrown out. I was recently surprised by the party naming me the Credentials Committee Chair, and have used the opportunity to fight for an inclusive convention. Several important decisions have been made by the committee which may affect you and I am proud of the relationships which I, as a long time unaffiliated voter, have built within the Democratic party and its staff. Our delegation must arrive in Philadelphia with a strong plan and a sound strategy to ensure we make the most of this opportunity. I am determined to be a dedicated voice for Bernie and his platform at our National Convention, and I need your help to get me there. As both the Democratic Chairman of Idaho's Credentials Committee, and an unaffiliated voter I have a unique voice and ability to help counter those who will challenge the credentials of the many Delegates who are not registered Democrats at our National Convention. Voter suppression tactics of this kind cannot be allowed to succeed and I promise I am prepared to ensure Bernie delegates are fully credentialed and their votes counted! I promise to represent you and Bernie well. Your support means the world to me."

But we didn’t care. LGBTrump saw something that the media, the party establishments, and the LGBT+ Left did not want to see – a candidate who unlocked Americans from the chains of identity politics and gave a voice to working America. Our plan is to usher in a new era of politics – an era in which your identity does not determine your ideology and an era is which the needs of the nation are placed before the needs of special interests. To the Beltway bandits this is scary as hell. To the American people this is a liberation of unprecedented heights.Our message is clear: GAYS DO NOT HAVE TO BE DEMOCRATS!!!We welcome EVERYONE to join our movement! We have some of the BEST SUPPORTERS out there who are Gay, Straight, Bisexual, Trans, Black, White, Purple, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Asian, Mexican, LEGAL Immigrants, etc. and we couldn’t be more thrilled to have such a diverse group of Patriotic Americans who share the same goal: to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!I am Marky Hutt. I am the founder of 'LGBTrump - Gays For Trump' and I am a PROUD gay conservative. I’m ashamed & embarrassed that I once defended & enabled the LGBTQIA+ community, a group that once demanded equality, tolerance, & acceptance, yet they REFUSE to show that same respect for others that may hold different political views or beliefs, & god forbid you wear a red hat!There isn’t a day that goes by where liberals don’t call us “TRAITORS, bigots, self-loathing, self-hating homophobes, self-hating anti-semites, Islamophobes, transphobic, racists, fascists, “alt-right,” white supremacists, & Nazis” We LOVE our supporters simply for their constant support and for sticking with us, we’re a group that isn’t like the others, we definitely are a different breed in politics and we take FULL PRIDE in that and we wear that badge with HONOR!Thank you for sticking with us as we continue to share and spread our message as we try to expand and grow our group!

Today, her biggest concern is the education of her children.  In Syria her school age children did very well in school but since fleeing the war they have not been able to attend school.  They have missed a year.   The village where I am staying is called Btekhnai.  This year the Village Council requested and received a waiver from the central government to allow Syrian Children to attend the public schools in Btekhnai.   Btekhnai is the exception in Lebanon.  Most other villages in Lebanon and the central government in Lebanon fear that if they educate the Syrians they will not want to leave Lebanon.  Btekhnai doesn’t agree and in fact believes if they do not educate the children it will lead to children seeking other outlets such as vandalism, crime and worst of all as the children are old enough they will return to fighting – possibly in Lebanon.  Btekhnai is a small village of about 900 plus year round.  During the summer months the Villages population increases by about 3,500 people most Americans of Lebanese descent returning to enjoy their historic family homes in the fresh cool mountain air, to visit family and friends or to attend weddings.   They have no relationship to these children other than most are typical Americans (Democrat and Republican) that see an opportunity to help make a real difference in the world.I believe this is why Btekhnai is the exception.   In addition to giving their own money they have been successful in working with the United Nations and other NGO to provide basic facilities for Children.  I believe that out of this humanitarian crisis there is an opportunity.  An opportunity to educate these children to help them build a better Syria.  Use of Funds: This fund will be used to buy books, backpacks, paper, pencils, school supplies in general and learning aids.  Funds will only be used for this purpose.  I plan to use my own resources to arrange for delivery of the supplies.   All children up to 12th grade, Lebanese and Syrian, attending school in Btekhnai will be provided supplies (as long as they last) with the Syrian Children given first priority.  Funds not used during the year will be carried over to the following year.  Who am I?You may want to know who is this guy trying to raise money for children and how can I trust him to use my money wisely.   I am one of those “crazy” Americans that return to Lebanon for the mountain air and to honor my parents whose dream it was that my brother and sisters and I would use the family home which has been in our family for over a hundred years.   I was born in Kingsport, TN but grew up in Florida.  My father was Lebanese and my mother was a Virginian (German/Irish) from Dunganon, VA not too far from Kingsport.  They met during World War II when my father, who was fighting with Patton’s third army, was on leave.  My brother and Sisters grew up as typical American kids.  I graduated from Cocoa High School and went on to get an undergraduate degree in Public Administration and a Master’s Degree in Public Policy  from the University of Central Florida.  After college I become a public official serving as City Manager in several cities in Florida and eventually ended up in the private sector as a real estate developer and entrepreneur.  The children are the future and I would like to influence their education in a positive way.  If you agree please contribute as much as you can to this small fund."

€57 raised of €8,900                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/cambridge-university-master-of-laws-llm-fees, ,From Sorbonne to Cambridge LLM with your help,"Created May 4, 2019","


Dear All, 5 years… It took me 5 years to finally get the desired invitation from the University of Cambridge to pursue my Master’s degree there.I graduated from Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University and French University in Armenia with academic excellence. Currently, I am a graduate student at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, which is among 25 best universities by law studies.It is noteworthy that it was thanks to my academic achievements that I have been granted a 75% tuition waiver scholarship at the French University of Armenia and other scholarships that helped me make my way to Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University. During my studies, I was honored to be taught by Armenian and French practitioners who showed how to combine practical skills with doctrinal interpretations, at the same time sharing both Armenian and French values. Among my tutors were the General Prosecutor of the Republic of Armenia, Deputy Chairman of the Investigative Committee of the Republic of Armenia and other practitioners who worked in the law enforcement system. I believe that having such lecturers have conveyed me theoretical and practical knowledge to continue my education in the University of Cambridge.During my education process, I have managed to conduct numerous researches on law. My scientific work includes topics like plea bargaining, the retroactivity of the decisions of state high courts, the incompatibility of the parole mechanism of Wales and England with the European and International documents etc. I believe that this course will later create a solid foundation for undertaking research in these fields, as well as in others, more thoroughly.It is noteworthy that my theoretical knowledge has also been successfully applied in many domestic and international moot courts, where I have had different achievements (e.g. Jessup International Moot Court to name but a few). I am sure that my previous experience of this kind will help me concentrate on practical issues during my studies.Starting from my school years, I have participated in more than 200 professional projects. Thus, I have built and maintained professional relationships during these programs not only within my country, but also abroad, including both European and Asian countries, such as South Korea. Studying abroad also has an important role in creating professional relationships.I believe it is important to state that I consider myself an active member of the civil society, who has long-term goals, strives to be open to any new ideas. After entering the university, in the first month I was elected as a member of the Student Council where I was the representative of 120 students. At the end of the first year, members of the Student Council, who were representing several thousand students, elected me as a Person-Responsible for the Development of Education and Science, in the framework of which I have completed corresponding courses at the National Quality Assurance Center, becoming an expert in education quality. In the second year of my university education, I was elected Secretary-General of the Student Council, thanks to which my leadership qualities have improved, since I led many events, with dozens of people involved in the organizing teams.I was a member of the Armenian National Students' Association, where I have been in the Scientific Committee.The desire to continue my education at the University of Cambridge was further strengthened by studying its infrastructure and lecturers’ work. Particularly, I would like to work with Dr Antje du Bois-Pedain, lecturer on Criminal Law. I have read several scientific articles written by her and found out that we share points of view in almost all crucial issues. I think it would be fruitful to carry out research with her.Firstly, being interested in human rights and criminal law, I am going to work as a prosecutor after my Master’s degree program. I am convinced that this course will give me certain skills, which will be prop in future prosecutorial activities. As far as the work as a prosecutor is concerned, for me it is a means to fight against crime. During my internships, I have encountered many professional difficulties and, by overcoming them, I became more inspired to contribute to fair and equitable criminal justice, as well as efficient protection of citizens against crime. Secondly, it is important to state that I have accepted the position of the president of the NGO “Justice and the Rule of Law”, within the framework of which we have tried to contribute to the establishment of a competent civil society, by informing people about their rights through various events (seminars, conferences, trainings, legal advice). Human rights protection has a primary role within the framework of my career, and the NGO is an effective tool for its implementation. After gaining my Master's degree, I am going to enlarge the activity spectrum of the NGO I lead, by further expanding the circle of people whose rights our organization tries to protect.Thirdly, I am aiming at transferring my knowledge and skills to students, by mean of lecturing in the domain of law at different HEIs. I am planning to design a course on criminal law, human rights and lecture it in Armenian universities. In my country there is a huge demand of scholars of criminal law and human rights; therefore, I believe that the selected course will be the right pathway for me to develop the study field of the discipline I am concerned with. For me it is momentous to work as a practitioner and a lecturer at the same time, as I consider it important to exchange knowledge between generations.Unfortunately, studying in Cambridge is very expensive. The cost for the full Master's degree is 40,000 Pounds sterling (53,000 US dollars). With scholarships and family support, I am able to pay only 43,000 US dollars. Thus, this fundraising is aimed at collecting the remaining 10,000 US dollars (7,600 Pound sterling). I only need to meet financial condition.Now, educational fundraising can be the only means by which I can continue my education at the University of Cambridge.EDUCATION 2018-present:           Paris 1 P anthéon-Sorbonne University                                             (Criminal Law and Criminal Sciences) 2015-2018:                Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University  (LAW) 2014-2018:                French University in Armenia    (LAW) 2003-2014:                N 108 School Complementary EducationOct. 2015 -Mar. 2016:The National Centre for Professional                                      Education Quality Assurance Foundation                                      (Quality Assurance Education Specialist) EXPERIENCES Feb. 2016 -present:   President of the NGO                                     “Justice and the Rule of Law” InternshipsJan. 2018-Sept. 2018:Department of Investigation of Especially                                     Important Cases of the Prosecutor General’s                                     Office of the Republic of ArmeniaOct. 2017-Dec. 2017:Erebuni District of the Prosecutor's OfficeJun. 2016-Mar. 2017:Yerevan Investigation Department of                                     the Investigative Committee of the                                    Republic of ArmeniaFeb. 2015-May 2015:Department of International Legal Assistance                                     of the Investigative Committee of                                     the Republic of Armenia  MEMBERSHIPS          Mar. 2016-May 2018: UFAR Law student council-member of FOUNDING BOARDOct. 2016-2017:      European Youth Parliament-memberOct. 2014-May 2016: The Armenian National Students' Association-member of the Scientific Committee Oct. 2015-May 2016: UFAR Student Council -General Secretary Sept. 2014-Oct. 2015: UFAR Student Council-in charge of educational and scientific development Sept. 2011-May 2014: N 108 School Council-Vice-President    CONFERENCES, SEMINARS AND TRAININGS 28 Mar. 2019:    “Democracy without Democrats” Paris, France(Professeur Tom GINSBURG, de l'université de Chicago) 25 Fev. 2019:     “L'identité du droit public latino-américain au temps de la mondialisation du droit” Paris, France(Professeur de droit à la Universidad del Rosario (Colombie)) 25 Jun. 2019:      “Droit et Science” Paris, France(la Sorbonne Student Law Review) 24 Jun. 2019      “Le recours constitutionnel d'amparo en protection des droits fondamentaux en Amérique Latine” Paris, France(La Section Française de Institut Ibéroaméricain de Droit Constitutionnel) 15 Dec. 2018:      “Le Kremlin et la vague réactionnaire en Europe” Paris, France(l'Association des droits de l'Homme de la Sorbonne (ADHS) en partenariat avec les associations ""Russie Libertés"" et ""Ukraine Action"") 04 Dec. 2018:      “Droits et valeurs dans le système juridique de l'Union européenne” Paris, France(Professeur Roberto Baratta, Professeur de droit à l'Université de Macerata en Italie) 13 Nov. 2018:          “Cybersecurity: Issues for State and Individual” Paris, France(University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne) 12 Oct. 2018:          “The Right to Use Force (Jus Ad Bellum)” Paris, France (Mutoy MUBIALA,  University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne) 04 Oct. 2018:          “Legal Process” Paris, France(Thierry Revet, Bertrand Périer, Louis Boré,   University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne) 26-28 Sept. 2018:   “Introduction to Common Law” Paris, France(Bernard Rix, Queen Mary University of London) 11 Sept. 2018:       “How Will Artificial Intelligence Change the Legal World ?” Paris, France(Queen Mary University of London) 06 Mar. 2018:         “Provisional Detention in France and in Armenia” Yerevan, Armenia(C.

If you have ever offered to help Herb with his citizenship filing fees, or wondered why this U.S. Marine Veteran is not a naturalized citizen, and wished you could help make that happen, now is the time to do it.  Unfortunately it is not as simple for Herb as filling out the application and sending it in, and he has to retain an immigration specialist to ensure his smooth acceptance as a U.S. Citizen.  This is currently in the works, so funds are needed as of beginning this campaign (July, 2019), and this page will be updated regularly with progress. All funds received will go directly to practical expenses associated with attaining citizenship such as application fees, document retrieval, background checks, professional fees, and visa renewal fees (if needed). 

If you need not know more, please support his citizenship efforts below.  From our hearts to yours, we bow deeply in Gratitude. 

If you would like to learn more about Herbe and his life, following is somewhat of an outline ...____

Herb moved to Southern California from his homeland on the Isle of Carmen, Campeche, in the Yucatan peninsula (Gulf of Mexico) with his mother and sister in 1990.   After serving in the Marine Corps. for 5 years, he began to explore a different path of service and self-healing, studying sustainable agriculture, irrigation, community gardens, nutrition, fitness, massage, and other holistic therapies. 

He volunteered extensively throughout San Diego County in a variety of areas of need; for example, to implement gardens in schools and other community areas; in equine therapy for victims of domestic violence; installing solar panels for low-income families; and guiding youth in Tai Chi and meditation practices.  He has also volunteered on permaculture projects in the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. 

These days, he is a regular installation at his local monastery's Day of Mindfulness, and can be found on the meditation cushion, during mindfulness walk, or having lunch contemplatively with the lay and ordained Sangha, the latter of which he affectionately refers to as ""Dharma Jedi's."" 

Herb volunteers with and serves as a board member for Veteran's for Peace, and is working to increase membership diversity for the San Diego chapter. 

He also volunteers and serves on the board of the Peace Resource Center in San Diego.  Due to Herb's efforts, the PRC recently pledged to ""go vegan"" at all of their events.  

In line with his passions for animal rights advocacy and the geopolitical sphere, Herb serves as the Vice President of the Vegan Democrats of North County San Diego Vegans.  He participates widely in protests and marches throughout the county. 

Of course, no description of Herb's life would be complete if it did not include Gaia, his tiny Chihuahua companion of 12 years. Though she weighs in at a mere 3 lbs., she has a huge personality needed to guide Herb on his path.

I feel profoundly lucky that I was able to attend and it is truly one of the best things I’ve experienced to date. While there, I represented Silicon Valley DSA on a panel for the Green New Deal at the CYD Environmental Caucus, and was elected to be the Bay Area regional director for that caucus soon after that!I was able to meet Bernie freakin' Sanders and listen to him and many other presidential candidates speak! I was also able to network, which has already helped my life and career in immeasurable ways. Since then, I have been quite busy- I was asked to be the deputy regional director for the California Young Dems, have been elected to be the chair of the environmental committee of SVYD, and have even helped work on local campaigns. This is truly my passion and I see myself doing this for a long time (or until we save the planet - whichever comes first!). I have the unique opportunity to represent my community as an Eco-Socialist and also a Young Dem, and I'm extremely honored to be given that chance. This season’s CADEM will be even more special, as I will be able to cast a vote (as a proxy) on who the California Democrats should endorse for President (!) and get to learn so much more about the Democratic party. However, the CADEM convention in May was in SF and so it was a lot easier for me to pay for the expenses associated with that trip. This time around, it's going to be a little tougher to pull off because it will be in Long Beach. The only thing standing between this myself and this incredible experience is cost.So here's the catch! I need help with the costs. Could you help me with that?$1, $5 or even $20! It may not seem like a lot but any little bit helps! I will need to pay for room & board, gas & parking (or a flight & then taxis!), food for 3 days, plus any expenses or fees that may come up while I’m there! Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and considering to help support me to go the CADEM Convention!

This is the democratic revolution we have been waiting for and as I continue to campaign for him in California and all over the globe, I hope you will too and stand with me as we work together in true party unity! Thank you very much!!!FEEL THE BERN!!!"

But, now I need help.If you can muster up the goodness in your heart and a few extra dollars, please help me.

I’m in desperate need of root canals, crowns and implants as a result of my stalker. I have already had infections in my teeth twice. And insurance won’t pay for any of this.The uncorrected dental problem specifically affects one of my health issues, Trigeminal Neuralgia, in which an artery is pressing against a nerve in the base of my skull sending stabbing pain through the upper and lower jaw on both sides of my mouth and into my ear.To make matters worse, I was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This year, I was finally diagnosed with reactivated Epstein Barr Virus and Cytomegalovirus, along with Hypogammaglobulinemia (CVID), a rare immune deficiency, requiring weekly blood product infusions for the rest of my life. Many of my medications and supplemental treatments are also not covered by insurance.What I am going through I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.

He is double majoring, right now, aiming for a Bachelor of Arts in Art History and International Human Rights. After Marcel completes his journey at Webster, his goal is to continue onto law school to work in the field of immigration law. The problem is: Marcel may not even be able to continue onto his second semester, here at Webster. Marcel is not from the Saint Louis area and doesn't have any family members around. Because of this, he doesn't have the ability to limit many expenses by commuting and has to rely on Webster's Campus Housing. Marcel grew up in Southern Missouri, a transgender child struggling with mental health issues, living in poverty. He lived with his disabled mother, who couldn't get approved for government disability aid and was unable to hold down a job.  Growing up, and continuing into his young adult life, he dealt with many different addicted, absuive, disabled, and neglectful parental figures - leading to difficult and strained relationships with them all. Even if any of them had the ability to help Marcel in his journey to attend college, they wouldn't have bothered. Even with the help of the FAFSA/Government Aid, the income from his on-campus job, and Webster's Scholarships and Financial Assistance (from getting a 3.83 GPA in high school and a 30 on the ACT) - Marcel is still at risk of not being able to attend Webster next semester. On top of the expenses of attending university, Marcel has to pay nearly $50 a month for medical perscriptions, as well as extra expenses relating to his gender transition. Marcel loves being at Webster. He made a great and supportive group of friends that he feels may follow him throughout his life. The childhood he grew up in conditioned him to think that he'd never come across that kind of unconditional love and support, but now he feels he has finally found it. The last thing he needs is for that to be ripped away from him. Even as a first generation college student, he is determined to give his best efforts in it all. Marcel is heavily involved in campus activities, on top of working and taking classes, including: The Residential Housing Association (RHA), Literature Club, History Politics and International Relations (HPIR), The Philosophy Coalition, Webster Democrats, and Webster's LGBT+ Alliance. Despite being a freshman, he is serving in several leadership positions in these groups. He is the Secretary of HPIR, the Chairman of the Advocacy Committee in RHA, and the Vice President of the LGBT+ Alliance. Despite facing several hardships throughout his childhood, and his high school career, he fought hard and earned himself a place at a fantastic, private university. After all that fighting, Marcel is at risk of losing his chance to attend Webster just after the first semester.  When people say attending college is a privilege, they're right. But the problem with that is: not everyone who earned and deserves that privilege is able to. Marcel earned that privilege after years of hard work. His one dream he had as a kid was to grow up, move out, and get to college. He wanted to be the first in his family to make a difference.Please help US help MARCEL achieve his dream. Every penny and every share/reblog counts! Thank you."

She didn't know every detail of his position on every issue, but she knew him to be a man of integrity, and a man who was not afraid to speak truth to power. The more she learned about him, the deeper and deeper her commitment grew.She is a forty-seven year old, mother of four boys and because of Bernie's presidential run, has finally joined a political party for the first time in her life.Prior to Bernie's run, she voted as an Independent, mostly aligning herself with the Democrats. Her parents are Democrats, and it would have been natural for her to register as a Democrat, but she could never bring herself to do so until Bernie Sanders declared his candidacy as a Democrat.To her, it has always felt as if the Democrats were slowly but surely giving their voices over to the corporations, and conceding their power to the forces on the right, to the war industry, and to corporate interests. Without Bernie's candidacy and his advocacy for a real change and a democracy that is ""for the people, by the people and of the people"" she felt she could not distinguish the differences between the Democrats and the Republicans, and she was wary of what looked like a system that was not really running in the interests of the people but was instead, running primarily for the best interests of profit for industry and power for a small group of elite.With Bernie Sanders, she believes American citizens have a chance to put a person of integrity in the White House who understands the real frustrations of a country governed by special interest groups, the war industry, big money, and the buddy system.Emilie will fight for Bernie's nomination at the National Convention as hard as she has fought for his nomination here in Colorado. She has been a ""boots on the ground"" volunteer since day one, engaged in everything from canvassing to event planning, to marches.She was elected as a National Credentials Committee member and is working hard to learn her role in this job. She was on the Colorado State Credentials Committee and also the Jefferson County Credentials Committee.Emilie is a paralegal, a painter, and a writer.

A civic leader, he promoted the City of St. Louis and served on several civic boards. He was a leader in making the St. Louis Bicentennial celebration in 1964 a huge success, and was the author of a history, “St. Louis: A Fond Look Back” that year. Around the same time, he co-wrote the book for the musical, “Molly Darling,” the only locally written musical ever staged at The Muny. He was a supporter and frequent visitor to the old Gaslight Square, and he wrote the book for another musical, “The Raspberry Queen,” which was staged at the old Crystal Palace cabaret. An avid softball player, Quig created several teams in the area. A locally produced documentary on his life is under way, sponsored by the Press Club of Metropolitan St. Louis. He was a co-founder and the organization’s first president in 1954. The script is complete and will be narrated by the popular Ron Elz, of KMOX radio and Johnny Rabbitt fame, and directed by the talented St. Louis-based filmmaker Eric Butler. The film is being produced by Quig’s daughter, Catherine (Katy) Gurley, a local journalist and former St. Louis Globe-Democrat reporter, who wrote the script. No one is being paid for working on this film. It is a true labor of love for a man who gave much to the St. Louis he cherished and grew up in. The Press Club helped fund the film initially, but Ms. Gurley is seeking $3,500 more to pay for copyright permissions for jazz music to be woven through the film. Quig was a jazz lover and historian, and authentic music will be an integral part of the film. Contributors of any amount will be listed in a poster about the film at its opening in September and will be invited to attend the opening night and reception free of charge. Contributors of $50 or more will receive a DVD of the film. If you’re a long-time St. Louisan, Quig touched your life in ways you might not realize with his many contributions to all things civic in St. Louis between the 1950s to the 1980s.

She plans to do consulting to get started. We all know she has talents and skills that will land her a job fast, but it could take some time. She is taking this risk because she knows that leaving for Portland is what she needs to do to take care of herself.

$2,415 raised of $4,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/julia039s-education-fund,"Spanish Fort, AL",Julia's Education Fund,"Created May 8, 2018","*From friends of Julia: this is an amazing young woman with a bright future ahead of her. Funds raised through this effort will go towards her college books and other expenses associated with attending Barnard College.My name is Julia Coccaro and I am a senior at Spanish Fort High School located in a suburb of Mobile, Alabama. I have been heavily involved in political activism for the duration of my high school career. My sophomore year, I founded a chapter of High School Democrats of America on my campus and served as South Regional Director for the state organization. My junior year, I moved up in rank to Vice Chairwoman of ALHSD and simultaneously served as Editor-in-Chief of The Progressive Teen, the national publication of HSDA. This past summer, I worked as the PR Director for Jason Fisher, a former U.S. Senate candidate from Alabama. This year, I currently serve as Chairwoman of ALHSD and am volunteering for three state legislature campaigns as well as Walt Maddox’s gubernatorial campaign.I have also gained quite a bit of publicity for my outspokenness regarding a controversial summer reading list for my AP Government class at SFHS. The list, which I received in June, contained titles such as Liberalism is a Mental Disorder, Climate of Corruption: Politics & Power Behind the Global Warming Hoax, and 48 Liberal Lies About American History. The thirty books on the list, which I proved to be in use for several years, blatantly conveyed radical conservative bias. I posted the assignment on my Facebook page; within a matter of hours, it had acquired millions of views and the list itself was retracted by our Superintendent. Two days later, my post reached over 200 national news outlets. Because of the immense attention the list garnered in such a short period of time, I decided to strike while the iron was hot. The list was not the only circumstance in which I had noticed bias within the classroom.In my sophomore year, my Driver's Education teacher spent multiple class periods preaching his political beliefs and Christian faith, preventing us from completing our classwork. That same year, I founded a chapter of High School Democrats of America on my campus. At one of our meetings, I suggested that the club members travel to Montgomery to lobby our legislators for comprehensive sex education. I was then told by my school's administration that our club was no longer allowed to discuss LGBTQ-related issues. Finally, in my junior year, I oversaw the ""Self-Expression"" page of the yearbook, and a student I had asked to be featured on the page wanted to include the phrase ""coming out"" in her quote. Our yearbook advisor and assistant principal made it clear that they would not allow that phrase in the yearbook. After a long and heated discussion with our principal in which he stated his concerns about controversy and bullying, I was required to alter the quote and remove the ""controversial"" phrase. These issues, together with the list, were evidence of a culture of bias and discrimination at my high school. As a result, I decided to draft a formal complaint with the school system.For two weeks, I skimmed through the Board of Education's policy manual and found where each incident described violated a specific policy. I cross-referenced the occurrences with the violated policies or Constitutional rights. Additionally, I included a list of remedies in which I requested for the Board of Education to enforce its policies and to provide objectivity, inclusivity, and tolerance training for all teachers within our public school system. The final pages of the complaint were composed of signatures from both students and parents that supported the cause. An acquaintance with legal background proofread the complaint and it was delivered by certified mail to my Superintendent on July 10th.Following the delivery of the complaint, I interviewed with several news outlets and brought my concerns to local representatives, such as my District 1 Congressman Bradley Byrne, as well as individual members of the school board.The national media attention the complaint received exposed the use of extremely racist, sexist, and overall inaccurate PowerPoint slides by the same AP Government teacher who created the reading list; however, despite the unveiling of this curriculum, neither my school’s administration nor the Baldwin County Board of Education have taken hardly any measures to correct the conservative agenda that is being taught in that class. The backlash that I have received from my candor has undoubtedly made my senior year extremely difficult.Next year, I will be attending Barnard College, the women’s college affiliated with Columbia University. My decision to attend Barnard was not an easy one; while I was more than willing to go into debt for such an amazing education, I did not anticipate the lack of financial aid I ultimately received from the institution. However, I watched as almost every single one of my friends were mailed rejection letters from their dream schools despite being more than qualified for acceptance. Had I planned on majoring in a STEM field, I would’ve immediately chosen a much less expensive state school that offered me a scholarship; however, because I plan on working in politics, the location and name recognition of the school and thus the connections I make will ultimately be more pertinent for my career. My gut feeling told me that this was an opportunity I had to take and I feel incredibly content with my decision.  "

Cyllah Memorial Fund,"Created June 22, 2017","In loving memory of Almami Cyllah, we his friends would like to recognize the impact this great man had on many of our lives by raising funds for a memorial in his name. We are currently researching options, such as a scholarship or internship fund and/or a charity donation to a cause that Almami would have championed. Once funds have been raised, we will decide democratically among all contributors how to best put his memorial fund to use.  Please share this widely with friends and colleagues who also knew Almami or who would share his ideals. For those who did not have the opportunity to know him well, please see a bio below for a glimpse into his life.Almami Ibrahim Cyllah was born in Makeni, Sierra Leone on May 31, 1951 to parents, Mr. Sallu Cyllah and Haja Isata Nabie. As the only child born to Isata, Almami was a “gift from God” from the beginning of his life, and his kindness, generosity and love touched many lives.As a child, Almami attended St. Francis Secondary School and Bo School in Sierra Leone. He travelled to the USA to attend Catholic University in Washington, DC, and worked multiple jobs to pay for his education and provide for his young family. After graduation in 1980, he joined Amnesty International, where he served for more than a decade as a human rights defender, advocate and head of the Africa program. Many years spent speaking truth to power solidified within Almami the sense of justice, honesty and integrity, that all who knew him recognized in his convictions. His colleagues from Amnesty remember his mentorship and inspiration that he cultivated especially among the younger staff to prepare them for the time, energy and commitment required to protect human rights.In 1994, Almami was called back to Sierra Leone to serve as commissioner in the Interim National Electoral Commission, when the country was still at war. Preparing for the first elections in 30 years, stakes were high and deadly threats were made frequently, but this did not deter Almami’s commitment to his country. Even after being targeted and seriously injured in an attempt on his life, Almami continued to play a leading role in organizing Bintumani I and II, which decided the electoral future of Sierra Leone. Turning down the offer to join the administration that followed the elections, he returned instead to his work at Amnesty and his dedication to strengthening democracy.In 2000, Almami began work with the NDI overseeing programs in Haiti and later was part of NDI-Carter Center electoral observation missions across Africa. Meanwhile, Almami joined the IFES as Country Director, first in Haiti, then Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, where he directly supported efforts for free and fair elections. Almami became Africa Regional Director for IFES in 2008 and although he was based in Washington, DC, he travelled frequently to Africa to provide support to colleagues across the continent. Many who worked with Almami through these years remember his leadership, his sense of team (which to many felt like family) and his commitment to democracy in Africa.After his retirement in 2014, Almami began the exciting chapter of following one of his lifelong goals—to establish a political party and use his decades of experience in human rights and democracy to bring a new leadership perspective to his beloved Sierra Leone. Earlier this year, the National Progressive Democrats party was officially registered by the Sierra Leone Political Parties Registration Commission, an institution that Almami had been instrumental in establishing to bring greater transparency, honesty and accountability to the electoral process in Sierra Leone. Sadly, we lost Almami before he could fully participate as a future candidate for leadership in Sierra Leone.Almami leaves behind his family—his children and his grandchildren whom he cherished—and his friends who number across countries, continents and cultures. His is a legacy that we hope will live on within all of us."

My name is Ashley Rodriguez, I am an official Bernie National Delegate for Texas Senate District 29 in El Paso. I am fundraising for my trip to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July 25th to July 28th. The costs however are absolutely astronomical, it's clear the Democratic Party has become extremely disconnected from the class of people they claim to represent... I believe there should be more voices at the DNC representing lower and middle income people but by driving up the costs they are trying to make it impossible for that to happen. Nevertheless I am trying to do whatever it takes to make this opportunity happen to be able to represent the awesome, but most times, underheard people of my community. Let's take the oligarchy out of our democracy and bring back the voice of the people, not the voice of the rich and the powerful.In order to keep the costs as low as possible I sought out aid from an amazing organization I belong to, the Democratic Socialists of America, where DSA's Deputy Director, David Duhalde was a total badass and hooked me up with free housing in Philly. So the money raised through here will go towards my flight costs which are around $600, rideshare costs, metro card cost, food costs, and the numerous add-on charges the DNC is applying to most of their convention functions ($200 for ""breakfast bash"" where delgates need to be in order to receive their credentials). Any remaining funds will go towards helping fellow DSA members here in El Paso that will be attending the peaceful protests taking place at the DNC, with any of their travel costs. Since I was just elected for this spot at the Texas State Democratic Convention on June 18th it hasn't alloted for very much time for me to be able to fundraise, but anything you can do from now until July 22nd will help tremendously!    I have worked tirelessly for the Bernie Sanders campaign as a Super Volunteer and as a founder of a grassroots organization that I and other Bernie supporters started up about a year ago called West Texas Border for Bernie. Even as a broke college student I donated what I could when I could, to Bernie's campaign. He has inspired me to become the change that we have all been wishing to see in this world. As a latina, a first generation college student, a former working single mother of two, and as a wife/daughter/sister of veterans, Bernie's message deeply resonated with me and I fought and will continue to fight for the people's revolution that he has brought forth. I have continued this political revolution at home by running for, and being elected to, precinct chair for precinct 56 for the El Paso County Democratic Party, and by helping to bring a DSA chapter/organizing committee to El Paso, DSA - El Chuco del Norte. I am a member of YDS (Young Democratic Socialists) at the University of Texas at El Paso where I am currently attending studies for my undergraduate degree. That after a decade of being unable to afford college I am finally able to attend and am in my senior year of college with a 4.0 GPA, poised to graduate this December with a major in Political Science with a concentration in Law & Politics and a minor in History. I am a member of Pi Sigma Alpha Epsilon Epsilon chapter, the Political Science Honors Society. I am also the newly appointed Secretary for the El Paso Northeast Democrats, and the interim Secretary for the provisional El Paso Stonewall Democrats.  I hope to serve my community well and make them proud of me at this years DNC and to represent Bernie and the countless people that are supporting him and are depending on this revolution just as much as I am! WE CAN DO THIS!"

Two important DNC Committees are meeting in Puerto Rico in a few weeks - the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and the DNC Executive Committee.  What will happen at these ""public"" meetings?  The only way to know is to:A.  Attend the meeting yourself, ORB.  Make arrangements with the DNC to travel to Washington DC to read the transcripts of the meetings several months after the meetings occur, if you can get permission, and likely with a babysitter that the DNC assigns to you in their office, ORC. Watch it on my Facebook LIVESTREAM so that you and others can watch this public meeting in our pursuit for truth and transparency. I hope you help with Option C, otherwise, we may never know what decisions are made about our party. Why do we want to know what happens at these meetings? We just wrapped up two years of advocating for major reforms within the DNC, especially reforming superdelegates, and had huge success!  However, it is no secret that many of the DNC members fought the reforms, but felt pressure from grassroots Democrats across the country that were demanding transparency and fairness.  It is also not a secret that DNC members were told that the reforms weren't permanent and could be changed later.  I would hope that the DNC members would not reverse the reforms they just passed, but how will we know if we don't keep our eyes on them?  After the 2016 DNC Convention, I have been at every DNC meeting possible and began LIVESTREAMING to share what I was learning with others.  I've learned valuable information every time.  At first, I did this all on my own dime.  Then, one DNC member attacked me and accused me of being a Russian operative and working for Vladimir Putin with the intent to destroy the Democratic Party!  The grassroots was furious and many people stepped up and offered to help not only cover costs, but to watch and  share the LIVESTREAMS, which created even more transparency.I want to be clear that my intention is to make sure that grassroots Democrats know what is happening in OUR party. Republicans need to fix their dysfunctional party and Democrats need to fix ours.  I do not want the Democratic Party to fail. In fact, as long as we have a two-party system, I want the Democratic Party to succeed and thrive and work for the people they claim to care about.  Unfortunately, I don't trust that this will occur without us watching and advocating within the party.  If you can, and if you would like to support the DNC Watch Puerto Rico LIVESTREAM for the next DNC committee meetings,  you can make a donation here.   I will Facebook LIVESTREAM the DNC Rules and Bylaws and Executive Committee Meetings on my FB Page - https://www.facebook.com/selinavickerswv/  You can also find other LIVESTREAMS on that Facebook page by looking at the ""Events"".

Welcome to my fundraising page. 

My name is Christian Smith and I am running for Mobile County Treasurer. I am running as a Democrat and believe I represent the voice of the people. 

I am running as treasurer because I want to bring more transparency and better accountability to this office. 
I believe that I represent the choice of the people and think that I would be able to restore accountability to the position that people would like to see in their government. Here is my Platform, I hope you will take time to read it as well as go to my facebook page www.facebook.com/christiansmith2012  The treasurer adds a level of accountability and oversight to the budget. Some may argue it is a duplication of services provided by the finance office; however, the finance office is not accountable to the people. They are salaried employees of the county. It is also argued we are one of three counties to still maintain the office of treasurer, but what many don't realize is that the other counties have rolled the treasurer's duties into the Revenue Commissioner's office. This is not the intention of those seeking to eliminate this office. If they have their way, no elected official would be over the budget and there would be far less accountability.My objectives, if elected are to have the following 4 goals:1. Provide more transparencyI want to take the budget and break it down for a person who does not have background in budgeting to understand. I want to make it available to whoever wants to see it in a format that can be understood rather than generic categories such as maintenance or building fund. I want people to be able to see how their hard-earned money is working for them and to have concrete examples of it. The treasurer ensures a protective role to citizens of their money by being a gate keeper and making sure the money is spent on what it was allocated for.2. Make Wiser InvestmentsWith the economy currently how it is we cannot afford to rely on a department that is not accountable to the people to make sure the investments are representing all the citizens of Mobile County. It is my goal to task this duty back to the treasurer's office to benefit all the citizens of Mobile county instead of just certain part of the county. It is our money as citizens and it should benefit all of us and not just some. I want to make sure we maintain our current budget by making wise investments and not losing money by taking riskier ones.3. Modernize the Office.To allow the citizens the transparency of the budget on the expenditure and investments site I would like to modernize the office by providing a website directly dedicated to it. Currently it is one of the few offices that does not have its own website, which means if you would like to know any of the financial information about the county you need to go downtown and go through boxes and boxes of papers. Those papers are not broken down for you to really understand where the money is going. I want citizens to have the opportunity to go on the website and know who the treasurer is, what the treasurer does, and where their money is going. By allowing citizens this opportunity they are not only able to question the treasurer but all their local elected officials.4. Use it as a tool of Citizen EngagementBy allowing citizens the ability to review the budget online, they are able to understand what is going on with their money and are able to ask questions. Too often do citizens feel disconnected with their community or see the point in voting since they feel their voice doesn't matter. By having this information readily available citizens can voice their opinions and hold their elected official accountable.Mobile needs to move forward, and we cannot move forward if we do not know what is going on in our backyard.A vote for me is vote for moving Mobile forward."

Doing what families do, we compromised with $1000.00 per teammate.

$20,136 raised of $45,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/im-66-ill-no-money-for-food,"Westfield, NJ",I'm a a disabled USA Vet Intel Ofcr needs support!,"Created October 21, 2018","
I'm a Disabled US Veteran Intelligence Officer who served 34 years.  I am in serious need of financial help.

After I was injured in service in 2010, I suffered catastrophic illness while working, and discovered I was a 58 year old with a secret: I was born in the 1950s with fatal Cystic Fibrosis when not much was known. At birth the Doctors told Mom to just let me die in the Maternity Ward. Back then the MDs had  no real idea what the causes of ""CF"" was. In fact they had no idea I had CF. I went 58 years in the dark with symptoms I worked around. 

Ordinarily, babies died of what I had usually in hours to days.  It causes asphyxiating infections, Lung failure, convulsions, mucusization, and the inability to hydrate. My Mom simply refused to give up on me! She left the hospital and hand nursed me somehow to health at home with a local Doctor's help.  While I never regained perfect health she accomplished enough for me to enter kindergarten right on time.  But for so many years till now, I have been subject to sudden illness and  vulnerable. To life threatening  infections. Now, it's getting a a lot worse since I was injured on the job. 

.According to the 2017 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry Data, patients in the U.S. born between 2013 and 2017 can expect to possibly live to a maximum life span into their mid-40s. I am already 20 years past that wear date and I was born more than 60 years earlier!! I had no idea I even had a wear date! 

I was hired in my thirties by very high ranking Intelligence and Military personnel in 1986 to a very tough job in the Military Intelligence Community.  And I worked 24x7 heads down from 1985 to 2010. Then I was abruptly injured on the job and discovered that I had this secret illness normally long fatal by your 30th to 40th birthday, Cystic Fibrosis. And the injury, poisoning, had triggered it Into high gear!  I had had it all my life and many, many symptoms but I'd just ""worked around it"" and lived. It all came as a shock to me after I was wounded at my job, that we discovered I'd had full blown Cystic Fibrosis all my life.  Even the Doctors were shocked, some refused to believe it. One shook my hand and said I was the first person with Cystic Fibrosis he'd ever met over 35 who hadn't had a Lung Transplant. Altogether I concluded they were abusing me. There is so little medical experience with full blown Cystic and my age adults with it, since most of us die in childhood or early adulthood. I ran into huge problems getting care going through facilities who said they had Adult CF clinics but really didn't. I'm an anomaly I guess.  I always ate healthy, exercised and didn't let the constant congestion, breathing trouble, heart arrhythmia, and many other symptoms stop me.

I did my jobs as a computer scientist for 25 years before joining the Agency. I did my job for the Agency and under 5 Presidents (directly) for 34 years without stopping. yet I was harboring this illness which has now stripped me of my health by worsening  starting about six years ago. After my in service injury..The ever present Cystic Fibrosis and the constant overwhelming physical symptoms has created  enormous health expenses for me at this age, partially covered only by Medicare. I have very little disability money left each week for food or housing, yet must keep up my strength, I must keep going.  By the fifteenth of the month I""M BROKE. If I lose my home, I will consume the remaining disability money and then what? I somehow have to maintain this home. Food is not easy as bad yet cheap food is very bad for a CF patient. Days go by I eat only one or two  small and sometimes one moderate meal, the lowest cost I can find. I often go to bed literally starving!I had a stroke a while back from it all, my heart fibrillated and threw a clot, from my job injury: poisoning,  which aside from rendering me into a state of working in constant physical distress, also took a lot of my vision to a vision cut and retinopathy macular edema (Retinal Swelling). It took what was left of my vision, after I lost 1/4 of it to blindness, and turned it into a ""fun house mirror"" image. So I've had 125 surgical injections into each of my eyes, 6-8 weeks apart, or more, just to try and maintain legal non-blindness enough, reducing my 20:85 down to 20:25 in both eyes (thank God, I exercised my eyes daily with a vision machine for 4 years and took injections since 2013!! Thank you Doctor(s)).  I have to be able to travel, drive and see well enough to take care of myself. And so I soldier on. I am fighting to stay alive as long as God gives me.   I thank God for every day I wake up, even feeling terrible. But the 0 balance in my checking account really is costing me.On top of it all because I can not afford the overhead alone, I am now forced to make this appeal for support trying to keep from becoming homeless.  There is no State Tax Exemption for individuals such as me who do not retire under a DD-214 as regular soldiers do. If they are disabled, they are property tax exempt. Me, no relief, though I worked 33+ years and had the same exposure to combat and worse from foreign intel and terror groups the rest of the time.Every day I see people raising money for political causes. Lots of money. I feel for everyone like me who needs moderate amounts but without which they will, like me, be rendered homeless.  We aren't going to stand out with all the Election Year fund raising of immediate need. And this year everyone has their money well invested.  I have none.I recently completed being treated surgically for my kidneys which abruptly started malfunctioning. One day I was driving home from lunch and I felt a twinge of pain in my right hip region. By the time I got suspicious and went to the Doctor, I must have looked like death once warmed over. He ordered me to the Hospital. The surgery lasted from October 2018 to January 2019, repeatedly. Oh such pain you would not wish on your worst enemy. They had to stick lasers and microscopes and lights up, well, you know where. And it scratched and cut me all up! It was harrowing and at one time I suffered a near heart attack from the pain while on the surgery table. I've lost a fair amount of my stamina from that experience and and am facing other ""consequences"".Hence I am forced to raise money so as to keep my home hoping for the good will of others' generosity. I hope my attention to detail isn't grossing you out. But I am very desperate and have no idea how to do this.Well, enough griping. You get the picture.  My life is not easy. If I lose my home, what then?  Life on the streets would be death. Family aren't available to take me in. And they are democrats.   It's a constant battle for me. Yet even my girlfriend says she's sick of hearing about it. So in spite of her ability to help, she is no longer willing to. Such is the tragic consequence of illness - it doesn't go away to suit others and it is always there impeding your ability to survive. Well,  keeping silent won't help me. And, perhaps, EX girlfriend.  When my partner is sick, no matter how difficult, no matter how repetitive, no matter how difficult to listen to, I'M THERE.

Any support would be a wonderful gift to me. I would be most grateful for help coping with this tragedy. My heart is in trouble, I've become partly blind and deaf.  I have CF related diabetes. I have breathing trouble. I have digestion problems.  I have to fight it. And my lungs and pancreas could kill me if they become infected, all in under 72 hours. I need to keep ridiculously expensive medications going. One pill I take twice a day for CF costs over $25,000 each month. The eye injections are $4800 each.  I do hope to get the house under control. It would be a blessing from God. For the rest I've assembled insurance and Health Grants.  I wish they had Health Grants for every day expenses.

I have to choose between medications and eating.  Health Care and having a roof over my head.  The part of the Military I work for apparently has no care systems or support for long term veterans at all. So as long as I am injured they can ignore me, it appears. Please consider making a modest donation to me, as 2019 is the year if I can not find support, I become a fatally afflicted homeless Intel Veteran. I really do  need your help. That's my fighting pose in the photo. Me refusing to go down or if I do,  refusing to stay down. Just call me ""Rocky""!! Please let me know if you believe in me, by Donating. Gratefully, Dr. Jack

The total cost of the trip is $3500, which includes air fare and hotel accomodations. The purpose is to lobby Sacramento Region U.S. representatives (5 Democrats and 3 Republicans), Congressional committees, and federal agencies to consider climate risks as a threat to our regional and national health and prosperity. Why sponsor me? Most people attending have their company sponsor them, so they can network with those who influence policy locally and nationally. As an individual looking to make a change, I am without a corporate sponsor, but I believe my voice for the climate at this event is essential.  CCL chapters raise all their own operating funds, because the national organization does not have chapter fundraising capacity.  So I am asking you to be my sponsor! Because of the fuzzy the line between 501c3 and 501c4 activities on this trip, these donations are not tax-deductible. This makes it even harder to raise funds for this trip.Trip purpose:To maximize the outcome of this trip for the climate, I am currently working to include a climate risk position paper for our Air Quality Team lobbying meetings. I will also have the chance to discuss the climate issue with over 200 community leaders in the business, non-profit, academic, and governmental sectors. There are no other voices directly addressing climate risk in this influential business and community organization. This is a continuation of the work I began on the same trip last year and an expression of my ongoing climate commitment. This trip is part of a larger effort by members of Citizens' Climate Lobby to have a national conversation on climate solutions, as we build the political will to overcome past and current barriers to action.Funds needed by:The deadline for trip payment is February 6, but if I know that friends and family are willing to help, I will proceed with the payment and I would be happy to receive your help anytime up to the start of the trip on April 14.What the support means to me: I paid for this trip last year, but I am unable to make the entire expenditure this time around.  Your support means that I am not alone in this journey to expand the climate conversation in circles of power and influence here in the Capitol Region and in Washington D.C. It means that you have confidence in my ability to represent the issue intelligently in this arena, and that you agree with me that this project in particular is worth the cost. How I will show my gratitude:I will keep you all updated on progress towards the inclusion of a climate risk position in the Air Quality Team policy papers that we will be taking to D.C. I will also be preparing some language for inclusion in other team papers, including the Food and Ag, Economic Development, and Transportation teams and will keep you updated on those. And of course, I will post during and after my trip, reporting back on the meetings and connections I have made."

As a very active person, I’m climbing to demonstrate that giving up a  kidney won’t hold me back from tackling the tallest mountain in the world.  I donated in January 2017, and returned to endurance sports and mountaineering just a few months later and will be on Everest 2.5 years later.  And if I can do that, perhaps somebody out there may make a decision to get tested for a donation, ultimately elect to be a living donor, and have a chance to save a life.I’ve linked up with the non-profits American 300 and Purple Heart Summits.  They link up experienced mountaineers with service members wounded in action, sharing the skills needed to climb the world’s tallest mountains. There are several climbs in the next 18 months in their program, including Everest in 2020.  So I’ll be doing several climbs with some of our wounded warriors as a climbing mentor to those heros.  Finally, you can follow my progress towards Everest and learn more about the kidney donation on my FaceBook page, Instagram, Twitter, and my personal homepage.  Even a hash tag:  #AdventureKidneyThanks for your consideration in support of this mission.  Cheers!~Dave “Dash” AshleySome people have asked...what kind of climbing/training have I done so far?  Below are some of the biggest and most recent:-Mulitple Pike’s Peak climbs, on foot, mountain bike (downhill was amazing!) and winter snowshoe climb (solo, in the dark, and in a snowstorm!) 1999-2015- Multiple other 14ers in Colorado 1999-2015- 1st Mount Rainier summit, ice ax/crampons/rope team (guided by David Adlard) 2014- Mount Adams, ice ax, crampons, (guided by David Adlard and took my family!) 2015- Highlands Sky 40 Mile Ultramarathon, Canaan Valley WV, June 2017 just 4 months following kidney donation!- 1st Mount Whitney summit (tallest mountain in contiguous US at 14,500+ feet), October 2017- 1st Mount Wlison double summit ultramarathon (10k climbing, 28 miles) Dec 2017- Mount Russell, ice axe, crampons (14,000+ feet) Spring 2018- Mount Iron to Mount Baldy (the “traverse”), bike back to Iron trailhead, 40 miles, 11k elevation gain, Nov 2018- 2nd Mount Wilson double ultramarathon (10k climbing, 28 miles) Dec 2018- Death Valley 3-day peak bagging trip (4 peaks in 3 days 80% off trail) Jan 2019- Colorado quad-14er snowshoe ascent:  Mt Democrat, Lincoln, Cameron, and Bross, March 2019 - 2nd Mount Wilson summit, May 2019- Cactus to Clouds round trip summit/descent in one day, Palms Springs valley to top of Mount San Jacinto, over 10,800 feet of gain/loss over 41 miles"

Democrat, republican, or moderate, doesn't matter as long as its not someone who votes for an extreme anti-abortion bill.

No matter what race they run, no matter what office they run for. We will run against them and support an opposing candidate. Until the candidate submits a letter of apology addressed to all women, they will have no career in politics.

Hi everyone, my name is Miguel ""Alex"" Antonio. I am a member of the Revolution Club in Los Angeles and a follower of Bob Avakian. I'm one of the defendants in the #Freeway9 case. I'm also part of the National Get Organized For An Actual Revolution Tour.

The National Revolution Tour is currently in Chicago, on a mission to bring forward masses of people into the ranks of the movement for an actual revolution. They are putting to people the need to get rid of this system, a system that sends their police to murder black and brown people in the thousands every year, that conditions black and brown youth in the neighborhoods to fight and kill eachother, that conditions men to view and treat women as less than human, a system that is destroying the planet. A system that has enabled a white supremacist fascist to take the reigns of this murderous system and aims to make things alot worse for humanity. Because of all this, it's very important and crucial that this National Tour is going around the country putting the strategy we have and most importantly, the leadership we have in Bob Avakian on the map, and that there is a better way the world can be, but it's going to take a revolution to overthrow this system at the soonest possible time. 


I was recently on trial for protesting the Trump/Pence Fascist Regime. Myself and 7 other very courageous people took to the 101 freeway in two seperate occasions during morning rush hour in Downtown LA in the fall of 2017, to sound the alarm against fascism. Calling on millions to pour into the streets in non-violent, sustained political resistance to demand: In the name of humanity, we REFUSE to accept a fascist America! The Trump/Pence Regime Must Go! 

After the first freeway action the LAPD's Major Crimes Division sent in a spy to record entire meetings and conversations (including a conversation with me) at a church! 
The liberal democrat LA city attorney Mike Feuer has been working overtime to supress this information and make these cases about just 'blocking traffic on the freeway'. But these cases go much deeper than that. The city attorney and the LAPD have targeted members of Refuse Fascism and the Revolution Club with the aim of silencing and criminalizing protests that steps out of the bounds of meaningless protest as usual, that act commensurate to driving out the Trump/Pence Fascist Regime.


What does it tell you about this system and their representatives, that they would much rather have fascism consolidate, and send their police to spy on and criminalize people who are putting something on the line to stop this fascism, than calling on people to take to the streets to protest the crimes of the fascist regime? What are they afraid of? 


The trial ended in a hung jury after members of the jury refused to convict my co-defendant and I. The prosecutor immediately moved to reset the case and do a retrial. Because of this legal case, I have not been able to work and I'm very low on funds.


It is very important for me to be able to get to Chicago and connect with the National Tour and be part of organizing people to make revolution at the soonest possible time. 

I am dedicating my life to this. To throw-in all I can to contribute to this process of making Revolution and emancipating humanity. 

So I'm calling on you to contribute to getting me to Chicago this August, to do just that, to contribute to the mission of this National Tour. 

Dig into your wallets and make generous donations. Your contributions will go to buying plane tickets and other logistics. 
Every donation, big or small is very much appreciated! This is all for the emancipation of all humanity. 

Thank you!   
Warm regards, 

Alex"

My father died four years later from Osteosarcoma, a cancer that developed consequentially from a rare, hereditary bone disease in my family, Hardcastle syndrome. My mother, absent from my life, continues to struggle with her addictions.  I was recently kicked out of my grandparents house when i turned 18 and am financially independent. I worked on a Democratic congressional campaign this summer. Through phone calls and door knocking I connected with people of all walks of life, and listening to their problems gave me a better perspective as to what I can do with my future to better the lives of my neighbors.

We know each other. We help each other. There is an interesting mix of all walks of life – an area where the trash man sits on a porch with a lawyer or doctor listening while a carpenter plays blues guitar. It is an area where Republicans respect Democrats and vice-versa. Maybe it is that simple; we respect one another. We want people to feel safe down here. We want artists and musicians to flourish. We want people to come here to express themselves. We want this to be an area of town that has not been forgotten.”   Kerry’s Hope was formed to honor the memory of Kerry Postlewaite and his efforts to revitalize Haynie’s Corner Art’s District. Kerry was a kindhearted generous man who believed in and fought for the neighborhood long before it was labeled trendy in 2014.                                                          OUR CORE VALUES                                                          RESPECT                                                          COMPASSION                                                          DIGNITY                                                           INCLUSIVENESS                                                          SUSTAINABILITY                                                                        Kerry and his dad, Gary Postlewaite of Owensboro, KY renovated two homes in the neighborhood, 20 Washington Avenue and 30 E Blackford Avenue.

The people who lived in the neighborhood and raised their families there long before it became the popular destination spot that it has become. He respected those people and wanted them to feel included and safe from displacement.The goal in forming “Kerry’s Hope” is to provide resources to low income homeowners living in the HCAD neighborhood who are eager but struggling to maintain their homes.The focus is on empowering neighbors to become active participants in strengthening this historic, diverse and amazing area of Evansville, IN.The proceeds from Kerry’s Hope will be used to help low income homeowners in the neighborhood to improve and perform necessary maintenance on their homes.Contact Jill Hall to donate or volunteer.jillhallrealtor@gmail.com            812-305-4170"

I'm raising money for Origins FTD Foundation Inc., a public charity and any donation will help make impact. Thanks in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.Our Health & Wellbeing is at stake….The First 1000 DaysWe are all abundantly aware of the healthcare cost crisis at hand:  $3.5 trillion healthcare economy and everyone screaming about how to fund this out of control, ever-increasing healthcare trajectory. Democrats and Republicans are at each other’s throats in an unconscionable banter about the cost of health care, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and Medicaid/Medicare.From my point of view, as Americans, we complain loudly and often but seem to lose sight of how best to reverse/reform healthcare and its cost that are admittedly spiraling out of control.  I am a 76 year old grandfather and student of business and root cause analyzer.  I have an answer:  the answer is Prevention of diseaseas opposed to treating disease !!  Prevention and Wellness are birds of a feather.   Of course we all know that prevention is the best course don’t we ?  My answer resides in the Process of Prevention:  the  “how” “when” and “where” as individuals we take personal steps in the PREVENTION of disease ?  Or said another way:  How can we promote Wellness ?      I have an answer.   The prevention answer of how-when-where prevention, needs to include a paradigm shift for we citizens of the world. We need to assume personal responsibility for our own Prevention/Wellness.   OK, easy to say – but hard to do !!My personal Aha moment:  Unless we realize that where prevention and wellness are rooted is at the very source of life, we will not optimize success.  The source of our wellness occurs duringtheFirst 1000 Days – this most critical 1000 days occurs of our existence takes place between conception and baby’s age 2.   These 1000 days  are when the pregnant, soon-to-be-mom, and her family of origin, are most under the influence of the mom’s environment in utero, birth and post partum.  During this critical 1000 day period, the fetus is developing and receives a biologically programmedIMPRINT from the mom and baby’s cognitive development is 80% complete by age 2.   The biological imprint actually defines and provides what could be called a wellness algorithm that endures for the rest of the offspring’s life.     For both you and me, our wellness profile was predetermined, defined and hard-wired by the time we had reached the ripe old age of 2: First 1000 Days. Origins FTD Foundationhas created the world’s largest medical library on the subject of Maternal and Child Health.  This maternal and child health library has all of the answersa pregnant woman and her family and support group might have about reproduction, conception, gestation, birth, birth plans, breast feeding, parenting.   The wikiOriginsFTD™library is a treasure trove of information and real-time answers about “building a better baby” Want to join me in making a difference that impacts the next generation ? I'm raising money for Origins FTD Foundation Inc,and any donation will help to make the knowledge-base contained in the wikiOriginsFTD™medical library available and accessible to All Women Everywhere in their personal journey to the next generation’s programming of wellness. We can reform healthcare from the grass roots by the education of each other about the science known as Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD)…..epigenetics and biological programming.   We are in control of the process regarding the how-when-where of prevention and resulting wellness over one’s lifecourse.Thanks in advance for your contribution to this cause. My personal Aha or OMG:  Did you know: There are 4,000,000 live births each and every year in America.   50% are babies birthed to moms supported by Medicaid.   Think about the reason someone is on Medicaid from the point of view of nourishment and the biological imprint I spoke about earlier.How Origins FTD Foundation will deliver educational materialsOrigins FTDare creating a free mHealth App for women contemplating pregnancy or women who are already pregnant in an effort to augment the few visits she will have with her OB/Gyn, labor delivery nurse, midwife, pediatrician and medical professional.  Amazing how mobile smartphones can be a game changer.  Within 6 months following the successful completion of this charitable money raising, donor campaign, the AWEsome™ mHealth educational App will be available for test and feedback.    It has taken 8 years and $30MM to assemble this peer-reviewed maternal and child health knowledge-base that will now become stitched together in the form of an educational platform available through a free APP.We require $1,000,000 to birth the AWEsome™ mHealth knowledge-base to make it available to All Women Everywhere without cost.

My name is Sadhana Mandala and I am a junior at Wellesley High School, MA. I am the Vice-chair, director of local affairs of Wellesley High School Democrats. Our school chapter of the HSDA was formed this year and am extremely grateful for the opportunity it has presented to me.  I recently became a member of Massachusetts HSDA committee of finance and development. I have also started writing for “The progressive Teen” about issues that interest me like gun violence, criminal justice and social change. I was involved in canvassing and phone banking during the mid-term elections in Wellesley and neighboring towns. I learned so much from knocking on doors and talking to voters about the elections and pushing forward democratic ideals and candidates. It has been an amazing experience to meet the community of members in HSDA and form friendships with people who share similar ideals.I have been accepted to attend the HSDA Summit in Washington DC this summer. It is a great opportunity to meet fellow high school students from across the nation. This will be my first summit and I lack the funds to pay for it on my own. My parents have been paying for my ACT classes, music and art classes, and Model UN conferences which are extremely expensive. The cost of attendance is $500 and I would greatly appreciate any donation to help me attend the summit. I will be sure to bring back knowledge I have learned from summit in developing our school chapter of HSDA.Thank you for your support."

I am starting this Go Fund Me account for my baby sister Ashley. Like many fine Americans, she is currently swimming in student loan debt. She graduated college with one of those Master’s Degree things, and is currently paying back over $172,000 in student loans. I think it is slightly ridiculous that it cost so much for a degree, but it does. In addition to paying back that massive debt, she recently learned that she is pregnant with twins. ***Spoiler Alert*** She is having a boy and a girl. My four-year-old daughter Aly said her baby’s names will be “Frank and Rainbow,” but my sister and her boyfriend is still deciding on that.I recently saw a Go Fund Me created by a guy named Zack who was only seeking $10 to make potato salad, and ended up raising over $55,000. If Zack can raise over 55k for Potato Salad, surely, I can raise at least that much money for highly educated pregnant sister. I am currently on leave right now, so I could home back to NH and meet my sister’s boyfriend Lawrence. Surprisingly he is a pretty cool guy. He is absolutely terrible at Candle Pin bowling though. Last night we went bowling and out of the 30 balls he bowled he threw 22 gutter balls. He also came in last place when we played a family game of rummy last night. He does appear to be great at basketball though.Ashley and Lawrence are not asking for money, but I know they could use the help. Her and her boyfriend both have jobs with insurance, but we all live in the real world and know that money comes in slow and goes out fast especially with the cost of health care when you are pregnant with twins. She also just finished paying off a large medical expense from a freak accident where she ended up breaking her face. That story will be provided in a future update once the donations start rolling in.Though this fundraiser may sound like a joke, I assure you that it is a real fundraiser to help my sister reduce her student loan debt and help her with the absurd cost of the specialty medical visits she has to go to for her pregnancy. I understand everyone has bills, but the internet said that “crowdfunding” is a good way to reduce debt, so I am trying this out. The goal of this fundraiser is simple. Make it go viral to maximize donations. If you are unable to donate, please just share it and ask others to share it. Share it over and over until you start seeing at random times on your news feed. The more people that view it, the better the chances of raising money. I thought about making one of those “For just 10 cents a day” videos, showing my sister’s pregnant belly while she is making student loan payments and maybe have single tear rolling down her cheek while “Arms of an Angel” is playing in the background. That usually pulls at the heartstrings pretty good but there are probably some copyright laws I would have to learn before doing that, so I will just settle for this simple fundraiser.  I imagine if we can make this go viral, I can see us on the Ellen show explaining it how this idea came to be.Time to appeal to the different groups for donations:Democrats: It was her choice to keep the babies…Donate now!Republicans: She is keeping the babies…Donate now!West Coasters: She currently lives in California and likes the beach… Donate now!New Englanders: She still has the beloved New England accent and is moving back here soon… Donate now!Responsible people: She earned her Master’s Degree so that means she is “wicked smart” (said in a Boston accent) plus they’re both drug and alcohol free! … Donate now! This is not one of those “she got pregnant and now and looking for money” plans. This is one of those “Zack raised  over $55k for Potato Salad, so I am seeing if I can make life a little easier for my sister (who is not asking me to)” ideas.To all my brothers and sisters in the Navy, please help this post by sharing this fundraiser. Also, for just 10 cents a day, you could help the Levine family."

Every year in November, the Illinois State University chapter of College Democrats takes a trip out to Washington DC. The trip is intended to give students the opportunity to see Washington D.C., speak with crucial decision makers, and learn from important aids. As individuals who are deeply involved with the university and campus community, this trip takes learning outside of the classroom, and adds significantly to educational experience. This previous year the College Democrats that attended the trip were able to meet with Senator Dick Durbin, Bernie Sanders' Education Policy Advisor, and Chief Council for the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, just to name a few. There have been multiple students who have gone on this trip and have later received internships and jobs through the networking opportunities provided during the trip. Here are some costs that you would help cover:  - Gas reimbursements - Hotel and lodging- An additional expenses that might arise - Metro cards for students in attendance Any donation amount will be helpful and impactful for students and we greatly appreciate your help!

Even though hour selection can be chosen, individual hours cannot be purchased. We could, however, concentrate our BLIPS during rush hour certain time frames, where BLIP rates would be far more costly but would get a higher concentration of hourly BLIPS. 3. When you select your location, choose one with a webcam, so that you may later get an actual photo(s) of your ad, on-site.

That’s nice and I’m proud of it, but this time motivation is different, I want something a little more, substantial and meaningful than just a Gold Medal. I want a Victory for all people, all Colors, all Nations and specifically those still silent in the womb (the Unborn)! “Wrestling against infanticide is the primary objective of this World Tournament. Exposure, awareness and change is the whole purpose. This year the Veterans World Championships is in Tbilisi Georgia (old U.S.S.R.). My weight class is 100kg = 220lb, Div-E. I wrestle on 10/11/19 and will kneel during the medal ceremony/National Anthem in protest against abortion worldwide. Thank you!Daniel Boone Studenic ~ “WRESTLING for LIFE”(After reading be sure to check out the photos at the bottom of this page)MY PURPOSE…Reason to wrestle this year goes much deeper than a healthy competitive spirit. On June/26,  I saw a face book post diagramming a late term abortion procedure (9 months), where the infant was being torn apart with scissors and clamps inside the womb. Knowing what Dr Ben Carson said “the baby definitely feels the pain of this procedure”,,, frustrated; tears dripped from the corners of my eyes all day at work. That night, the Holy Spirit came to me in a lucid, enlightening dream with visions of how I would ""Wrestle for Life"" / Pro Life. I awoke (3am), saying “I’m in, I will do it Lord”, got up, walked into my office and began writing down details of my Illuminati vision... Accepting this mission has defined “PURPOSE” in me like never before. Reporters and photographers from over thirty countries show up at this annual event. Large scale international press, Media and Network News coverage (back in the states),  are known to give post tournament interviews and a National Public Radio Interview is already guaranteed. This is what I saw in my dream and word of my demonstration for the innocent will spread around the globe. Ambassadorial in your face antiabortion-awareness on a World Sports Stage! Aggressive ""word of mouth"" Friends, foe, referees, delegates, wrestlers, venue staff and fans etc, will further spread the good message back their home countries for even more cohesive support that will multiply exponentially!As a citizen of this complicated new world I deserve the same reciprocal measure of equality to ""peacefully demonstrate"" (after my Tournament is over),  on the World Stage of Sports like Kapernick (NFL), and Rapinoe (FIFA-Soccer), have done. Through major efforts and plenty of sweat equity, I too, have earned the right to demonstrate my ideals & views . If they can do it, then why can't I, especially to stop something like infanticide. Hopefully you will see my World Championship Sports demonstration on the evening news! This is  my ""shout from the mountain-top,"" freedom for unborn's moment that I'm using in Gods name. I will not desecrate American Servicemen, Flag or Anthem. I will salute them and the flag, as I take a knee. Be it Democrat or Republican the point here is to save the children and I praise both the political constituents from either side that is pro-life and acts on it through voting.My motivation to win is an expression of morality and ethics on behalf of Gods intentions.  Equality for all souls is the premise of my effort. I, Daniel, will be the Lion fighting for the Innocent Lambs on the day of this World Tournament. CLOSING...My quest is not about economics, immigration, political persuasion, etc. It’s about doing what is right! This is not a witch hunt or judgment, pointing fingers at mistakes some have made in their past. If in pain, give it to Jesus Christ and God Bless you.  it’s all about what Jesus said “Go and sin no more” and do no harm to the little ones; protect them.DEFEND LIFE.DEFEND TEAM.DEFEND COUNTRY.DEFEND HUMANITY.LEAVE NO UNBORN PERSON BEHIND!Gods words: “I knew you before you were born ~ God”.

Our country is under siege! Millions of illegals pour in through our southern border bringing crime, disease, death, and immortality! Like a majority of Americans we elected President Donald J Trump to Make America Great Again. President Trump’s main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he’s followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still. ""If the 63 million people who voted for Trump each pledge $80, we can build the wall.” That equates to roughly 5Billion Dollars, even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this!""Democrats are going to stall this project by every means possible and play political games to ensure President Trump doesn’t get his victor. They'd rather see President Trump fail, than see America succeed.  However, if we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jump start things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians. This won’t be easy, but it’s our duty as citizens. This needs to be shared every single day by each of you on social media. We can do it, and we can help President Trump make America safe again! As Reece Jones so eloquently states;""We live a world of borders and walls. In addition to the massive and expensive barrier on long stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border, in the 23 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, 26 other new walls and fences have gone up on political borders around the world. These walls are built by both totalitarian regimes and democracies, including India, Thailand, Israel, South Africa, and the European Union. Invariably, the barriers are justified in the language of security—the country must be protected from the terrorists, drug cartels, insurgents, or suicide bombers lurking on the other side.Despite the external focus of these justifications, in most instances these walls and fences are actually the result of the internal politics of the state that builds them. There are three specific reasons for constructing a border wall: establishing sovereignty over ungoverned or unruly lands; protecting the wealth of the state and population; and protecting cultural practices within the state from the possible influence of other value systems possessed by immigrants. The decision to build the 664-mile barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, although often presented as primarily in response to drug-related violence and terrorism, is largely due to these internal factors.The desire to establish clear sovereign authority over the state’s territory is the first factor that underlies the construction of a border barrier. Although we often imagine the territorial outline of countries as sharply drawn lines where the control of one state ends and another begins, most borders on the ground belie this simplicity. The idea that borders (or rivers or coastlines) are lines is a convenience of cartography that is established on the ground many years after a map is drawn, if at all. The oldest political borders in Europe, for example, are only a few hundred years old, and most were established more recently than that. Before the 1600s, most states did not recognize each other’s sovereign authority over a territory, and the technological advances in cartography that allowed fixed borders and territories to be represented had not been achieved. Consequently, even the simple idea that states have clearly defined territories that are marked by a linear border is a very recent development.The contemporary U.S.-Mexico border was established on maps at the end of the U.S.-Mexican War by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.1 The war settled which territories the expansion-minded United States could claim and transferred almost half of Mexico’s territory to the United- States. The last sections of the border were finalized with the Gadsden Purchase in 1854, which secured mining rights and a better route for a railroad connection to California. At the time, the territory was part of the United States in name only and, despite the enormous land area, was populated by about 100,000 Mexicans and 200,000 Native Americans.2 Over the intervening years, sovereign authority over these lands was established by moving Anglo populations onto the land and by violently suppressing any resistance. Land surveying, creating property maps, and the deployment of police forces resignified the landscape. Yet the line existed on the map and in the population’s geographic imagination only inchoately, as the practices and performances of sovereignty slowly inscribed the different territories onto the landscape.This process accelerated in the 1990s as funding for border security increased substantially and the idea of marking the imagined line with a physical barrier took hold. When the Border Patrol was established in 1924, it was tiny and remained underfunded for decades. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents at the U.S.-Mexico border, but by 2010 there were over 20,100.3 These changes have both practical and symbolic effects on the hardening of the border. The additional agents play a practical enforcement role while the fence project, which passed Congress in 2006, is much more symbolically significant. Walls and fences are the most efficient way to mark territorial differences on the ground because they take the abstract idea of a territory and materialize it. The construction of the barrier is another step in the process of reimaging these formerly Native American and Mexican lands as firmly part of the territory of the United States. By physically inscribing the line in the landscape, the wall brings the border into being and visually demonstrates where U.S. territory ends and Mexican territory begins.The second internal factor that results in the construction of a wall or fence on a border is the presence of a poorer country on the other side. In previous eras, political borders served primarily as either military defensive lines where one army prevented the movement of another or as markers of different government regimes where one set of laws and taxes or one cultural system stopped and another began. Over the 20th century, the practice of absolute sovereignty over a bounded territory produced substantial wealth inequalities globally, which increased the desire of many people to move either to avoid deteriorating conditions in their home state or to seek better economic opportunities elsewhere.4 These movements, along with the possibility of hostile people or items passing into the state, resulted in a much more substantial focus on borders as a location to prevent the unauthorized movement of people.Just as we often imagine most borders as the sharp lines depicted on maps, we also imagine that historically most borders were fenced and fortified, but this is not the case. The older purposes of borders as defensive military lines or administrative divisions do not necessitate a wall or fence. Fences do not deter tanks and airplanes, and administrative divisions between peaceful neighbors do not require an expensive barrier. The changing purpose for borders is evident in the sheer number of new barriers built in the past 20 years. Twenty-seven have been built since 1998, compared with 11 during the entire Cold War period from 1945 until 1990. Furthermore, several of those Cold War barriers were quite short including the U.S. fence with Cuba at Guantánamo Bay and the fence between Gibraltar and Spain.Not only are the new barriers longer than in the past, but many are built along peaceful borders. The significant characteristic that most of these borders share is that they mark a sharp wealth discontinuity.5 For example, the average annual per capita GDP (in 2010 U.S. dollars) of the countries that have built barriers since the fall of the Berlin Wall is $14,067; the average for the countries on the other side of these barriers is $2,801. The U.S. barrier on the Mexican border fits this pattern. Although the Canadian border is longer and certainly more porous (the Border Patrol estimated in 2009 that it had effective control over less than 1% of the Canadian border versus 35% of the Mexican border), the debates about fencing the border focused only on Mexico.6 The United States’ per capita GDP in 2010 was $47,000, Canada’s was $39,000, and Mexico’s was $14,000.

The final internal factor that plays a role in the decision to build a fence or wall on a political border is the fear that population movements will irreversibly change the way of life inside the state. In the United States, concerns about the threat that immigrant values pose are as old as the country itself. At different points in history, the Irish, the Chinese, and the Italians were all described as posing a grave threat to a particular version of what it meant to be an “American.” Today, these debates revolve around both Muslims and Latino immigrants who, anti-immigrant activists argue, bring alternative social codes and do not assimilate into the mainstream of U.S. society. The fence on the border symbolizes the hardened and fixed borderline that marks a clear distinction between the territories where particular people belong.The construction of a barrier on the border simultaneously legitimates and intensifies the internal exclusionary practices of the sovereign state. It legitimates exclusion by providing a material manifestation of the abstract idea of sovereignty, which brings the claim of territorial difference into being. The barrier also intensifies these exclusionary practices, because once the boundary is marked and “the container” of the state takes form, the perception of the difference between the two places becomes stronger. This process is evident in new restrictive immigration laws at the state level in Alabama and Arizona as well as in the protests and vandalism directed toward proposed Islamic cultural centers in New York and Tennessee. By demonstrating sovereign control, the state simultaneously reifies authority over that territory and defines the limits of the people that belong there. These perceived differences then fuel more passionate feelings of belonging to the in-group and distinction from the other on the outside.The U.S. fence on the Mexican border should be understood both in terms of the enhanced enforcement capabilities of the government and in the assertion of where the state has authority and who should be allowed in the state’s territory. The United States built the barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border to define its sovereign authority over its territory, to protect the economic privileges of its population, and to protect a particular way of life from other people who are perceived to have different value systems. Rather than a barrier against terrorism and cartel violence, it is a performance of the United States’ territory and boundaries.""To be clear, this project will fully erect and maintain a wall around whichever prison or mental institution the 45th president of the United States resides in once impeached, convicted, and sentenced, to protect the safety and security of real Americans like you and I.

I am saddened at the loss of our proud and resilient Sikh Afghans. I had the honor of interacting with some of them many times in the past.  We mourn their deaths as a nation and remind their loved ones that we are there for them.  I offer our heartfelt condolences to their families and friends as we grieve together.”The President asked fellow Afghans to extend a hand to those in need and assured the government will do everything to help to get through these hard times.Former President Hamid Karzai also condemned the blast and killing of Sikh Leader Avtar Singh in the blast and tweeted: “I learnt with great sadness about the death of Avtar Singh Khalsa, our dear compatriot and dynamic leader who lost his life in the terrorist attack in Jalalabad. He was a patriot Afghan who desired to represent our Sikh community in the next parliament. I mourn his loss and … extend my profound condolences to his family, friends and our Sikh community.”On Sunday July 15th, Hamdullah Mohib, PhD, the Ambassador of Afghanistan hosted a memorial service at the Washington, DC Embassy of Afghanistan to commemorate the Sikh and Hindu victims of the July 1 terrorist attack in Jalalabad.Opening the program, Ambassador Mohib said, “This occasion is one that brings us together to recognize a community that has deep roots in Afghanistan. For many, they often think of the minority Hindus and Sikhs as migrants from India. But in reality, the Hindus and Sikhs of Afghanistan are the original residents of this country.”Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees, as well as the first Hindu in the US Congress, also conveyed condolences, read by a representative of her office:“This brutal attack is yet another example of the fear, bigotry and hatred that sadly exists in our world. During the Taliban regime, Hindus and Sikhs were forced to wear yellow patches to identify themselves in public, furthering extreme prejudice, and eventually forcing many to seek asylum in India. These fear tactics and attacks attempt to divide us, but we cannot give into this hate. We must confront hatred with love, fear with understanding, and darkness with light. We must continue to stand up to bigotry and hatred in Afghanistan, here at home, and around the world.”The Hindu American Foundation publication Hindus in South Asia and the Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights, 2017 states“The plight of minorities and women was particularly concerning, as these vulnerable groups remained marginalized and subjected to violence, social prejudice and harassment. Hindus and Sikhs lack cremation rights and are often attacked and humiliated while trying to cremate their dead. Hindu and Sikh children are harassed and bullied in school for their religious beliefs. Parents are hesitant to send their daughters out alone due to fear that they may be kidnapped and forcefully married to a Muslim. Hindus and Sikhs have also faced employment discrimination and are both politically marginalized and excluded from most government jobs.”“Afghanistan’s constitution and legal system further institutionalize discrimination against non-Muslims and firmly establish Islam as the state religion. These conditions continue to lead Hindus and Sikhs to leave the country, with only an estimated 200 families remaining (down from over 200,000 Hindus/Sikhs in the 1970s), according to Afghan Hindu sources. Afghan Hindu and Sikh refugees similarly continue to face struggles in other countries where they have sought refuge, and in some instances, face deportation proceedings.”Many of the Sikh families of Afghanistan reside in Jalalabad.  Government officials promised a school for Sikh children would be provided but has not provided security to protect the children.  Despite the good words following the July 1st bombing, Sikh children are not able to attend the government school because of lack of security or secure transport between their homes and school. The lack of support for the education of a few Sikh children may be understandable.  There are millions of Afghan children without proper education or healthcare and the government has limited resources. Sikh families have been offered asylum and visas to immigrate to India and Canada.  Many have already left Afghanistan.  Those that remain are determined to stay in Afghanistan.  They are Afghans.  They love Afghanistan and want to live in Afghanistan.  They own land, homes, shops and businesses in Afghanistan.  The ashes of their ancestors are in Afghanistan.  The sons of Sikh families serve in the Afghan National Security Forces.   The children of Sikh families that decide to stay need a secure place to study.  Whether their families decide to remain or ultimately are forced to leave, the Sikh children will benefit from learning English and computer skills.In response to President Ghani’s request that others extend a hand to those in need, International Orphan Care and members of the Jalalabad Rotary Club have decided to undertake a program to provide educational resources, which Sikh children cannot receive at home.  On September 30, 2018, Essa Khan, the Director of International Orphan Care’s Mir Mohammad Youssof Vocational School in Jalalabad and Mr. Almas President of the Jalalabad Rotary Club met Mr. Ajeet Singh and Mr. Soorbir Singh both elders of Sikh community in Jalalabad.Essa Khan reported that “the purpose of their meeting was to pay attention to their minority country men while the government does not pay attention to them.  Sikhs do not even have standard education and school and are bullied and harmed by teachers and students at public schools.  Sikhs do not send their children to public schools though government has promised to build a school for them.” Essa Khan and Mr. Almas expressed condolences to the victims’ family and then they talked about how to help the victims’ family members and orphans’ education.Essa Khan and Mr. Almas discussed how to help the children of Sikhs that were martyred in the bombing and proposed that IOC might hold classes at the Sikh Gurdwara or temple. The Sikh elders requested an equipped computer lab and an English class to be held in the afternoon in a room at the Gurdwara for their orphans and children.On November 7th, Essa Khan and other members of the Jalalabad Rotary Club visited the Sikh community to meet the Sikh children, distribute school supplies and discuss the computer and English classes.There are 35 Sikh families in Jalalabad with 40 children that will attend the computer and English classes.The budget is $11,000.  The description of the equipment and services and the itemized costs are listed in the following table.  Computer and English Classes for Sikh Children in JalalabadEstimated Costs For First Year Description                             Cost           Unit      Number     Total Cost New Laptop Computers $ 300         Each          15               $   4,500Tables for Laptop                 $   40         Each          15               $       600Chairs                                         $   12         Each          30               $       360Electric Wiring                     $ 150  Lump Sum       1               $       150Miscellaneous Expense   $890    Lump Sum      1               $       890$Salary Two Teachers      $ 300       Month        12               $   3,600Internet Service                   $   75        Month        12               $      900Estimated Cost                                                                                     $11,000The funds are needed now to start the classes in 2019."

The state he serves already has one of the highest abortion rates in the country, but he has been continually fighting to make abortion even more widespread and commonplace in New York.  Last week he signed the “Reproductive Health Act,” effectively legalizing abortion through all nine months for any reason.In 2014, the abortion extremist publicly proclaimed on the Capitol Pressroom that pro-lifers are not welcome to live in New York. ""You have a schism within the Republican Party. … They’re searching to define their soul, that’s what’s going on. Is the Republican party in this state a moderate party or is it an extreme conservative party? That’s what they’re trying to figure out. It’s a mirror of what’s going on in Washington. The gridlock in Washington is less about Democrats and Republicans. It’s more about extreme Republicans versus moderate Republicans.""""… You’re seeing that play out in New York. … The Republican Party candidates are running against the SAFE Act — it was voted for by moderate Republicans who run the Senate! Their problem is not me and the Democrats; their problem is themselves. Who are they? Are they these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that’s who they are and they’re the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that’s not who New Yorkers are.""In 2013, Governor Cuomo made it clear that he wants New York to be the abortion capital of the world. New York’s abortion rate statewide is already almost twice as high as the national average, and in New York City, it’s even worse. Cuomo’s Women’s Equality Act, opposed by the majority of New Yorkers, was defeated last year, but Cuomo has sworn to try to get it passed again in 2014. This week, he signed the “Reproductive Health Act,” effectively legalizing abortion through all nine months for any reason.That Andrew Cuomo wants there to be more abortions in New York isn’t a surprise to anyone. That he is so extreme as to say that pro-lifers shouldn’t even be able to live in his state, simply for believing in the sanctity of life, is truly shocking. To him, evidently it’s not good enough for abortion to just be legal and widespread – he thinks that pro-lifers should be not only silenced, but kicked out of the state.It’s despicable and disturbing. And while pro-lifers are used to abortion advocates attempting to have them silenced, this takes it to an entirely new and sickening level.When women learn the truth about the development of their child and how the procedure will end their lives, they are more likely to choose life!The goal of New Life Ministries is to help end abortion by educating the culture to embrace the rights and dignity of every person.   We assist individual mothers, and families, and partner Churches to provide assistance to expectant mothers in crisis due to unplanned pregnancies.  We are an IRS approved 501(c)(3) charity."

$1,925 raised of $3,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/HelpChrisCarAteHisWallet,"West Hartford, CT","Help! Car Ate Wallet, Need New One","Created November 14, 2016","Hi Everyone! I'm Chris, most recently an organizer for Hillary Clinton in deep-red Butler County, Ohio, John Boehner's old district. I was in Ohio five months, from mid-June until mid-November, organizing for the Democratic team.Though we lost Ohio and the election, I believe we did good work in Ohio, including Butler. I worked hard, for long hours, buiding a Democratic volunteer base of over 100 during my five month stint. We registered around 600 voters, mostly Democrats (that wasn't easy in such conservative territory - we had to target carefully), and achieved a much better than average margin-vs-Republican here, relative to 2012, than did most counties. So we earned our keep.Anyhow, why am I here? Simply put, I had very tough luck with a car I bought in May, running into one difficulty after another with it. It was a 2002 Honda Civic which, due to limited resources, I bought as-is from a dealer in New Hampshire after my late father's old Toyota went kaput at the ripe old age of 240K miles. Rather than reliable transportation, the Civic turned into a very effective, slow-motion drainer of my wallet, always holding out hope that the next fix would be the last.The trouble started right away. From a radiator blow-out a week after purchase (overheating a tenth of a mile from my doctor's office after an appointment), then a head-gasket blowing on a hot SW Ohio day in July, bad news came slowly but steadily. Determined to scrap along through the campaign (a head gasket problem can often be limped along with for quite a while, it turns out), I then encountered a failed alternator, failed battery, failed computer, and, having replaced each of those in turn over the succeeding three months, a general electric failure. Had all this been evident from the start, I could've cut bait with the car and moved on. Instead, these problems all occurred in a steady drip. My reputable mechanics, who did yeoman's work trying to save the patient, did all they could to spare me expense where possible.  Total bill, over the five months from mid-May to mid-October, when I finally gave up? Right around $4000 (note, in haste, I mistakenly reported this is being around $5000 previously. My apologies - $4000 was bad enough!). Plenty to buy a fully functional used car backed by a warranty! The car ate the lion's share of my salary as a campaign organizer this summer and fall.So this brings me to you. Though it is embarrassing, the moreso in the wake of a tough election loss a week ago, I am asking you, my friends, to help me buy a decent used car so that I can get around back in Connecticut, my home to which I return this week in a rental car.By helping me buy a decent car, you enable me to be fully and readily employable and get on with my life advancing progressive causes and ideals, especially environmental and human rights concerns. A bonus is that I'll also be able to move forward on my goal of summiting all 67 of New England's 4000-foot peaks (currently, I'm on 25, eager to take on number 26). For this campaign, I've set a goal of $3000, less than what the Civic, minus operating expenses, swept out of my pocket since purchase ($1400 + tax in May, then about $2500 in various repairs since). I'm hoping that among the numerous friends who have supported and followed my personal, political and hiking endeavors this year and before there will be some who can chip in $25 or $50 or $100 or more toward that goal.  Thank you so much in advance if you are willing and able to help. And I promise, in return, if this campaign is successful, not only to continue my politcal activism, but to add service to people in need due to poverty to the works I engage in going forward. Registering people to vote at food pantries, soup kitchens and similar events in Hamilton, Ohio, was inspiring this summer and fall, and I want to continue serving people in need as a positive legacy, for me, of this year's political campaign."

This annual holiday project started by a group of students from the University of the Incarnate Word, St. Mary's University, the University of Texas at San Antonio, and high school students from Central Catholic has now evolved to become a citywide event celebrating San Antonio's growing diversity. Our city is one of the primary communities in the country where refugees are resettling to from conflict areas around the world.  Our goals for this toy drive continue to focus on building bridges of understanding among our city's refugee community and promote inclusion while celebrating the holidays.   With the help of numerous community members, local small business like SA Pops and organizations such as the San Antonio Brown Berets and Mystic Knights Car Club/Santa's Cruisers, we were able to grow the annual toy drive. Today, this annual toy drive serves both low-income families and recently resettled refugee children and their families.  For the past five years, we have assisted our new neighbors by bringing toys for the children and much-needed winter clothes for the families that now call San Antonio their home. All years combined, we have gifted toys to over 1,000 families. We are expecting to once again serve 400 families in the Auburn Creek Apartments and Wurzbach Manor Communities. For many of these children, it is their first time celebrating Christmas and the holidays. Any donation big or small makes a tremendous impact in making this toy drive a success. This GoFundMe campaign was created to help cover the operating cost associated with the annual drive, but primarily to raise funds to buy gifts for the children.

This campaign will not be easy, in fact it will be one of the hardest things I have ever done to date. However I am ready to fight for my beliefs and make you, the people, heard nationally. Currently the Republican Party has an issue of students being swayed into voting against us. I am here to say that I refuse to go silently into the night and I refuse to go down without a fight. A vote for me, is a vote for the future of the next generation of America and that is a future to believe in. As President of the Liberty Christian Young Republicans Club, I have successfully held my ground against student lead Democrat clubs, I have raised money for veterans organizations such as the American Legion and I have also been a major part of the GOTV movement and have set up several voter registration areas in the school so that all students may have an equal chance to vote on the future of our nation. Through all this experience however there is one thing that I believe sets me apart from the rest of the candidates running for this same position and that is my age. I am an 18 year old high school senior, and that gives me a unique perspective on everything. Many people have asked me, ""why would you waste your time, you are too young!"" To which I respond with this: I am fighting for not only my future but my children's and grandchildren's future. I see the importance of electing strong leaders today so that the next generation can thrive. Barack Obama's policies have set our nation back decades from where it could have been and I believe that it is time we elect a President who can help make this nation into what it once was. If elected to be a national delegate I will choose the leaders of tomorrow so that your children and my children have a better chance of success and living the American Dream! I believe in electing the leaders of the future and if I am elected to be a national delegate, I promise that I will represent the views of the people of Texas's 26th Congressional District and that we the people are heard loud and clear at the national level.I need help funding this campaign, as I have said I am a high school student and I cannot fund this alone. I need the help of everyday people like you. Thank you for your help, God bless you and God bless the United States of America!"

Listen to the Sheriff Joe Arpaio Interview Not Liberal vs Conservative The Fight is Freedom vs MarxismFor more than ten years people would ask me if I was a Republican or a Democrat?  As the NightTalker Radio Show became more popular, people would ask - Are you a Liberal or a Conservative?  These terms are false constructs to confuse a dumb population.  The real fight is a Free Constitutional Republic versus a Totalitarian Marxist State.  Twenty years ago the Bad Guys were very cunning and sneaky as they sought to overtake the nation.  Today they do not even try to hide their aims… which is why the free speech issue is now more than ever so critically important. We Need Your Help to SurviveSome tasks in life are more important… bigger… than any one person can handle.  This is one of those times.  They came after me and our show… they shut us down financially… and no one helped.  Then they came after the Big Boys like Michael Savage… and no one is helping.  When they start coming after you… it will be too late.  With your help… let’s make a stand now!  For Free Speech… and a Free Constitutional Republic!Our Needs - And How Each Gift Donation HelpsOur reach goal on this platform may look large, but by media terms it is actually quite modest.  Our studio is already in place, our production team is ready to go.  Where we need help is to cover expenses for studio re-configuration, staff salaries, a new form of distribution that cannot be censored by the monster tech giants, new format pre-production, original music, the addition of a new video channel, legal help, payment of past vendor bills, heightened security, a new, more secure web site, a good broadcast distributor… and the development of blockchain technology so that no tech giant can ever delete or censor media materials again. What if we don’t meet our full reach goal?  Then, our Plan B will be to use the gift donations offered here to deal with the most urgent and pressing agenda items and do our best to find the rest of the funding elsewhere. The Founding Fathers Died BrokeIf one’s goal in life is to die with the biggest pile of money… most Americans, including me, have most likely already lost that game.  This was true of many of the Founding Fathers.  But they believed enough in the importance of living as free men and women under a Free Constitutional Republic that they were willing to risk it all.  I have been willing to take that risk, too… but now I need your help. The NightTalker Radio Show Founding PlatformRead the Omaha Declaration"

He never got justice for what happened to him. Despite trying to tell a teacher about what was happening, that teacher chose to protect his rapist instead of him.In 2001, when Mark was in my early 30s, he finally confronted his rapist. Goldberg admitted on camera to repeatedly raping Mark when he was a student in Goldberg's school. Unfortunately, it was too late. By the time Mark had confronted him, Goldberg was already being protected from prosecution by New York State law. Despite giving a full confession on camera, during which he actually exposed himself to Mark again, Irwin Goldberg never even saw the inside of a courtroom. He was allowed to retire on a generous pension paid for by New York taxpayers, and has never faced justice.In New York State, thousands of survivors like Mark never seen justice for what happened to them. Victims of child sexual abuse in New York State only have until their 23rd birthday to sue or press charges. On average it takes survivors well into their 30s and 40s to finally come forward about sexual abuse. The current statute of limitations does nothing but ensure that predators who rape children in New York State are safe from the law.For 12 years we've been trying to change that. For 12 years we've been trying to pass the Child Victims Act, which would extend the civil and criminal statutes of limitation, and open a one year window during which survivors like me could bring our abusers and the institutions that protected them to court to identify and sue them, and finally get some justice.For 12 years, Senate Republicans have been blocking any attempt to pass the Child Victims Act. Despite its passage for the past three years in the Assembly, Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, at the behest of powerful special interests like the New York Catholic Conference, Agudath Israel of America, Boy Scouts of America, the American Insurance Association, Liberty Mutual, and Zurich Insurance, has been preventing the Child Victims Act from even reaching the floor of the senate for a vote.This past year, we were able to flip the New York State senate majority to the Democrats, and with that we were guaranteed passage of the Child Victims Act. While it is scheduled to pass within the next few days, Mark incurred several hundred dollars of expenses over the past few months to go up to Albany and fight for the Child Victims Act. Not only is Mark asking for help to cover those expenses, your donations will also help him finally pursue justice against his abuser, Irwin Goldberg, and the school administration that covered up what Irwin Goldberg did to Mark. Thank you so much for your support."

I am the Author of the book, “The Incredible True Story of Blondy Baruti. My Unlikely Journey from the Congo to Hollywood.” I am also an actor. I want to inspire the America through my life experience in the Civil War of the Congo, and onto the American dream.  I AM A LIVING EXAMPLE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.  I am an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I am NOT A DEMOCRAT or a REPUBLICAN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. I simply believe in LOVE, COMPASSION, KINDNESS, and doing what is right.  I fled my country as an immigrant almost 10 years ago from Civil War in search for a better life in America. America gave me a new HOPE, a SECOND CHANCE in life, and an opportunity to live the AMERICAN DREAM (Today I am an author, actor, and young entrepreneur) Watching how these innocent young girls, boys, and families are being treated at the southern border breaks my heart. I was one of those kids, still am, and always will be one of them. I know how it feels to be involved in the middle of a war that I had nothing to do with. I know how it feels to beg for water, food, bed, and a house to lay my head down. I know how it feels to walk hundreds of miles searching for a safe place (For them America!) I know how these mothers and innocent kids are feeling because I lived it myself with my mother and sister. Of course, the last thing I wanted to hear after reaching our final destination was, “You CANNOT come in!” Being rejected after a long journey of survival is devastating. I feel pain in my heart for these kids and families. It hurts me deeply to see them being treated this way just because they are searching for a better life in America, especially after walking hundreds of miles to reach THE LAND OF THE FREE AND HOME OF THE BRAVE. If you don’t believe me PLEASE feel free to read my book and learn about my journey.  I believe immigrants should come to the US LEGALLY just like I did, and I also believe with all my heart that when your brothers and sisters knock at your door begging for help, we should not turn our backs on them, but should open our doors to them. We should share what we have, feed them, and help as much as we possibly can. That’s the RULE OF LOVE.  I believe in America with all my heart. If America can raise  20 MILLION dollars to build a wall which I have NO PROBLEM WITH THIS. YES, I believe America should be able to raise triple that amount to help innocent children and families in desperate need of our help.  To my brothers and sisters who believe that the wall must be built, you have the absolute right to believe so. DIFFERENT OPINIONS MAKES THIS COUNTRY GREAT. Helping those young innocent young girls and boys in need by bringing them tents, shoes, clothes, water, and hopefully lawyers to help them with asylum is the right thing for me to do.  I’d like to start this fundraiser to bring HELP to those kids and families in our southern Borders.  How can you trust this is NOT a scam?

The full DNC will meet this Thursday, Friday and Saturday in Washington DC.  What will happen at these ""public"" meetings?  The only way to know is to:A.  Attend the meeting yourself, ORB.  Make arrangements with the DNC to read the transcripts months after the meetings ORC. Watch it on my Facebook LIVESTREAM so that you and others can watch this public meeting in our pursuit for truth and transparency. I hope you help with Option C, otherwise, we may never know what decisions are made about our party. There a few important issues that may be discussed at this DNC meeting that we want to follow:  1.The Alabama Democratic Party Challenge MIGHT be heard on Thursday morning. 2. The Puerto Rico challenge might be address in Rules and Bylaws on Friday morning. 3. The issue of whether the DNC will accept donations connected to fossil fuels may be debated at some point (maybe Resolutions) or on the floor on Saturday and 4. Dr Jim Zogby has a proposal from the Unity Reform Commission report that was overlooked by the Rules and Bylaws. That may get addressed in Rules and Bylaws on Friday.   Why do we want to know what happens at these meetings? We just wrapped up two years of advocating for major reforms within the DNC, especially reforming superdelegates, and had huge success!  However, it is no secret that many of the DNC members fought the reforms, but felt pressure from grassroots Democrats across the country that were demanding transparency and fairness.  It is also not a secret that DNC members were told that the reforms weren't permanent and could be changed later.  I would hope that the DNC members would not reverse the reforms they just passed, but how will we know if we don't keep our eyes on them?  After the 2016 DNC Convention, I have been at every DNC meeting possible and began LIVESTREAMING to share what I was learning with others.  I've learned valuable information every time.  At first, I did this all on my own dime.  Then, one DNC member attacked me and accused me of being a Russian operative and working for Vladimir Putin with the intent to destroy the Democratic Party!  The grassroots was furious and many people stepped up and offered to help not only cover costs, but to watch and  share the LIVESTREAMS, which created even more transparency.I want to be clear that my intention is to make sure that grassroots Democrats know what is happening in OUR party. Republicans need to fix their dysfunctional party and Democrats need to fix ours.  I do not want the Democratic Party to fail. In fact, as long as we have a two-party system, I want the Democratic Party to succeed and thrive and work for the people they claim to care about.  Unfortunately, I don't trust that this will occur without us watching and advocating within the party.  If you can, and if you would like to support the DNC Watch Puerto Rico LIVESTREAM for the next DNC committee meetings,  you can make a donation here.   I will Facebook LIVESTREAM the DNC Rules and Bylaws and Executive Committee Meetings on my FB Page - https://www.facebook.com/selinavickerswv/  You can also find other LIVESTREAMS on that Facebook page by looking at the ""Events"". You can also find links at https://www.selinavickers.com/livestreams  Expenses for this trip will include gas (I'm driving my car),  lodging, travel around the city (bus, uber, taxi), meals and wifi at conference center, if needed.   No rubles accepted.  By donating, you are confirming that you are an American citizen.Thank you for your support!"

My Campaign Patrons are Councillor Alex Watson OBE, who led Derwentside District Council for many years, and Davey Ayre, a legendary local trade unionist. I was born in 1977, and I have lived in North West Durham since 1982. I was an elected member of Lanchester Parish Council from 1999 to 2013, a governor of Lanchester Endowed Parochial Primary School from 1999 to 2007, and a governor of Saint Bede’s from 2000 to 2008. I am one of Derwentside’s elected public governors of County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust. I was elected unopposed. I first appeared on television in defence of Shotley Bridge Hospital in 1997. At around that time, I was the first journalist to try and expose the links between Harriet Harman and the Paedophile Information Exchange. There is certainly going to be another hung Parliament. The price of my support for any Government would be the necessary support for a number of projects in each of the former District Wards equal to the former number of District Councillors, together with justice for the 472 Teaching Assistants whose pay Durham County Council had cut by 23 per cent, together with not less than the level of hospital provision in Consett in July 2019, and together with the implementation of the plan for the rail service that had been advanced by The Northern Echo in June 2018. In Lanchester, the three projects would include proper flood defences, and the restoration of full bus services. In Weardale, I would require the Sixth Form provision on which the former MP had said a lot but delivered nothing. The Conservative candidate won 34.5 per cent in 2017. Labour holds fewer than half of the County Council seats in North West Durham. The Liberal Democrats cut the Labour majority in half in 2010. An Independent kept his deposit both in 2005 and in 2010. Therefore, I would appoint an Independent, a Labourite, a Conservative and a Liberal Democrat in each of the County Wards, ideally including at least one person in each of the former District Wards, to work with me and with local people. I would also appoint a Political Advisor from within each of the Independent, Labour, Conservative, and Liberal Democrat blocs.I believe in economic equality and international peace through the democratic political control of the means to those ends. Therefore, I support Brexit, Modern Monetary Theory, the Universal Basic Income, rural working-class representation, mass classical education, publicly owned utilities, Julian Assange, Chris Williamson, the British coal and steel industries, nuclear power, the Belt and Road Initiative, a British Glass-Steagall Act, democratic political control over monetary policy, the abolition of NHS charges, and putting Tony Blair on trial for Iraq. I oppose Trident, NATO, Saudi Arabia, all of the drugs that are currently illegal, and the so-called sex industry. The problem with the world is not that it has people in it. Which people, exactly? Instead of a halt to industrial and scientific progress, even the resources of the Solar System must not be beyond our reach as a species. Gender self-identification denies the basic scientific fact that is biological sex. As a mixed-race person, I support immigration controls. The IHRA Definition of Antisemitism silences Black And Minority Ethnic, refugee and migrant voices, and that way lies Windrush and Grenfell Tower. Being disabled, I support hugely expanded public transport, free at the point of use. I support fathers’ rights. I am a practising Catholic. My pamphlet The People’s Voice is available on Amazon.

This flood came 88 years after the infamous Great Flood of 1889 that killed more than 2,000 people in Johnstown. As they had in the first flood, the dams in the Conemaugh Valley failed, bringing disaster to the town.The flood occurred when an extraordinary amount of rain came down in the Conemaugh Valley in a short period of time. Nearly 12 inches were measured in 10 hours. The National Weather Service later estimated that this amount of rain in that location should happen less than once every 1,000 years.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Notes that The flood occurred when an extraordinary amount of rain came down.

Government officials are now completing plans to make Shasta Lake even larger by raising the height of the dam. The proposed dam expansion is motivated by California’s projected population growth and increasingly limited water storage options. The estimated cost of adding 18 1/2 feet to the 600-foot edifice is over $1 billion.Unsurprisingly, the expansion proposal has sparked intense debates among local residents, Central Valley farmers, environmentalists, tribal groups and developers.‘Somebody hit the wrong button’: Thousands in Shasta Lake city were evacuated accidentally, sheriff says Shasta lake's Dam thy are adding 18 & 1/2 feet on top of the existing dam what will the do in another 50 years make the dam taller.  the problam is at the bottom of the the floor has come up wpth silt and lesson the room for water, Silt crowding out drinking water in reservoirsThe better way is TOM'S way“Last June 29/ 2018 I met with the City Manager Greg Catton, Randi Kim and another person by the name Scott to Introduce Tom Industries LLC TOM capabilities of removing silt,as we visited and we did spend some time together talking about our water shortage in the Mesa County and at Carson lake and asked if the new anything about Carson lake a nd to my surprise their answer was no nor had they been at the lake and had no information at all.“(Last June 2018 I met with the City Manager Greg Catton, Randi Kim and another person by the name Scott to Introduce Tom Industries LLC So I informed them about the condition of Carson Lake}” by saying Carson Lake went into service in 1887 and that it was in service for 59 years when the city of Grand Junction notes that Carson lake was going to be in trouble with water storage if something wasn't done, so a 50 foot dam was built for more water storage.I informed the city manager and the water Director engineer that carson lake was in worst condition today than in 1946.With the information I shared with them it must have woke the city manager and water Director engineer and opened their eyes to the condition of carson lake?

Clean water comes from healthy streams, but healthy streams are also an important part of the world around us. To have a steady supply of clean water to drink, we pay for our water treatment plants to withdraw water from local streams, wells, or springs and use chemicals and other processes to make it clean and safe. The dirtier the water, the more it costs to clean it, and the more we have to pay for drinking water. Water can be so dirty that it isn’t feasible to make it clean enough for drinking water. The cleanliness of water also impacts agriculture, recreation, industry, wildlife, and other aspects of life. To understand how our water can be kept clean so there is usable water now and in the future, we must first understand how the water cycle works. We must also understand how water moving through this cycle affects and is connected to the plants and animals that live in and around streams, lakes, and wetlandsThe silt at the bottom keeps the water polluted.  Describes how water exists and moves on, and above the Earth. This cycle is continuous and doesn’t have a point where it starts or ends. This description begins with the oceans, where most of the water on Earth exists. The sun heats water in the oceans and evaporates some of it into the air. As this water vapor rises, the air cools and causes the vapor to become clouds. As the wind moves the clouds over the land, the clouds become larger with water vapor that has evaporated from the water already on the land and with the water vapor given off by plants, transpiration. Changes in temperature cause the water vapor in the clouds to fall out of the sky as precipitation. The precipitation can fall as snow, sleet, or rain. As rain falls or snow melts, it begins to soak into the ground. If there is too much water too quickly, the plants can’t soak it up fast enough and the spaces between soil particles are filled. The water that can’t soak in begins to move across the top of the land as runoff. Any materials on the land, such as dirt, chemicals, oils, fertilizers, etc., whether naturally occurring or put there by humans, are carried along with therun off. These materials that are picked up by the runoff and carried into streams and lakes pollute the water and are called pollutants. The water that soaks into the ground becomes groundwater which is discussed in other section. The runoff is moved downhill by gravity until it reaches a common low point and forms a stream. This stream can join with another stream and become a bigger stream that continues to be moved by gravity to a common lower point on the land. These bigger streams can join together to form even bigger streams, and so on. A stream that flows into another stream is called a tributary of that stream. Eventually all streams flow to the lowest surface points on earth, our oceans, seas, and lakes, where the water cycle continues with evaporation.Eventually all streams flow to the lowest surface points on earth, our oceans, seas, and lakes. These materials that are picked up by the runoff and carried into  lakes pollute the water and are called pollutants t and in time  sink to the bottom.There are a total of 75 thousand dams and reservoirs in the United States and all of them are in the same situation they are filling up with silt and that is not counting lakes, Silt crowding out drinking water in reservoirs.The Daily SentinelQuote6/5/2018""Fishing bag limit at Carson lake""""Attention anglers: It's open season for fishing at Carson lake this summer.

The most famous of these occurred in 1936 and 1977. An exhibition of photographs of the 1977 flood by Merle Agnello of the Tribune-Democrat is shown in the stairwell of the Johnstown Flood Museum, and some photographs of the 1936 flood are also on display. Markers showing the high-water level for the 1889, 1936 and 1977 floods can be seen on the exterior corner of Johnstown’s City Hall.On March 17, 1936, Johnstown experienced a devastating flood caused by heavy runoff from melting snow and three days of rain. Before the waters receded the following day, the flood had risen to 14 feet in some areas. About two dozen people died in the flood, while 77 buildings were destroyed– nearly 3,000 more were severely damaged. Property damages were estimated at $41 million.A line of severe thunderstorms stalled over Johnstown on July 20, 1977, dropping as much as a foot of rain in some areas. Small streams – Solomon’s Run, Sam’s Run, Peggy’s Run – carved new channels and smashed through expressways, apartment buildings, factories and homes. An earthen water supply dam collapsed at Laurel Run Reservoir, one of several dams that failed. The waters overflowed the channel system in Johnstown that was to have left the city “flood-free.” However, according to later estimates by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the water level could have been as much as 11 feet higher if the channel system had never been built.https://youtu.be/WRfGAWRoT9MAn example of water pressure and energyhttps://www.kqed.org/science/7191/is-raising-shasta-dam-the-best-bet-for-californias-water-supplyJust north of Redding sits the imposing Shasta Dam, and behind it, the largest single reservoir in California, accounting for about 17 percent of the state’s total water storage capacity. Government officials are now completing plans to make Shasta Lake even larger by raising the height of the dam. The proposed dam expansion is motivated by California’s projected population growth and increasingly limited water storage options. The estimated cost of adding 18 1/2 feet to the 600-foot edifice is over $1 billion.Unsurprisingly, the expansion proposal has sparked intense debates among local residents, Central Valley farmers, environmentalists, tribal groups and developers.This addition of 18 and 1/2 feet to Shasta lake dam is going to become a ticking time Bomb. The spillway collapse in Texas is a good example what water can do. The 18 and 1/2 feet addition will back up approximal 7 to 8 miles that is a lot of water. the way the heavy rain storm they have in Redding California you'll have another spill over the dam or the wall like in 1997 -98, if the wall is up and it gives way their be no time to seek higher ground of course  there is the spillways to release water yet there will be a catastrophe.There is a better way it will not control Mother nature   , and it will help to make more water storage that is by doing it TOM Industries LLC way.

In 1985 my dad made some poor choices in his life, and went to work and attacked a coworker and was discharged from the military, we moved back home to live with my grandparents. My dad was an abusive alcoholic and he beat my mother and myself regularly.When I was twelve I had some major digestive issues and was forced to have my intestines untangled and my bowel tacked down, and my appendix removed. Around two years later I took a hard fall and busted up both of my knees, and had to have arthroscopic surgery. This is when I started to seriously gain weight, I was stuck in the bed much of the day and the pounds piled on. by the time I turned 18 and graduated from high school I weighed over four hundred lbs.Even dealing with the joint issues I stated working when I was fifteen years old working in a telemarketing office. Selling the Belleville News Democrat subscriptions. When I turned seventeen, I got a job working a Schmuck's in the video center, I worked there for a year before getting hired at Wal-Mart in the Electronics department, I worked my way up to Photo Lab Hourly Manager. After ten years, I moved on to working in an elementary school, and worked as a teachers aide with low functioning autistic students. I loved this job, but many of the students were aggressive. After I had a seizure last August, I fell out of a chair and shattered my shoulder, then this January I got up to get a blanket off the shelf, and fell the wrong way and broke my leg in three places. The next month I lost my balance and broke my right foot, and big toe on my right foot.Unfortunately, I won't be able to go back to work in the field I used to work in, I have alot of debt to take care of, and I need to return to school and get some certification to be able to find a new kind of work to do. All  money donated will go directly to paying for bills and enrolling in an online program to receive accreditation or a degree.Here are some photos of before my weight loss, and when I could still  go out and enjoy myself.

Made of bullet proof material the vessel will ensure the safety of border agents resulting in fewer injuries and active duty casualties.The vessel operates on top of the SMART Wall. The design includes multiple types of detection: Satellite, Motion, Vibration, Extreme heat, and utilizes a variety of energy sources: solar recharging, backup electric, back up propulsion and redundancy in systems. A key element to the system is the magnetic levitation and propulsion of vessels for extremely quick travel to any threat along the wall, greatly reducing response times.Heuer Labs can Build a Better Wall for Less MoneyCurrent Proposed costs:$23 Million per mileHeuer Labs LLC Smart Wall Costs:Not to exceed $18 Million per mile for the first 215 milesNot to exceed $14 Million per mile for the remaining 1795 milesSecuring our border does not mean locking the world out; not every immigrant is a friend nor is every immigrant a foe to America.

Our solution is simple: Let people tell their own stories. Give them the mic.Season 1: THE CLOSET (2019) - Our first season will focus on the nuances and complexities within LGBTQ+ culture, examining the impacts of shaming, conservatism, religion, U=U, the economy, among others, through a queer lens. Through unbiased, unfiltered reporting, INSIGHT will spend each season highlighting stories and experiences that dive into the most pressing issues effecting culture. By hearing real people's stories in their own words, we hope to unite viewers and build a stronger framework toward empathy and compassion as we pass the torch to the next generation. INSIGHT's mission is to create a space for us to learn about the human experience so that we feel less alone in our struggle. Think about it. What if it were possible to break down the labels that separate us?  "".... Gay, Straight, Bisexual, Trans, Queer, Non-binary, Republican, Democrat, Left, Right, Disabled, Ghetto, Immigrant, Deplorable, Undocumented, the 1%, Poor, Struggling, Homeless...."" Research shows online platforms and television media have negatively impacted interpersonal relationships. In today's social, political, and digital climate, we are more divided than ever before.WHAT IF: We could reverse the negative effects of social media and online depression by making it ""cool"" to care about others? INSIGHT is a movement. We are beyond excited to share our work with you all - but we cannot do it alone! Here's what we are asking of YOU: We are currently in pre-production for an intended season release in 2019.

Known on the mean streets of Florida as Shovel,this patriot is reaching out to his friends,non commie legal citizens,and Harley riding,beer drinking,woman chasing,fist fighting,Trump loving patriots for help!  Liquid has gathered on his frame and begun to rust out at a crucial connection point! Originally, we thought it was water that was causing the rust. However as it turns out it is actually the tears of Democrats and scorned women, along with Florida Salt Air that has caused the rust. We are asking the Public's help for donations to have this Milwaukee Vibrator repaired. It's estimated the total cost will be around $1,000.   This great, Harley riding Patriot has a little five-year-old Berserker at home along with a woman who doesn't work, can't cook, it won't wash a dish. All she does is sit on the couch and eat Fritos, dozens of bags at a time while watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians! The mother of his child weighs about 800 pounds and nearly crushed Mike's foot to the point almost had to be amputated. (Disclaimer--- just having a little comic fun with this article, Natalie has a job and does do dishes and she is a beautiful girl and nowhere near 800lb LOL) So clearly, you can see the only respite this poor man has from the stress and grind of home and work is the wind in his face, the knees in the breeze, and the bugs in his teeth. After that everything is allllllll---righhhhhttt.  We need the men like him in this country, to support the greatest president the world has ever known and possibly the orangest!   All donations are welcomed and especially encouraged ranging from $0.50 to $50,000.

Well guess what... we actually have Congress people, state politicians and even athletes and celebrities arguing that it's not an emergency!!When is murder, drugs and sex slavery not an emergency?

Uncover Facts To Give To The Justice Department To Prosecute Criminals  * Hire investigative reporters to do the research, investigations, interviews and due diligence on the projects we want to focus on (aka the lawsuits).* Any evidence that is uncovered that pertains to a possible crime, will be submitted to the Justice Department, contingent upon legal counsel.II. File Civil Lawsuits* Hire licensed attorneys-lawyers-law groups to file litigation for us. *  Subject to what our attorneys recommend on a case by case basis, we'll be filing civil lawsuits against people and/or companies that are either breaking the law &/or are doing things to hurt America and it's citizens.* Any financial gains from any lawsuits (aka winnings) will be used to file more lawsuits for more of the projects we want to focus on (see below) subject to any taxes &/or other expenses that we must pay. III. Help President Trump Get Reelected In 2020* Invest in a wide variety of methods to help President Trump get re-elected in 2020.* We'll be implementing a wide variety of marketing and advertising programs to show the Citizens of America  why President Trump is the best candidate to continue ""Making America Great Again!""* We'll also point out how evil Socialism and Globalism is and why the Socialists and the Globalists need to be stopped no matter what! PRELIMINARY LAWSUITS WE WANT TO FILE:Here Are The Initial Campaigns-Lawsuits That We Want To Start With:Suing States & Politicians Who Won't Fund &/or Support The Southern WallSuing States, Cities & Politicians Who Support Sanctuary CitiesSuing Planned Parenthood & Politicians Who Support AbortionsSuing States, Cities, Colleges & Politicians Who Restrict 1st AmendmentSuing States & Politicians Who Restrict 2nd AmendmentSuing States, Cities & Politicians Who Support Voting By Illegal AliensSuing Manufacturers & Politicians Who Support GMOsSuing States/Organizations Who Support Transgender Sports ContestsPlease see our website for the reasons, aka the ""grounds"", for filing the lawsuits. --------------------------------------------------------------FUNDING SCENARIOS FOR OUR LAWSUITS, A.K.A. OUR ""WAR-CHEST""American Citizens Participating:  If one million citizens (1,000,000) each donate ten dollars ($10.00) to our project  ""We The People Fight Back"", we would have approximately seven million dollars ($7,000,000) after GoFundMe fees, taxes & overhead expenses. That would allow us to file a wide variety of lawsuits  (and all the follow up legal work) that are important to patriotic Americans!If Trump Supporters Participate:  If we take the 63 million citizens that voted for President Trump, and each person donates ten dollars ($10.00) each, that would give our project ""We The People Fight Back"" approximately five-hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) after GoFundMe fees, taxes & overhead expenses! That would allow us to file hundreds of lawsuits (and all the follow up legal work) and if we win just a small amount of cases, it would literally change America for the better (in our opinion). If Christians In America Participate:  If the 60 million Christians that are currently in the United States believe in what we're doing (a.k.a. ""fighting evil), and each Christian donates ten dollars ($10.00) each, that would allow our project ""We The People Fight Back"" to raise approximately five-hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) after GoFundMe fees, taxes & overhead expenses. Similar to above, that would allow us to file hundreds of lawsuits (and all the follow up legal work) and the positive things that we could accomplish would be staggering!

I wanted to register as an Independent, at the time, but my parents discouraged me from doing so. They told me to register as either a Republican or Democrat so that I could vote in primary elections. I tried to do my best at staying informed and participating in the process. There were so many elections in which no opposing candidate ran. More and more, I felt as if none of the candidates on the ballet came close to representing something to vote ""for,"" and I found myself voting ""against"" the greater of two evils. After a while, I felt completely disenfranchised by the whole process. I felt that my vote didn't really matter. I felt that my voice was silent.Since then, I got married, had two beautiful children, bought a house, found a great job that I love, but something was still missing. I noticed the changes around me. The discontent with how our elected representatives are running things. The complete dysfunction in Washington and Harrisburg. I started to speak up. I became engaged in the process, even though I felt that my voice wasn't represented. At 18, I registered Republican because I believed in low taxes and small government. I didn't agree with a lot of what the party represented, but I thought that things could be changed from within. I was right, but not in the way I hoped. The party shifted out from under me, so I looked at the Democrats and noticed that they had moved farther away too.In Oct., 2018, My father, my hero, died after a long battle with cancer. Dad spent his life serving his community as a surgeon, a school board member, a volunteer for Meals on Wheels, an Elder in our church, and on and on. His death opened my eyes. Looking at his life, and realizing how much he gave to others, how much he loved every single person that he met, lit a flame inside me. It inspired me to do more. It inspired me to work to change the future for my children; for our children.I look at my kids and I can't see a future for them here. That's a terrifying thought, but it's true. If things continue down this path, I don't see a future for them. We need to do better. We need to work together and create solutions to our problems instead of holding to political agendas. We can build a better future for ourselves and our children if we just work together.I am running to represent the people in the middle. Those of us caught in the void between the two parties. Those of us that understand that real change comes when we work together on pragmatic solutions. Those of us dedicated to a brighter future.Please consider donating so that we can change our government to work with us on solving our biggest problems."

THERE IS NO LAW THAT SAYS I CAN'T OFFER FREE RIDES. LET'S DO THIS TO PROVE TO THE DEMS THAT WE WANT ACTION AND MAYBE THEY CAN STOP TRUMP BUT, I WILL STEP UP AND PROVIDE IMMIGRANTS FREE TRANSPORTATION TO SANCTUARY CITIES AND HUMANITARIAN AID.           I appreciate how hard Trump has been working to ensure our national and economic security , all while constantly encountering a barrage of different tactics in which the democrats  use to make the life of Donald Trump as unpleasant as possible only because they do not like him and only want to sabotage every good idea and policy he might have. Even though it is obvious to me and many others that  Trump has accomplished so much, all while being under constant attack and caught up in all of this Russian nonsence. It really is unbelievable. It is now time for a private citizen like myself and anyone who can  help fund this operation, to step up where our President is limited because of laws and bureaucracy.        This is not a joke or a hussell . Donald Trump just said something on the news that so many of us were already thinking but, lacking the political power to actually act on regarding the transportation of these illegal immigrants to the lovely sanctuary cities which are conveniently not located close to the border.  When I heard  Trump suggest this idea, I thought that it was brilliant but immediately became very controversial to Democrats. Of coarse the left immediately criticized the plan but, they do have their right....to be wrong.  So, I decided that I want to take on the job as a private citizen who is not restricted by laws of government and federal funding and purchase 1 used bus for the time being and personally drive down to the southern border. I will then offer our new friends a free ride to sanctuary cities, particularly, California and more specifically, very  close to where a special lady from the Democratic party resides. I am absolutely serious about doing this but, I naturally need funding for a used school bus that I already priced out, insurance, fuel,  tolls, humanitarian supplies for the riders and all other travel expenses. I am NOT trying to make a bunch of money for doing this but, since this  operation will be at least a month, I do still need  to be compensated for my time. I am going to try and reach out to some news outlets about this and also I plan to document  this endeavor, which I will upload to YouTube when possible.I really can not think of a better way we can show Trump  our appreciation then by stepping up to the plate and fulfil his plan in a way that is in no way illegal and a liability. By doing this, I really believe that it will set a tone in the media that a lot of Americans are getting fed up with the way we are forced to sit back and only watch as this crisis gets worse. Our government is obviously unable to solve this crisis  along with most issues.  It is time I feel ,that We the People step in and do whatever we can  because this only seems to be getting worse. As a private citizen, I am not bound by the same limitations  as the government is and best of all, the democrats can not legally prevent me from doing this. I am in no way a racist or think anything less of the people who come into this country but, life is filled with lines for the sake of fairness and order. It is very sad that I am able to do this so easily but the President of the United States is unable to act on so many obvious national security issues.I am in no way implying that Trump does not know how to solve A lot of the countries issues,  there is simply  a few dimwits on the left who unfortunately have certain powers in government that make any opposing idea impossible to get any real traction . Please consider this and follow on YouTube if I can raise the funds.  This is only the beginning and if everything goes as  planned I hope to get more support and future funding. I do understand that this is not a immediate fix  the crisis, it is simply just a small act but, the meaning will surely be  great  because this will send a huge reality check to the ones in powerful positions that if they can not put aside their personal vendettas  towards a president  that might not be a perfect person all the time but that is because he is not a fake politician but rather a overall average American who has done more for this country to ensure a prosperous future then any other President in my 33 years of life and not for personal gain, regardless of what you might think and definitely not a Russian agent and to say otherwise is simply counterproductive to this country and blatant ignorance.This will be a new movement towards a more productive and efficient government and  show the world that we know how to solve complex problems with simple solutions. The world used to respect the U.S. And look to us for guidance and security. I feel that a lot of people are  not aware that the world is still watching as we struggle and struggle to get absolutely nothing done and if we do not take the initiative sometimes and step in as citizens when issues become complicated, our society as a whole will  no longer be the gold standard in the world  but, rather another bad example of  what happens when people  become to dependent on a government to solve problems and forget they still have a voice but, only if  they speak up and take action when needed. Unfortunately this seems to be one of those times. "

 I was in California to visit my daughter and attend the 75th birthday tribute to Joni Mitchell. When my daughter dropped me off, I turned on the television to see the massacre at Borderline in Thousand Oaks. My daughter mentioned to me that she had been thinking of going there the week before as she is a fan of country music.

 

Then soon there  after the wildfires started and I would watch intermittently. My heart sank as I watched people lose their possessions -  furniture, dishes handed down, photos, heirlooms, entire homes, but I was thankful that we weren’t seeing human and animal casualties.   But then came the news of a town in northern California named Paradise that was, basically, wiped away , ravaged by these powerful fire bowls.

 

I have spent an in ordinate amount of time trying to reason with Trump supporters, to no avail.I  feel I should be doing something to help you here, even if in some small way.You  see, I was staying in Valley Village with a beautiful pool and noticed that a  film started to appear and you could see a “film,“ if you will, in the air. I am a big believer that global warming plays a significant part in these events,  although I am not a scientist nor do I quite understand this subject more fully

 

This is my way of helping since I live in New York and my daughter lives in Los Angeles.

 

To everybody affected by these  terrible wildfires,  and in honor and memory of those “lost in paradise,“ I ask you to contribute whatever you can .   This is a bipartisan effort, a humanitarian  effort.   I don’t care if you are a Republican, Democrat, Independent.  I don’t care if you are  Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu or subscribe to any other religious or spiritual ideal, or if you are an atheist.   I care that you are human giving to other humans and animals to help just a little bit. Please give. No donation is too small and no donation is too big. THANK YOU!!!Lori Klausner

Between 2007 and 2011, I attended ITT Technical Institute. I worked hard every day I attended, I would stay  late and arrive early. I was committed to my education. Jump to now, 2019, I do not work in my field of education and have a student loan debt balance of $75,000(see pictures below). Why is that? Well the very short answer is ITT Technical Institute did not do right by its students. The for-profit college closed its doors in 2016 after having its funding pulled by the federal government. ITT Technical Institute is hardly the only for-profit college that failed to do right by students. Please read: My Argument for Student Loan protection and forgiveness

Even though ITT Technical institutes doors are no longer open, the ramifications many former students face go on. My Current Debt- April 2019  The good news is I have managed to maintain good standing and make my on time payments. The troubling part is: Current Projection Timeline- Student Loan debt will follow me until age 55 Its hard to fathom being able to maintain payments until that age without any snags along the way. As things are, I'm currently directing half of my monthly income to pay the minimum due on my loans. a couple years ago I worked 2 jobs to try and get ahead of the problem. Unfortunately after about a year of doing that, I had health reasons arise preventing me from continuing to work 2 jobs.

I have voiced my concerns regarding lack of protection  around student loans to my state representatives. filed claims against ITT Through my state attorney generals office and the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau. I have applied for a defense to repayment for my federal loans owned by the department of education. I will continue to reach out and spread the word about the situation many students like myself are facing.

If you can help me recover from the financial burden in any way, I would greatly appreciate however much you are able to give. If you are unable to give at this time, please consider sharing this page and help me get the word out.

Jerry created this terrible story up to here, but we are going to write the final chapter in this bookof evil. Dylan and I wrote the 4th book, “The Greedy Business of Life” in 2004 as a 443-page movie screenplay this is NOW the second time;    EVIL PEOPLE  have tried to destroy our lives. Today, our focus is on exposing each of these people to the light of public awareness, their invasioninto peoples lives have been going on for a long time.There will be nowhere for these ANTI-MARINE, ANTI-MILITARY AND ANTI-AMERICAN despicable people to hide, when we expose them in:                                                      Winchester Bay, Oregon                                                       Reedsport, Oregon                                                       Paso Robles, California  -  The Hometown of Felgenhauer Construction                                                      San Diego, California       -  The Home town of Suder Reality  As you will read; after the ""Peeping Tom"" incidents it was then a cat that ignited Jerry's sick emotional harassment and invasion into our lives defying every legal request of documented letters from our 4-Attorneys. When even these legal demanding requests were completely ignored we sent a special request from Denise's own Dr. Simpson for Jerry to ""give us quiet enjoyment"" and requested the Jerry give us another 6-months lease because of Denise's ongoing rehabilitation and the financial stress this HOSPITALization-ordeal has caused.  To a normal person this would mean to have compassion or ""Do the Right Thing"", but this was like ared flag for a bull . . . . .To charge at the helpless with his personal vendetta of retaliation against the lives of Denise and Dylan. I wanted to teach on the coast, but was not sure from Brookings to Newport this is why Windy Bay, the location, I could teach and look for the right town up and down the coast for the right house to buy. Today, I have not worked in 2-years we have paid all our bills, but our savings to buy a house is gone, now we have just 30-days to pack and move:Jerry retained Attorney David Tilton of Coos Bay, OR to legally document his vengeful evil-campaign against Denise and Dylan and to the world. Since Mr. Tilton has been a practicing Oregon Attorney for 33-years we can only presume Jerry and David have been doing business for many years. When you read Davids Letter of Termination stating our $1,000 deposit, but he amazingly leaves off the $600 cat deposit from his Evil Declaration Letter of Termination !As a practicing attorney for 33-years did Attorney David Tilton just forget to ask Jerry for a copy of the Original Contract he was legally enforcing for Jerry & Kim Felgenhauer? I believe a 1st-year law student would have asked to see the ORIGINAL CONTRACT, so the evidence suggests their business relationship was strong enough; it was totally irrelevant for Attorney David Tilton to request or even to look at the original contract before writing his Attorney Letter.If David had even asked to look at the 2-different originally signed contracts weeks apart, there was a $300 cat deposit, which was omitted from his attorney letter. Next, maybe Attorney David Tilton should have even gone farther and asked his GOOD FRIEND Jerry if there was an addendum's to the Original Contact. In this 33-year of experience, Attorney David Tilton should have learned this procedure, as there was an addendum with an additional $300 cat deposit. So, Attorney David Tilton and Jerry & Kim Felgenhauer decided after 2-years of endless harassment to omit the $600 cat deposits, which was the TOTAL FOCUS of Jerry's harassment, stalking, bullying of Dylan for the past       2-years and the illegal termination of the contract forcing us to move. Attorney David Tilton lists; 590 Commercial Ave, Coos Bay, OR 97420 as his office, but on Google Earth it is an empty lot. We couldn't help but wonder why an attorney of 33-years would have listed this address as the actual Business Law Office address?Now, after you read our story, I wonder how many will think this was just an accident or was this a terrible felony of collusion to fraud in writing?  This will be for the Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Fredrick Boss, Deputy Attorney General to investigate and charge; as the documents validate this illegal defraud with evil dishonesty.                                     THIS IS THE  STORY OF OUR DECLINING HEALTH, DETERMINATION                                                                               TO DEFEND OUR GOOD NAME                                                                                                                and                                                                         THE STORY CONTINUES TO THIS DAYDylan was moving out of state and when Jerry learn this. . . . . WE knew it would be impossibleto get the deposit money we deserved from  Jerry & Kim Felgenhauer! We anticipated every move Jerry made against us and we discussed these things in writing with our Attorneys who were somewhat amazed when Dylan would tell them what Jerry would do next to harm our good name  AS the hatred of Evil is very predictable in the behavior of human emotions.The male communist pig has forced us to move and given us a bad rental history and Dylan has 12-days before he even gets the u-haul. The duress Jerry has exploded upon us, tears at OUR HEALTH every day a 1,000% and has since the dreadful day,  I left TEXAS and I met these Hate-filled Evil people in from Robles, California and Reedsport &Winchester Bay, Oregon.   OUR  TERRIBLE  TIMELINE - BOOK  BEGINS:May 1, 2016 - I was an English Teacher for the Clearlake and Hitchcock HISD Schools in Houston Texas. I flew to Portland Oregon and then rented a car and drove 200-miles to Winchester Bay Oregon and met with Jerry and Kim Felgenhauer to inspect the house the trip cost was $700. I rented 1050 Broadway Ave in Winchester Bay, Oregon the contract was for 2-years  with the first month $1000, $1000 house security and $300 cat deposit. I argued with him about the 2-year contract and not the 1-year we had discussed on the hone when I was 2500-MILES away in Houston.                                                                          THIS WAS A BIG RED-FLAG AND I MISSED IT. . . . I called Dylan and we decided we would not be rushed to get a job and find the house of our dreams to retire.May 15, 2016 - Dylan has been an art collector for 30-years and he is a painter and is the happiest when he is living near the ocean, so he moved first to continue writing his book “theEthics” of Honorable Intelligence Poetry & Songbook to publish. We decided I would to stay in Houston in the apt and work and save some more money for a house, while Dylan would move everything out of our storage and put the house together. It's is very chaotic the first 2-months, he has a large library, many paintings, and music studio besides all the couches and furniture. I planned to move after school closed in December 2016.         This is a picture of Dylan's bookcase in Houston and Oregon then  below                                      HERE WAS OUR  DINING AND LIVING ROOM IN OREGON                                                                       Dylan's bookcase is on the left in this picture                                                                                             Dylans Office in OregonThis is Dylan office if you look at the wall on the right, the 2-pictures next to the cabinet arepictures of Quantuum Physics and would CHANGE today's understanding of the Origins of this COSMOS.The pictures come from Dylans 7th book. Comrade JERRY & KIM absolutely prevented thecompletion of this book for the world, these are the direct consequences of Dictatorial-Communistic California Propaganda of EVIL in OREGON!!!                             This is part of the living room and oil painting of The Great Wall of China 9x5.85 ftI was a Texas Realtors and Dylan had his Texas Teal Estate License we have bought and sold houses in 3-different states these things take months, I had a new job and so Dylan stayed to finalize the sale of our house, but we communicated very well in e-mails or on the phone.The day Dylan moved into the house Jerry used Jim McPeek’s house next door to park his truck, Dylan could not see the truck from our house because the boat was in the way.  Jerry began walking between the houses looking into Dylan’s office windows, as he was unpacking, working and then looking in the back patio door as he walked past the back of the house to his other rental property down the block.  The cats knew when the deer were outside and as they sit by his computer when they turned their head, he knew it was COMRADE JERRY.JERRY WOULD WALK BETWEEN THE HOUSES, THE WINDOWS ON THE RIGHT ARE DYLANS OFFICE                                                                                  This picture is the front yard today. 5-15-2016 -Jerry seems to have forgotten again, the day Dylan moved into the houseJerry was mowing the 25x35 foot yard on his riding mower and was seeding the weeds and dirt spots in the front yard and he was in control of the sprinkler.  The dirt spots look beautiful this is the how front yard looked when we rented the house.The yard stops about 10-feet past the steps. Next, we only mow grass for 3-months, maybe, in Oregon because it always raining, not for an entire year. Jerry took complete control of the yard in 2016 and early 2017.JERRY NEVER ONCE IN 2-YEARS EVER TOLD US HE WAS COMING ON THE PROPERTY HE walked around the house and yard and mowed the yard until he forced Dylan to close all the blinds in the house   THE 1st MONTH HE WAS THERE because he never once knew or had any notice when Jerry was at the house or WALKING in the yard.  Dylan was laying in bed and had set the head of the bed to look out the window when he awoke. Instead, he sees JERRY HEAD he was either walking or driving his mower past his window looking in each window as he drove around the yard. We opened a legal case file to document Jerry’s unlawful conscienceless behavior and coming on the property without notice of any kind at that time.Dylan documented with the attorney his legal concerns about his protection under the Oregon Peeping Tom Laws; we began compiling the legal case the very FIRST MONTH. Jerry climbed on the roof to do something Dylan was in his office and freaked him out it was 6:30 am, never a call this was his property Renters Rights or Landlord Laws never meant anything to Jerry!!Jerry has used his property as HIS OWN PERSONAL  Psychological Destructive Weapon or tool to vindictively hurt Dylan and me to dominate our lives. WE now call JERRY'S Psychotic Behavior COMMUNIST-CALIFORNIA-TERRORISM  because to his day Jerry is proud of his destructive behavior on our lives.June 24,  2016 It took Dylan about 5-weeks to unpack the house and everything looked great, as usual, so we decided to invite Jerry, Kim, Karen, and Jim over to have a cup of coffee and see the house and open some conversation to get know each other. Dylan was really trying to make friends in this new State and town. The interesting thing was these         4-people walked through the house and never sat down on the couches or the many chairs saying very little in communication. They walked together they could not separate and never stopped to look at a single painting or statue.  The most surprising thing was no one spoke to Dylan and no one ever asks a single question about all the paintings, vases or statues. People usually asked 100's of questions and the firsts are how much is it worth, then how old is the paint. They walked through the house like people shopping to buy a house and had ALREADY decided upon entry they had mentally rejected the house, they when through the entire house in and out in about 8-10 minutes and hurried to the front door, barely saying goodbye, much less thanks for inviting them. Dylan had raspberry coffee and coffee cake, some fruit, some sodas, etc. All out on the counter in the kitchen, and Kim and Karen did not even look at the kitchen, maybe because their kitchens were less exciting without all the colors of copper and red theme. That's what it was the ladies did not like all the color in the kitchen, I always wore colored dress shirts under my suit, white was just ordinary.In reality, this house was like a beautiful dream they had never experienced and so their void in beauty cause each to hurry back to the front door where they felt safe from so much rich- beautiful color, but it might have been the simple truths of life, which beauty represents.            SO, maybe this was not so strange, this was admonishment from their deprived Soul and Spirit! People only see, what they can allow; into their narrow or uneducated minds. Their behavior was very strange, frighten almost, as they scurried from room to room never saying a word between them. Dylan and I were both Texas Realtors and we laughed this was the strangest Open House we had ever had, hands down.Dylan had hung all the paintings and the house looked beautiful, but when Jerry looked at Dylan's Marine Uniform, Dylan unknowingly asked if Jerry was in the military, Jerry never answered he just walked away and the other three just followed him like ducks out the front door, no goodbye or thank you. This is when we began anticipating Jerry's sinister motives of aggression, against us because behavior like this did absolutely have negative consequences.This really puzzled us since that very day, WE were both born in Texas a very proud Republican Red State. WE had never been introduced to this Communist Propaganda anti-Government and anti-Military this is not how an honorable American would behave, something was terribly wrong.                  WE had come face to face with Jerry's psychosis he was Anti-Military and Anti-MARINES!!            Jerrys California Propaganda of Hatred for the military WAS the source for his bullying, threats, and invasion into our lives for  2-years!! Jerry compounded his hatred by committing Grand Theft as he stole all of our Deposit Money.In retrospect: I think they had met a man, Dylan who was not interested in their California houses, boats, RV's or wealth and wanted to talk about the coast, and the State of Oregon. It took us a long time to actually figure out their strange behavior. Dylan and I have been Independent and  Republican for a long time.  Dylan is ALL for supporting the military, not striping the service of Officers, Senior NCO's and money because it weakens every Branch of Military service being an honorable Marine.   It never dawned on us :                   ""THIS WAS A POLITICAL, ANTI-AMERICAN & CULTURAL REBELLION AGAINST US"".                                    We were not moving thinking Democrat-Communist or a Republican State...                                                  WE just wanted to be near the ocean in a State,   so Beautiful. This terrible story is the results of a culture clash of AMERICAN IDEALS OF HONESTY & FAIRNESS,ideas of Compassion, with Principles, Moral, and Ethics. You will determine if Jerry, Kim, Karen, and Jim were bonded together because of their collective hollowness of essential personality characteristics, which are inherent to most normal American Human Beings!.............................................................................................................................................................................................................              EVERY HIP DISPLACEMENT WAS ALWAYS A JOURNEY INTO EXCRUCIATING PAIN !!1st Hip Displacement Dec 9, 2016 - I had a hip replacement in 2010 and I had no problems, then my whole life was turned upside down, I bent down and my right hip dislocated. I have never been in so much pain so I called 911 for an ambulance and was rushed to ER. An Orthopedic Doctor put my hip put back in place. I was sent home the next day December 10 my good friend Wendy picked me up from the hospital she had a seated rolling walker, which helped. I played sax in college and Wendy played the drums in our own girls' band we started in high school.I called Jerry to let him know and told him I was all packed to move to Oregon at the end of December then, I dislocated my right hip. Jerry hated to hear about this and asked several questions about when I would be coming to Oregon, which I thought was very strange.Dec 10, 2016 – I did not sleep well worrying about myself, Dylan and the future, but this Jerry business really distressed me. Dylan and I talked on the phone and he consoled me, but a woman knows when something is wrong, I just could not figure it out.Jerry's repeated directed questions about when I was coming out to Oregon and I just got out of the hospital and he is married this absolutely bothered me!2nd Hip Displacement Dec 11, 2016 - Didn’t sleep well, again Dylan and I talked all day about my condition and this Jerry business and when I went to sleep I tried to get up, my hip dislocated. I again called 911 and was rushed to the hospital ER. Well, the same thing happened again the hip-popped out...The Orthopedic surgeon had this special hip brace designed just for me because the muscles in the leg were too weak now to exercise. The worse picture I ever had taken in my life and I was so very unhappy a day after surgery. A nurse got this long shirt to cover my backside. I had to wear this brace around my chest and down both legs, day and night for weeks just thought you would like to see the visual pain and agony look at my face, no words needed this is the woman on the other end of the phone calling Dylan.I would not be able to get to Oregon to see Dylan because it takes at least 3-months to rehab. Now besides having the stress of rehab to my hip dislocation, I have this added stress of having to make a second phone call to Jerry and Kim Felgenhauer concerning why I had not moved. I explained to them I would be moving in March. I was the person in pain calling stating what happened and Jerry got mad ME . . . . .like I did this just to piss him off!!!!!!!!!!2 more days in the hospital and Wendy brought me to her house again, I could not stand or walk only sit and sleep. My son Tim lives about 500-miles away. This was now an emergency because Denise had doctors and rehab appointments scheduled in Big Springs.                                                                                          I COULD NOT DRIVE, SIT OR FLY TO OREGONTim came to pack up the truck with my furniture, bed etc. He drove the truck and Megan drove me to Big Springs to see my granddaughters Lilly 10 and Tifa 6 we were so happy to see each other. I began rehab, Tim took me to rehab and to get my prescriptions. 3rd Hip Displacement 1-24, 2017 - I had brought in the New Year going to rehab, which is very painful and difficult there is not enough TIME OR SPACE TO EXPOUND on the pain. So, I move wrong and it caused my hip to pop out. The ambulance took me to the ER and another hip operation and I went to Tim’s home the next day. You have no idea how tough this is for Dylan and myself, I love it here with the kids but I am not in Oregon and Dylan and I have been separated for almost a year now. Sometimes the best plans do not work out.3-18-2017 - Tim’s house was now 92 degrees, which was miserably hot to live in there was so little air-conditioning.  Their house was also roach infested; I begged them to let me pay for bombs or to pay an exterminator but they told me their cats were allergic to the spray on the carpet. I told them I would rent a carpet shampooer. The roaches would crawl on my legs while sitting in my chair watching TV in the living room and wake me up crawling on me under the covers. 3-19-2017 - Was I unhappy living in this pest-hole, there are no words.I help  Lilly and Tifa with reading, spelling, and math, I was shocked they were both 2-years behind other kids in education and Meagan is a Special Ed teacher. I told Meagan I had a book by Kahlil Gibran “The Prophet” and was easy words and reading to my granddaughters they had a hard time understanding simple metaphors and she told me to never teach her kids again. Physical Therapy made my hip so much stronger. At first, Tim would talk to me, and then as time passed he began emotional and verbal assaults toward me where he would scream and cuss at me for over an hour, trapping me in my room, standing in the doorway, even standing outside the door when I was in the bathroom.                                         He wanted BIG MONEY  $20-30,000 and not a couple hundred.Tim broke into my phone and got Dylan's cell and e-mail and sent some very nasty demand message to him.I could now take a taxi to go where I need to go. I began avoiding Tim, I also hated the fact he spanked both Tifa and Lilly MANY TIMES WITH HIS BIG HANDS there were bruises on their little butts, I could not stop it I was so afraid of what Tim would do..... he had now threatened me for money!! Dylan and I wrote this 15-page letter to the DA in Big Springs detailing the child abuse and the methamphetamine in the house. The file was passed to an investigator who never returned our calls and so far I have heard, he never interviewed Tim or Meagan. 4-28-2017 -Text from Jerry Felgenhauer  Inform Dylan to deposit an extra $50.00 for yard maintenance EVERY month. Jerry had been seeding the 20x35 foot front yard and mowing the small front lawn on his riding mower for years, but Jerry was busy trying to run everyone else's life, he did not know he had to kill the weeds before he seeded the yard!  haha                                                      THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF JERRYS THINKING PROCESS!!!!!The yard had several weed/ dirt spots in a 25x35 ft yard, when Dylan moved in and Jerry set and ran the sprinkler system, as it ran every day rain or shine trying to get the grass to grow without the weeds.  Now, thank GOD Jerry is so incompetent!! There were 1,000's of yellow dandelions in that small yard space and the deer loved the yard and would eat and sleep in the yard at 2 am,  haha the only good thing Jerry ever did, probably in his LIFE!!!Jerry has been mowing this yard on his riding mower for many years before we rented the house, plus he has to mow the 1.5 acres surrounding the property. This has nothing to do with the yard, if I was living there by myself this would not have ever been an issue!!!!!!Jerry created his own dislikes and class-prejudice against Dylan for whatever psychotic-perverse reasons and since Dylan is even more disabled because of his feet, he is waiting for 2-foot operations, mowing was impossible...... Jerry has used his property as a psychological destructive weapon or tool to vindictively hurt Dylan and me to dominate our lives WE now call this psychotic behavior Communist-American Terrorism because to his day Jerry is proud of his destructive behavior on our lives.I was experiencing living and dealing with this enraged Jerry who knew we did not have a lawnmower and Dylan needed foot surgery we documented everything in text messages. Now on top of the stress of my rehab, I was experiencing living in this enraged violent household with my son shouting verbal abuse at me. I found out he was on meth and had been arrested several times; then, there was Jerry, I had to handle this added difficulty with this disturbed long distance Kamikaze Slumlord. 5-1-2017 - I called Kim to give her the prognosis on my hip recovery and discussed the $ 50.00-yard maintenance fee. We agreed to $25 since the yard was so small and Jerry was on his riding mower and had mowed the yard for years and had to mow the acre next door, anyway. 5-2-2017 -  Jerry next came over to the house again without any notice and walked up onto the deck and looked through the 1/2 screen patio door to see Jay the cat!!!!!!!  I GOT A TEXT MESSAGE. Every other window has blinds and closed curtains because you can see through the entire open house if they are open to anyone just passing by the window. How would you like to rent a house and be forced to cover the windows the first month to maintain your privacy and personal freedoms from his mentally disturbed voyeurism?Dylan and I were mad because our attorney talked us out of filing Peeping Top Charges against Jerry. The sun shines directing at the patio door, the sunlight reflects back at you and the screen shades the glass. To look into the house you have to put your hands up on the screen to look inside from morning till dark as in summer the sun shines through the patio door every day. Jay is grey totally impossible to see. We are not going to talk about, looking through the patio door at night, but we feel this was the only way because the cats lay 20-feet away from the sliding door by the gold glass bar!! There were several big cats that came by the back patio for years and clawed-up the screen trying to get at Mr. Wu and Jay they even sprayed on the screen, so he likes to lay far away by the grandfather clock.Every other window has been covered with curtains for over a year. This was the only opening in the house to look outside at the world day and night  for Dylan for 2-years, he walked up and looked out at least 10-times a day or 8,300 times in 2-years because when you write every day you must get up and walk every 30 minutes at 67 to look at Jerry's trash trailers, cinder blocks and trash for 2-years we talked about this ""EVIL MONSTER JERRY FUCKNHAUSER""  every single day. Dylan was working on his 7th album, but he never even put the music- studio together because Jerry put the cinder blocks right outside that window this was the worse 2-years of Dylan's life, do YOU want to rent this house from Jerry!Oh great, now I was going to have to deal with this ""Peeping-Jerry-Issue"" this seemingly lawless and unstable COMMUNIST-Landlord on top of dealing with my psycho son, too much trauma for this Texas English Teacher!This Chinese screen illuminated the room with beautiful colors because Jerry piled the cinder blocks, the trash trailers, and other crap right outside in visual range after Dylan closed ALL/EVERY the window blinds and curtains. Who would be so terrible? Jerry personally stacked every cinder block, he could have stacked them in the back of the yard or maybe somewhere else, why right under our patio? Do you understand real human EVIL by definition MUST combat the goodness of honorable people and you can see Jerry's hatred demonstrated with every intrusion of harassment into our lives?The mother brought her male and female fawns to see Dylan the first week and they each returned tosee him at 2-4am until the day he left. Dylan did not mow the front yard in 2018 because it was full of dandelions a sea of yellow and at 2-am he would open the door, there would be his deer sleeping or eating and he would sit on the step and talk to them. Dylan truly lives in a world of beauty and only wanted to create and write in peace and Jerry HATRED made sure that was TOTALLY impossible.Dylan is up all night writing and walking outside on the back porch watching the stars and made friends with all the raccoons, possums, feral cats, a gray fox and his pet deer who HE would call with just his voice and they would come running across the open field  with theirs down shaking back and as they ran across the open field to him. The first month Jim McPeek yell across the fence at Dylan while he was feeding the deer each day, telling him he should stop feeding the deer, he just laughed this was a real joy for Dylan the poet.Because his mom brought him and his sister to see me, even when they were alone in the back they would come running when I called them with a special sound that all my animals come to it echoes off the snow and they run from 2-300 ft away. I have to keep making the sound so they can hone into the locationThis is the male fawn with antlers he would walk up and look through the dining window for Dylan to come and he like it when Dylan would talk to him he called ""Mr. Happy Face"" he would shake his head and just stare at DylanThe 2-dawns the brother & sister above were Dylan ONLY companions, as the stayed close to the house year round and Dylan watched them grow as he feed them bread. Mom would come back every few weeks and there was always a reunion and mom brought other deer to see Dylan. I only wish; I had been there to see and enjoy the happiness, but these stories are wonderful as we were going through HELL!BEFORE, I rented the house I asked Jerry to remove the trailer, the railroad rectangle and trash heap in the back he agreed, of course, JERRY is a habitual LIAR.  You can see there are NO Cinder blocks, trash trailers or wooden crap by the back patio!!!No, this was Jerry's calculated aggression against Dylan and myself because the paintings and furniture in the house were so beautiful and we are happy people. The deer were Dylan's only friends in Winchester Bay as people watched him feed them in the front and backyard.  Jerry was out to close the only sunlight left coming into the house! Look at the back of the yard 2-trash trailers and Jerry does not mow HILL or the yard until the weeds/grass gets 4-foot high look down the fence because it is 4-foot high it is where Jerry put the 12x18 ft wooden frame right out the 3ft opening at the patio door in Dylan's vision looking out the door.The cinder blocks, wooden trash by the fence with 4-ft weeds and the trash trailer were NOT THERE, I repeat when I flew from Houston they were NOT THERE, when I rented the house and I would have NEVER rented the house if they were there.                        This is summer, but in the fall and winter the grass is gone and all you see is Jerry's trash.5-19, 2017 - I e-mailed Jerry several times when I rented this house I took many pictures and those piles of junk, cinder blocks and crap outside the back door and at the tree-line was not there remove them now. There was no response from QUEEN-of-PAIN . . . . Jerry.5-25, 2017 - QUEEN Jerry and Kim waited and stalked Dylan for hours in Jim McPeek's house again waiting for him to return from the dentist in Eugene. He pulled into the garage and walked in the back door and Jerry was pounding on the back patio door with a Pet Violation Notice – Remove the pet or the lease is terminated vacate by 6-5-2017. When Dylan got to the patio door and opened the glass door, Dylan told Jerry to step back just so he could open the screen door. Jerry did not move his face, so his disgusting face was within 2-foot of Dylan's face, as Jerry handed him the notice. Dylan told him to remove all this crap and trash from behind the patio, Jerry said ""Hell No.""Dylan watched as Jerry and Kim scurred back between the houses to Jim McPeek's house to rejoice with their old Communist California Comrades in their stalking combat operation. Jerry and Jim had to STALK DYLAN and wait for 14-day to catch Dylan leaving because he always shops at late at night. Why Jerry couldn't just come to the front door and give Dylan his notice on any day like anyone else or mail it, this only reflects his psychotic- derangement in dealing with his own personal issues in life.                          WE NOW THINK;  JERRY HAD COME TO THE BACKDOOR,  MANY TIMES BEFORE,                                 THIS IS PERVERSION VERY SICK EMOTIONALLY DISTURBING BEHAVIOR                                                                    JERRY'S CONTROL-FREAK POWER GAME!!!6-1-17 Meagan asked me about a check they got from their mortgage company. I told her it was from their escrow account and after they pay the insurance and taxes, they send you back the extra but she needed to call them to make sure. I told her they should put all or some of it in savings since it was extra money they weren’t expecting to get. That is when Meagan accidentally told me they had to use it to pay the attorney, then said oh never mind. I asked what they were paying him for and she told me Tim had been arrested last year for pot and meth possession and drug paraphernalia****** and they were still paying it off. I told her I had to go to the bathroom because I had to leave the room, I was SO UPSET! They had lied to me that he was better when they invited me to live with them, if I had known about this, I would never have moved in, I felt so ruthlessly betrayed. I pulled his police record and Tim had been arrested 3-times on many different charges, but the worse was the DUI, No Insurance, Pot, and meth in the car when he was arrested each time. This also means he was most assuredly driving illegally under the influence of drugs and he even had drugs with him with my granddaughters in the car!!6-8- 2017 - The 1st Attorney Letter to Stop Jerry's aggressive actions:The letter explained to Jerry he is not an attorney and he needs to consult with an attorney and to stop harassing us with is threats of eviction. For unlawful contract termination by Jerry & Kim Felgenhauer concerning the cat Jay and the additional $300, we paid an additional pet deposit FOR  a total cat deposit of $600. June 8, 20176-9-2017 This week was vacation bible school at Trinity Baptist Church, where Meagan and the girls go. That night when Tim got home from work, he found 4 nearly empty bottles of water in Tifa and Lily’s room and they are not supposed to hide food or water in their room so Tim took them into his bedroom and gave spankings to both. Since he rules this house I didn’t dare say anything for fear of the verbal abuse, I would get for it, which made me feel ashamed that I couldn’t stop it. The next day, Meagan called me and told me Tifa’s bible school teacher had taken Tifa to the bathroom and saw the bruises on her butt and legs and asked Tifa about it. Tifa told her, “My Daddy spanked me last night.” Meagan told me to feel out the teacher to see if they are going to call CPS because they can’t have another CPS case because of the last one 5 years ago with Lily.  Again, I was ashamed I did not call CPS about this, but living with Tim had made me fear his physical violent reactions, if I did call, I was in a VERY, VERY helpless situation!!!            My only happiness was talking everything out with Dylan he was my lifeline during this living hell. The teacher did not say anything to me, so CHURCHES, unlike schools, do not have to report abuse to CPS.6-11 -2017- Jerry's next Unlawful Notice of Lease Termination and his written personal threat to me as a woman, my person, and future security read his last line! Jerry rules-the-world and was already calculating his future retaliation against myself and Dylan in writing for the world to see. This is unmitigated arrogance and represents his harassing CALIFORNIA-COMMUNISTIC-EGOTISTICAL VIEW of the world and the people who have the terrible misfortune to know him.6-15- 2017 - The 2nd Attorney Letter to Stop Jerry's aggressive actions:Jerry called our Law Firm and tried to argue with our attorney he could evict us any time he wanted to!!!The letter further explained to Jerry he is not an attorney and he needs to consult with an attorney and to stop harassing us with is threats of eviction for unlawful contract termination.6-16-17 The 4th Hip pop-out:                                                                        I HAD BEEN CRYING IN MY PILLOW ALL NIGHT                              BECAUSE OF COMRADE JERRY - THE SCUMBAG FROM PASO ROBLES CALIFORNIA!!!   What could I do; if Jerry got in Dylan's face again Dylan would give him a NEEDED lesson in Texas Hospitality!At almost midnight I was sitting on the bed and bent over too fast to the right and my hip popped out again for the 4th time, it is Excruciating pain and I screamed for help. Tim came to the door of my room and screamed: “Shut the fuck up!” I told him to call 911 because my hip popped out again and he yelled at me again to “Shut the fuck up, tough it out, you’re a grown woman” with no sympathy for my pain at all.                  I begged him to give me my phone and he acted like he could not hear me for about 15 minutes.While I was in the hospital, Tim got on my computer (Stupid me, I have had the same password for years and Tim remembered it) and looked at my computer and saw my truck rental for Oregon in October and house listings Dylan had sent me . . . . .this sent Tim into a rage. I had told Tim and Meagan when I moved in that this was only temporary until I did rehab and got on my feet. Tim also broke into my cell phone because I don’t have it password protected and saw where Dylan was calling me and I was calling him. Dylan & I call one another every day 2-8 times and have for 18-years, nothing new. I have edited all of Dylan’s books, poems, and songs and business letters since we met and we ran several businesses. Tim called me at the hospital and threatened me over the phone “You pick either me or Dylan. If you pick him you will be out of my house by August 1st!” This is while I am lying in a hospital bed in pain from being put under anesthesia in a surgery room; waiting for an Orthopedic Dr. to put my hip back in place!                 THE PSYCHO SON FROM HELL!!!!This 4th pop-out was MUCH harder for me to get over as the orthopedic Dr. had a brace specially made for me to wear for 3 months for it to help keep my hip from popping out. You saw the terrible picture of me wearing the brace day and night 24/7.It is miserably hot in this 92-degree house in Texas heat, especially wearing it at night, while I am lying in bed, sweating, trying to get to sleep, and hoping the damn roaches leave me alone.                            MY FACE WAS SWOLLEN AND MY EYES WERE 2-FIREBALLS OF PAIN7-2- 2017 - Finally, got the Receipt for $300 cat deposit from Jerry. Jerry seems to have forgotten again when Dylan moved into the house Jerry was mowing the yard and was seeding the front yard and he was in control of the sprinkler in both 2016-17. Next, we only mow grass for 3-months in Oregon because it always raining, not for an entire year. It seems LYING in writing is Jerry's nature as. . . . .HE STATES HIS MENTALLY DISTORTED OPINION AS FACT AND COMMUNIST LAW. Jerry took complete control of the yard in 2016 and was again seeding the yard in 2017 and had complete control of the sprinkler system the entire 2-years of the contract. Dylan never touched the system, once.Now, Dylan desperately needs a second-foot operation to walk. He had bone spurs on both feet and they got much worse so he had to go through an operation all alone and his only friend in Oregon was Jim McPeek they had become friends when Dylan was unpacking. Dylan even talked with Karen and Jim the first month about maybe taking their boat to take some pictures of the ""Light Houses"" on the coast this was one of the reasons, I chose this location.Dylan was going to use a ""Light House Picture"" on the cover of the book, but you have to take a lot of pictures.         I feel like our lives have absolutely been sabotaged by these 4-EVIL people I WILL NEVER FORGIVE                                     Karen and Kim, they are best friends AT destroying/running other peoples lives. AS A WOMAN- I think Kim did find out about JERRY'S mindless obstinate, perverse sexual interest in me? I have a strong feeling it was these 2-sadistic-Women behind the screen, who were pulling the strings                                                        WITH THEIR CALIFORNIA COMRADES OF EVIL!!Jerry offered to install a medical handrail in the garage if I rented the house and he did. For anyone else, this would have been normal, but for Jerry, if he did something, he expected a big return on his effort, if you know him.I had no idea what kind of hell I was walking into, I just made a very bad and costly decision that has ruined our lives and our future lives!!!Kim lives alone, by herself in Eugene, not Windy Bay and/or in California and they have questioned our relationship. I seriously believe EVIL PEEPING-TOM JERRY plotted to get into my pants, what a fatal decision I made renting the house.                      The unrelenting argument for the 2-year contract made sense, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You have to understand I have been going to therapy and counseling every week for a year straight JUST TO LIVE, so you can go to rehab and you are so very thankful. I forget all the names there were so many, but it's the faces while you are crying and yelling, but Denise can you do just one more set of 10, maybe . . . . .I'll try.                         These are my heroes for the rest of my life because they gave me back my own life!7-9-2017 Tim, his wife, and girls got home from their 9-day vacation and Tifa accidentally kicked the cat’s water and Tim told her to get a towel to wipe up the water. Tifa 5 was not pressing the towel onto the water enough to soak any water up, so I laughed and told her to press the towel down harder to get up the water and Tim hollered at me “Old Lady, mind your own fucking business” which surprised me with the hatred he was saying that to his mother in front of his own daughter.7-11-2017 I was sitting on the edge of the bed in my room and the girls were in their room that is next to mine. They were arguing and when they do that I shush them to remind them to get along. Tim was coming to their room and screamed at me “Shut the fuck up and get your ass out of bed,” again with such hatred to his own mother and again in front of his 2 kids. 7-16-2017 Tim was angry after he and Meagan got home from buying groceries. Tim started demanding money from me, screaming at me after I told him I couldn’t give him any money for groceries until my social security gets here on 7-19 because I only have enough money in my account for 2 bills due this week. Tim told me I could take it out of my savings and I told him no, I would not. They had just gone on vacation and had spent too much, plus they have no savings despite making about $60,000 a year. Tim said it was because I was there and I told Tim that Meagan and the girls were out of school and were home all day eating more food. Tim got more and more upset and hollered at me, with the grand-kids standing there, “You are out of here as of now; you get the fuck out of my house! I don’t give a shit where the fuck you go but you are out of here this week!!  I told Tim, “I brought almost $500 worth of canned groceries when I moved in since I got here the end of March and I have spent almost $1200 on groceries and paying for ya’ll to eat out on .”Tim replied, “Fuck that, going out to eat was your choice and doesn’t count.” I just left and went to my room and stayed there, because I was afraid to be around him for fear his sadistic anger would boil over and his 6’4 and 250 lb. frame hurting me.  Luckily, I had already made myself a sandwich while they were gone to the store because I was not called when supper was ready and they ate without me, with no thought whether I was eating or not. I was not going to come out of my room for fear of Tim not only screaming at me but escalating it into physical violence.7-17-2017 The next morning Meagan allowed me to eat some cereal after I came out of my room at 11:30 am after Tim went to work so he can’t scream at me, then I went back into my bedroom. Meagan came to my doorway and demanded, “What did you say to my kids about yesterday?” I told her I had only told them “Grandmother is moving out but always remember that grandmother loves you both,” that was all. She got furious and yelled at me “Do not to speak to my kids again until you get moved out!” Then Meagan screamed at the girls, “You can no longer speak to your fucking grandmother or help her ass at all or Dad and I will whip your butts!” I have no friends or relatives in Big Spring and had no idea of what I needed to do to get out of their house on such short notice. I was so upset about everything I cried all that day trying to figure out what to do.  Dylan went online and called churches in Big Spring but was told they had no resources or funds to help. I then saw the Canterbury Apartments was for low income elderly. The ad said it was run by St. Mary’s Episcopal so I called them but they said they were not affiliated anymore, but the lady told me to call West Texas Centers. I called them explaining my situation to the operator and she told me she thought she knew someone there who might be able to help me and she would have him call me. This was the call I received from the man I now call my saving Angel, Gary Tidwell, a counselor there.I explained what had happened to me and he told me he would make an appointment with the Victim Services Center for tomorrow because this was an adult and elder abuse and I needed to talk to APS Adult Protective Services about this. Tim and Meagan again offered me nothing to eat during the day when they ate lunch or later when they ate supper. I did not go into the rest of the house because I avoided Tim at all costs so he can’t start screaming and cussing at me and I am scared of Tim NOW. I had no food all the rest of the day except when some of their friends came over and they went outside with them. I got a can of Progresso soup, it was one of the many cans of food I had brought along with other foodstuffs, when I moved in. I opened the flip top can and ate the soup cold with a spoon in my room. Later that night Tim and his wife got into a big fight in their room with their door open for over an hour shouting and cussing at one another.  This was not the first time they had argued, there were probably at least 3 or 4 a month since I moved in. This wasn’t the first time I was in my bedroom scared, with my phone on my chest, ready to call 911 in case he came into my room to take his anger out on me. Dylan and I talked while the screaming went on for hours, it had to be they were both on meth. and instead of having hour long sex escapades they decided to out-scream each other!!!!7-18-2017 - Meagan allowed me to eat some cereal and I went back into my room to stay out of the way in case Tim was there and had not gone to work yet. Gary came by at 9:30 and took me in his van to see Lynn at Victim Services. I described the emotional and verbal abuse that had gone on and she gave me a list of safe houses in Midland to contact for a place to live for a few months. She also gave me an application for the Canterbury Apartments to help me get on my feet then I can work later on in September at schools. Gary was with me for 2 hours and then took me back to Tim’s house but promised me he would get me out of there soon. Lynn came back later to Tim’s house after I filled out the application and faxed it to the Canterbury for me.I got back into my bedroom and here came Meagan into the doorway and shouted at me “What have you been doing?” because I had told her I was going to talk to APS Adult Protective Services. She screamed at me, “If you get APS involved they would take the kids away AGAIN because of our CPS case years ago with Lily and it would ruin Tim since he had only a month left on his probation! ""You have been a shitty fucking mother to my husband, you chose dick before your child and I would never desert my kids like you did Tim.” I told her “Tim has caused so many things to happen to himself despite all my love and efforts and it was hard to reason with someone who was full of so much hate” but Meagan would not listen to anything, just like her husband Tim, everything was all my fault and they had no problems. I told her “I would not talk to APS only because I did not want to hurt my grandkids, not because of you or Tim.” She said “What a fucking surprise, you finally acting like a mom” and I told her, “No, I have always been there for Tim as his mom but now I am acting like a loving grandmother.” She then told me “You need to get a hotel tonight and the rest of the fucking week,” so I told her “I put in an application for the Canterbury Apartments and I should know something by Friday” (just so I could stay in their house despite how bad it was, until Gary could get me to a safe house.) I still could not drive my car to leave and I absolutely, positively would have gotten out if I could have driven. The Child Protection Service had already taken Lilly away from Meagan and Tim for over a year because bruises were found on her legs and butt. Meagan was just worried about Tim and showed she could care less about her own daughters. 1.     MEAGAN HAS DOCUMENTED AND PROVEN TO BE A TERRIBLE MOTHER TO BOTH OF HER CHILDREN AND HAS CAUSED MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA TO EACH OF MY GRANDDAUGHTERS!2.     AS A TEACHER; I SERIOUS QUESTION HER DEMONSTRATED PROFESSIONAL INEPT TEACHING ABILITY!Again they offered me nothing to eat during the day when they ate lunch or later when they ate supper. I did not go into the rest of the house because I avoided Tim so he can’t start screaming and cussing at me as I am scared to death of him now. I had no food all the rest of the day except after Tim went to work and Meagan went to sleep when I snuck into the kitchen an got 2 slices of American cheese and a handful of cheese puffs, that was it. 7-19-2017Once more I waited until Tim went to work and Meagan allowed me to eat some cereal. I went back to my room  I had a list of safe houses in Lubbock, Abilene, Odessa, and Midland to contact about staying there because Gary knew it was not safe for me to stay in Big Springs, it was too close to being accosted by Tim. Living in a safe house would get me out of this situation, to help me get back on my feet and then I can sub teach. I started calling the places to see if they would take me I decided on a domestic shelter in Midland and set it up to go on Saturday which they would hold for 3 days. They don’t give you the address, you go to the police department parking lot and they come and take you there. You get to take 7 changes of clothes and your toiletries. Tim came home from work and announced in the kitchen loud enough so I could hear in my room that I was not allowed to have any more of their bottled water. Now I would have to drink the Big Spring tap water, which is undrinkable but when you can’t drive and it was too far to walk to the store, you have to fill up your empty water bottle with yucky tap water. Late,r that night I posted this on my Facebook: ""Going thru a rough patch, please send prayers! Love ya."" Meagan came to my door and went ballistic screaming, “What the fuck are you doing posting our business on Facebook? My kids are upset, they want to know why their Dad is so sad” and other rants I blocked out.  I told her, “I didn’t say anything about what is happening, I just asked for prayers. Posting your business would be telling everyone what you and your husband are doing to me so leave me alone!”Later Tim posted this hateful comment from his Facebook name Thor Fancher (he thinks he’s a fantasy hero THOR) on my Facebook: “Fuck you did this she doesn't need any prayers.” Once again, I was not invited to eat lunch or supper so I snuck into the kitchen and got one of the Nutrisystem dinners I had brought when I moved there, which I opened and ate cold in my room. Later Tim blasted music in his room so loud at 11:30 pm. I can’t close my door at night because Tim thinks my little ac cools some of the house and he gets mad if I close it so I lay awake because of his music until 3 am when he finally turned it off, and I was able to sleep. As I laid there I knew Tifa and Lilly were also being overwhelmed with this horrible dreadful music of death and violence. Their poor little lives are being destroyed by these meth freaks.You must understand a lot of Dylan and my feelings and thoughts are NOT listed here, they are already in the BOOK! Just talking and writing in the book was my only mental escape.7-20-2017 REMEMBER, I CAN NOT DRIVE OR WALK WITHOUT A WALKER  -   They ran out of cereal so I got no breakfast. Tim went to work and Meagan took Tifa and Lily to her grandparents so Tifa could stay with them for a week. I ate 2 protein bars I had brought with me when I moved in. Gary came over at 3 pm and we got our plan together to move me out on Saturday 7-22. He has wonderful Boy Scout friends that will help me move out my stuff to a storage unit I rented. Before Tim and Meagan came home, I got another Nutrisystem meal and a jar of almost empty peanut butter to eat later that I knew they wouldn’t miss. Meagan got home and came to my door and asked me about moving out and I told her they were coming on Saturday at 1 pm to move me out. She did not say a word: she just left and again did not call me for supper so I ate my Nutrisystem cold again. Tim got home later and turned on his music at 10:30 pm but I shut my door and locked it because at this point if he tries to get in my door I will call 911 for the police but thankfully for me, he didn’t. Since he left me alone this was probably the best night’s sleep I had in a long time knowing I would soon be away from their hatred and abuse.7-21-2017Tim and Meagan and the kids were gone when I woke up at 9 am so I got another one of my protein bars for breakfast. Rhea my Physical Therapist came at 10 am and saw my bottle of water was almost empty and asked if she could get me another one out of the fridge. I told her she would have to fill it from the faucet in the bathroom. She was appalled and told me I wasn’t supposed to drink Big Spring water and I told her that was all I had to drink since 7-19 and not much food. After we did my physical therapy she went to the store with my debit card and got me a 24 pack of bottled water and some sandwiches.7-22-2017  - I escaped from my prison camp and was taken by a Woman's Protective Shelter, but this was just another stopping place until my doctor found a rehab Hospital Center, where I stayed for several months.I got up and went into the living room around 10 am after Tim and Meagan got up and reminded them that Gary and his friends were coming at 1 to move me out. Tim went ballistic because he was going to take Lily to a movie but now he couldn’t because he had to be there when they came. He screamed and hollered at me and I told him to be pissed at his wife because I had told her what time I was moving out on Thursday and turned around and went to my room. I texted Gary that Tim was screaming at me at the house, so to be careful when he came and Gary replied don’t worry we will just call the police if we need to.When Gary and his friends came over to move my property out of the bedroom I was so embarrassed when they lifted up my Queen box springs and roaches went everywhere all over the floor and up the walls. It was so gross for them to see how I had been forced to live plus they couldn’t imagine how I had stood to live in the awful heat either. Gary’s friend had a truck and a trailer and there were 5 other people so the move went pretty fast. I got all my stuff into storage but I was not able to drive my car so Gary said he would drive me to the Safe House and his wife would follow and take him home. Gary and his wife took me out to eat Mexican food since it had been a week since I had eaten a good meal then we took off to Midland, away from the horrible abuse I suffered at the hands of Tim and Meagan, but away from my 2 beautiful granddaughters. I now constantly worry about I am not allowed to call or see any more.Again, thank you so much for rescuing me from HELL!8-6-2017To:       Gary Tidwell                                                                                                                                                                                  432-213-2321             cell 432-466-4950 wk.District Attorney Office           Thad Thomas – Investigator                                                                                                                                                          432-264-2220          thad.thomas@howardcountytx.comFm:      Dylan                                                                                                                                                                       PO Box 1324                                                                                                                                                                      Winchester Bay, Oregon 97467Re:       The Parenting, Supervision, Education and Nurturing ability of Tim and Meagan Fancher, Big Springs, Tx Hello Gary,I am Dylan. Thank you so much for your immediate assistance in helping Denise out of that life-threatening situation with her psychopathic son and merciless companion Meagan. I want to go the record; as the person starting this investigation because we would fear for Denise personally otherwise and it is better for the kids to think it was I and not their grandmother.I will tell you having been on the other end of the phone listening to the endless screaming through this terrible ordeal from Tim’s insane behavior day and night with Denise and not knowing how to help has been the worse part. For many years Denise and I have discussed this escalating environmental trauma induced situations with Lily and Tifa; as they both struggle to develop psychologically with their two juvenile escapists from life parents with their incapability for the parental responsibility to ensure the safety, well-being and growth of their own children! We discussed Child Protective Services many times and how we would proceed as we agreed we had to do what was best for the future of the 2-girls. Then, Tim broke into Denise’s computer and phone to get my cell number to see who Denise was calling and left several vulgar messages on my phone, not included here. I will say, Tim never had the courage to call and talk to me on the phone personally because the only courage he has is beating his children, threatening, yelling and cussing at his mother and having rough sex with Meagan as they each screamed and spanked each other for hours, bombed on vodka and meth with the music blasting at 2 am. Yea, I heard all this on the phone as Denise and I tried to figure out how to get her out of this terrible situation, but she could not drive, walk or even fly away from this  LIVING  HELL! This was not the first time Tim and Meagan had performed their screaming sexual acts so loud, just so Denise could hear and not sleep.We have seen the heinous, sadistic, emotional complexes, anger fixations topped with an authority rebellion from both Tim and Meagan, but we do agree neither person has demonstrated for many years, they could adequately provide a stable and harmonious environment to nurture Lily and Tifa to grow, advance and develop as normal children! Dylan8-12-2017  I was finally in an Adult Protective Program and finally got the right physical therapy every day and counseling because this had been a very hard year.9-22-2017  Dylan is completely all alone in Oregon, but has his right foot operated on for a bone spur at the Umpqua Hospital, in Reedsport, OR 2-miles away from the house, but also desperately needs an operation on his left foot. Lower Umpqua Hospital District                                                                                                                                                                                      600 Ranch Rd                 Reedsport, OR 97467He has great difficulty just walking in the house this is why he only leave the house 3-4 times a month just to get groceries, no HELP and no fun for Dylan.                                                                   Dr. Bennett’s Appointment after Surgery EventMonday, September 25, 2017, my 67th birthday:Well, today I became 67 years old and I thought about going to a restaurant.  The problem is because of this surgery I have lost 5-days in completing the formatting of my book “theEthics” of Honorable Intelligence to go to the publishers ASAP.My left arm was really burning, so I just rubbed it, as I sat patiently waiting for Dr. Bennett to come in and examine my foot. I had kept it up on my desk as I worked on my book all weekend, so there was no swelling, great, so he put a new dressing on my foot. I told him, “With that done let’s talk about what happened in the operating room, so maybe you want to close the door,” and he did. Dr. Bennett said, “What happened in the operating room?” I stated, “I saw you in the room when I told everyone about my nerve injury.” Dr. Bennett said, “Oh, when the nurse touched your arm.” After all that had happened, for Dr. Bennett to responds so smug and even arrogant like he had a professional debilitation called “Selective Doctor Memory” was to be expected. I asked him, “Why did you not come in and address what happened after surgery or even now”, as I gave him the opportunity, because he had not given it any thought?I told him, “Putting pressure on my arm was like putting a cattle prod up against cattle, they yell because it is extremely painful.” Although Dr. Bennett did have a blank look on his face, he also had a smirk and when I saw that I stated, “Take that smirk off your face, this is no game.” Dr. Bennett then said, “I did not know the extent of your disability, was it in my records?” For any Doctor to say, HE DID NOT KNOW the extent of a patient’s disability, after he had performed an operation on this patient, was immorally unprofessional. The truth is Dr. Bennett did not even look at my medical history or every previous doctor report. Further, Dr. Stephanie Casey had done a  pre-operation physical where she documented the decreased range of motion in both arms.     This means Dr. Bennett did not even look at my Pre-operation Physical before he operated on myself!!!                                                             THIS WAS CRIMINALLY and MORALLY UNETHICALI reiterated what had actually happened as stated above and he kept quiet, politely asking to speak and I abruptly stated NO, 3-different times because he was too calm and would sincerely deliver an endless barrage of narcissistic reasons, why he was always harmless, blameless and irresponsible. Dr. Bennett, I do apologize for the passion in my delivery, but when you stated the nurse had just touched my arm, the pain in my arm said, “Wait a minute Doctor; let me tell you about a lifetime of pain and survival from a front row seat.” I stated to Dr. Bennett, as I was leaving, “I will have someone else take out my stitches and I did.”After that loud exchange the women in the office had just watched, as I used the 2-crutches to walk down the hall and with no one else in the office, they stood and watched me struggle to open the door against the wind. I got the door open and used my crutch as a prop, but when I moved the other crutch, the force almost knocked me down.   So I had to YELL, “Could one of you women come and hold the door open please?”I had found this same type of ""Blameless Responsibility"" in Winchester Bay and Reedsport, but for DOCTORS this is scandalous, unlawful and unethically immoral.I went home and did some research on the Lower Umpqua Hospital and Dr. Bennett before calling Mr. Fowler at the hospital and leaving a message. 9-26-17 When I spoke with Mr. Fowler with the Lower Umpqua Hospital District. I stated that I had a serious malpractice complaint against the hospital staff in the operating room where I had surgery on 9-22-17. Mr. Fowler and I discussed a time to discuss this and I suggest today 9-29-17 at 1 pm. Mr. Fowler said, “Any time on Friday, my schedule is open.” I said, “This will give you enough time to get a written statement from each one involved. I was a GM for many years and just want to fix this problem, so it does not happen to another Veteran or a disabled person.”My personal reasons were: I did not want anyone fired, just disability training, awareness, and conscientious documentation because humanitarian skills like kindness and compassion seemed to be vacant in this hospital.Finally, Mr. Fowler did brag to me he had a Masters in Administration. I might suggest in choosing your next CAO demand he has a medical background, first with administration training because a hospital needs a compassionate leader for Human Suffering, not an accountant who calculates his denial of responsibility with exuberance.I ALWAYS make each person aware of my injury because they can never stick-a-needle or take blood or blood pressure on my left-arm, Never!9-26-2017To:       Lower Umpqua Hospital District                                                                                                   The Board of Directors                                                                                                                                     Ron Kreskey – President                                                                                                                      600 Ranch Rd                 Reedsport, OR 97467Fm:      Dylan - USMC Retired Sgt.                                                                                                                                                 PO Box 1324                                                                                                                                                              Winchester Bay, OR 97467                                                                                                                                                                                                   Re:       1.         September 22, 2017 - Operational procedures at the Lower Umpqua Hospital on Dale Stephens                    2.         Urgent need for patient disability information to be:                                    a. entered into their records and b. updated especially, before an operation                                                                                3.         Staff and Doctors need professional counseling because no one reported this malpractice event                                                                           before  I talked to Mr. Fowler 3-days later, which was almost criminal             4.          “Patient Empathy Training” is a kind voice, a gentle hand and a genuine smile of compassionSirs,I had the ill-fated event of having my foot surgery at the Lower Umpqua Hospital on September 22, 2017.I have been disabled since 1970 with a stretch brachial radiolus nerve injury having little use of my left arm. To this day there are fiery-nerves and numb places up and down the arm. So, for 47-years I have been alertly proactive in reminding every medical assistant who touches my body of my disability injury. Since 2003: I’ve had 2-foot, 2-back, and 1-knee surgery, so I am familiar with interacting with all types of staff, x-ray, rehab, and nurses. The main question I would ask, “Is my disability information documented in my records?” The answer is NO or I will correct it or was that my Right arm or my Left arm or was it a temporary injury or it's disabled, that’s all.The left arm vein collapses and the bicep muscle is so weak it cannot even pick up 5-lbs. so it cannot resist the blood pressure cup because this forces the hot nerves to be pushed together and they respond with electric-fire, much like touching a very hot plate; this is a level-10++ in pain. When I checked in with Courtney at the hospital, she wanted to get my blood pressure and take some blood, so I again explained the situation, this was not to be done on the left arm but she said nothing because there was nothing in my Medical Records. This is all I know, as the patient asking questions, that people cannot answer.I would like to say, if the statement, “the Left Arm is Disabled,” with a brief description of the injury and care should be taken with my vital signs, where it absolutely should be, right next to “I’m allergic to penicillin” or it is somewhere LOST in the back of my extensive file, it’s no wonder, no one sees it or even takes the time to read the file. It’s not my responsibility to resolve this failure in communications. It’s the Board of Directors, who own the responsibility to secure and protect the health and well-being of each patient, who entrust their lives under their responsible authority.I have not found “this deficiency of Veteran Disability Information documentation” or employee’s with such nonchalant attitudes ever before, as I have had surgeries and years of rehab in Washington, Phoenix, Amarillo and Houston.  The Events of the Malpractice Operation at the Umpqua Hospital on September 22, 2017:As I was rolled into the operation room, I stated, “I was always asleep in deep-anesthesia surgeries before I got in there, this room’s very cold” as they helped me onto the operating table. Of course, every patient is anxious and even worried because every operation is as serious as life gets. I was in good spirits and talked with the anesthesiologist as the other people were coming into the room. I saw Dr. Bennett over by the door after they closed it as they hooked me up to the machines and strapped me down. A nurse grabbed my left arm and I told her “everything you do must go through my right arm.”I explained out loud, with the anesthesiologist right by my head, about the stretch Brachioradialis Nerve injury and having little use of my left arm for 47-years. It was loud enough that every person heard what I said, in this in a1-room operating room EVERYONE could hear me, remember I'm a contractor the room was 20x20 feet.I could see everyone was coming over to the table and the anesthesiologist was telling me about the drugs and he was getting ready to place the face-tubes over my head, when the SAME nurse grabbed my left arm and put the blood pressure cup on my arm again.           THANK GOD I WAS ABLE TO STOP HER, AS I FELT THE PRESSURE AND BURNING PAIN IN MY ARM!TO THE 2-IRRESPONSIBLE BOY-DOCTORS:  HAD THE NURSE DONE THIS AFTER I WAS UNCONSCIOUS, I WOULD SAY MY CHANCES OF BEING FURTHER DISABLED FROM THIS IRRESPONSIBLE NURSE/EVENT AND WITH GREATER PAIN WOULD BE ABOUT 100% CHANCE !! THIS WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY, EXACERBATED MY DISABILITY WITH EVEN MORE HOPELESSNESS FOR MY LEFT ARM TO FUNCTION at 66 years old!I was watching everyone off to my right and she got the pressure cup on my left arm with about 2 or 3-squeezes off, before I stated in a loud and painful voice, “Stop, take that off right now!” The nurse froze with the cup pressurized against my nerves and the fire was unbelievably painful. My right arm has always intuitively, instantly protected my left arm and I made a move to tear the pressure cup off. I mentally stopped that action and stated again YELLED, “Take the thing off, now!” I make no waivers for my tone, my attitude or anger exhibited I WAS LOUD in a room the size of a 2-car garage IT MUST HAVE ECHOED.Then, a nurse came over, stood over me on my right side and uttered, “Calm down.” I declared, “I just explained to the whole room about my left arm disability, weren’t you listening?” She said, “We did not know about your disability.” I stated “A disability is a disability! I’m not going to argue with you over semantics!” That woman was as heartless as the sterile room; her demeanor was argumentative and not empathetic as she argued with me more. I did a quick body inventory and decided, I was extremely stressed out, there was fiery pain in my left arm, my heart was beating faster and I decided, I was canceling the operation right now because it would be dangerous, as I was arguing with the nurses because I was now sweating in the cold room, I was so upset quarreling with these 2-nurses before my operation AS I LAY ON THE OPERATING TABLE!!!. NO Doctor, came over to the gurney to take charge or even to say, “It’s Ok Mr. everything is going to be alright!” Dr. Bennett was standing just FROZEN, a helpless human  Manikin just watching in the room along with the anesthesiologist Doctor, sitting 3-feet behind me and both IRRESPONSIBLE DOCTORS should be banned from surgery for LIFE!!!!!NO ONE was in charge or took charge of the room; a man’s silence is just that, taking ZERO,  NO responsibility. I was strapped down and felt all alone in a room with all these people in masks just watching me.Then, with no warning or “Please count down from 100,” the anesthesiologist turned on the drug and I was under. I had the feeling I had screwed up his golf-tee time, so let’s get this thing over, how dare I. This was just a day surgery, no big thing, right, its just like heating up a TV dinner.Dr. Bennett came in and waved at me maybe he said something in the recovery room. Of course, I was very upset when I awoke all alone and my left arm was itchy and burning. When I got home I tried to relax and get comfortable, so I could reflect on what had just happened to me. I contemplated and by Sunday evening I had decided to ask Dr. Bennett for his version because he had a bird’s eye view plus, he was the damn DOCTOR  in-charge of the operating room.9-29-2017Friday 11:15 am  I called Mr. Fowler today at 11 am because we had a meeting scheduled for today at 1 pm.I stated, “The weather is rainy outside and I still have stitches in my foot, it’s been a week now and I’m still, on crutches. I’m an art collector; I live in Winchester Bay a couple of miles away. I have a very lovely living room, where we can sit without disturbance, and the meeting should take about 15 minutes.”Mr. Fowler stated, “We can meet next week sometime.” I stated, “I’m going to resolve this issue today did you interview your staff? Mr. Fowler said, “Yes” that was all he said. I waited and then stated, “Unfortunately, they did not tell you the truth by your reflective attitude.” Mr. Fowler stated, “You have broken the meeting, not I.” I stated, “I have offered an alternative meeting because I’m on crutches and it’s raining outside.” Mr. Fowler stated, “Meeting at your house is impossible, as I have plans for later.”I stated, “You have not even seen my document, yet.” Mr. Fowler said, “You can just tell me over the phone or send it to my e-mail.” I stated, “I gave you, a businessman offer, to discuss the malpractice in your hospital.” Fowler continues his confrontational talk, as we are now talking over each other, as Mr. Fowler keeps reiterating, “You have broken the meeting, not I.” I stated, “I have a 4-page document you have not seen, I only do business face to face.”Like an old record, Mr. Fowler again kept stating, “You have broken the meeting, not I.” I stated, “The reason I contacted you was I want to have a  meeting, before I went public and to the Board of Directors.” I stated emphatically to Fowler “This is the same kind of nonchalant, detached irresponsible attitude exhibited in the Operating Room by your Staff and the Doctors. I’m going to make a decision today to discuss the incompetence in your Hospital or I will send my report already addressed to the Board of Directors, the Portland Times.” I stated, “Mr. Fowler to you understand what I just stated?”Mr. Ryan Fowler in his professional eloquence stated “Mr. Stephens you do, what you have to do.”As you can see from our conversation; I tried to explain to Mr. Fowler, this was not funny or a joke. Fowler never did hear my malpractice complaint, he found rudeness and indifference more reward as he continued talking over me, arguing over the meeting he did not want to attend. The consequences of his superciliousness behavior, today is going to be shared by a lot of people.Fowler exhibited his self-admiring hospital demeanor, using a dismissive condescending approach by dominating the conversation and talking over me, which represented his reckless style of dealing with critical complaints against his authority, how dare I make a grievance complaint!I believe Fowler is a young, inexperienced, somewhat naïve man in a professional position, who lacks the empathy to perceive the ramifications of his owns incompetent decisions. Hiring a man who is a friend of the Ron Kreskey – President has put this Hospital and Reedsport in the news. This is a very dangerous philosophy to operate a Hospital, with an impending life and death situation, which can occur at any time. I suggested in our first conversation for a written statement from each of the staff to Fowler. I surmised, if Fowler did interview any of the staff he did not ask for written statements or even talked to the Doctors, if he did it was like a participant observer meaning; he had a pre-selected outcome and was he culpable in any employee fabrications to fit the story-line?A professional investigation will confirm my testimony of the events in the operating room, which was always my primary concern.  The Doctors and Mr. Fowler each carry the accountability of this event because neither did they accept their responsibility nor endeavored to reach out to Dylan as the patient, who entrusted his body and soul to the trustworthy patient care of the Lower Umpqua Hospital's CLOWN MENTALITY.                              There was no documentation on my wristband about a Left-Arm disability? I ask the Board of Directors one question: I have my penicillin allergy on my wristband, but NOT A WORD about my Left-Arm disability. How long has his been the dangerous practice of this unsupervised Hospital Administration? If an emergency occurred in an operation, not know about a patients disability would be extremely dangerous. What if they were missing a lung, kidney, half of their brain or a visible disability like mine is not easily recognizable like a missing leg or arm, and should this LIFE information be documented next to blood type, get with LIFE!!?Do you understand the documentation of the introduction now? Urgent need for patient disability information to be:                        a. entered into their records                        b. updated especially, before an operation                       c. the anesthesiologist Doctor did not even know, I was disabled !!!!   I wonder how he did on the Golf                               Couse and can you imagine his professional deflection of responsibility over a martini in the                                               clubhouse?    Can not wait to find out his name!!!!!!                                                                              This hospital must become offensive in this preventable collapse, of the administration of “Patient Well-Being.”This is not just a Veterans or a DAV issue, this problem is the accurate documentation of ALL Disabilities.If Mr. Fowler had made a genuine attempt, to use his learned diplomatic negotiating skills to sympathize with a heartfelt, patient complaint and then to look for solutions, this exacerbated situation would have ended much differently.During this operation there was a terrible injustice committed against Dylan, now Fowler has waved his hand and the incident is wash away with a sip of wine at dinner tonight.NO person affiliated with the Reedsport Umpqua Hospital ever took my statement so of course they never interviewed any person and the issue is closed. I'm sure Ron and Ryan thought they had silence my voice and had won!     10-2-2017 - I called my own physician Dr. Stephanie Casey at the Dunes Family Health Care Clinic next to the Umpqua Hospital. I explained in complete detail my experience in the operating room, my letter to Ron and dealing with Fowler and my pain and emotion were on display. After about 15 minutes of talking, I said what do you think of this?Dr. Stephanie Casey said ""What do you want me to do? I said, ""How about some compassion for your own patient? I said, ""You gave me my pre-operation physical and you documented the lack of range-of-motion in my left and right arms."" Dr. Stephanie Casey said, ""I have nothing to do with the hospital, but I will look at your documents. I said, Dr. Casey, it would be a waste of your time and mine, I think you need to go and re-read you hypo-critic-loath to your patients. I'm not going to send you any documents have a good day, goodbye."" I felt very sorry for Casey as she had failed to live up to the title, she hides behind.I never heard from her or anyone at the Dunes Family Health Care Clinic. OK, what would you do now, and  I still desperately need a 2nd foot operation?                  THE PEOPLE OF REEDSPORT NEED TO DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF THESE UNETHICAL AND                                                              DISGRACEFUL MEN  & WOMEN DAMAGING THE GOOD NAME OF                                                                                   THE HOSPITAL & CLINIC, NOW!     10-29-2017         Of course, this was the end of their investigation because their office is in Portland 200-miles away and no one was killed.

Denise now becomes part of a Class Action Lawsuit against the manufacturer.I made sure I documented Jerry's extreme EVIL persecution into our lives and he was the instrument factor forcing my recovery and each displacement of my hip, I was driven to try harder to get well by the endless stress from Jerry and Kim.Kim is just as immorally heartless as Jerry and she deserves all the blame as the silent-scheming-partner in ALL of Jerrys evil schemes of GOD-HATRED.You can see the titanium screws in the top of the ball and you can see the wire he wrapped around the thigh bone, I feel like an old car. This was the MOST PAINFUL of the prior 4-surgeries and my mental wellness is not good, I have been worrying about Jerry & Kims next invasion into our lives, but Dylan is very3-28-2018 - Jerry e-mailed me he raised the rent $100Jerry wanted us to buy his house or put us on a month-to-month and then he could raise the rent for any reason or decided to charge us with other revenue ideas. We declined and gave a 30-day notice to move by 7-1-2018.3-30-2018  - Dr. Jordan Simmons Letter to Jerry explaining the surgeries and rehab I have been through and the medical request and need for a quiet and peaceful environment in the house. It took 1.5 months to finally get the Doctors Letter. We decided it was time to get other people involved in resolving this human obstinate.4-14 –2018 - Through all this endless emotional stress, surgeries, rehab and pain of our physical lives we formatted and published our 3rd book “theEthics” of Honorable Intelligence Poetry & Songbook; as an eBook on Kindle. This is an unbelievable International book where you enter the world and exciting life of Dylan and his unbelievable creative mind. My goal was for him to record his 7th album in Oregon, but Jerry made this a total impossibility as Dylan was spied on for 2-years, which made the idea of recording a new song or album terribly impossible.This is what we work for; Dylan writes and I edit and help focus his incredible books as we both have a great passion to create and write, this is what kept us together and positive for the future !!!!! Dylan was re-writing many poems and songs for the paperback edition maybe this year and this diverted any angry energy we had into joyful creativity, then reality says remember heartless Jerry!3rd Attorney Letter4-27-2018- 3rd Attorney Letter to  Jerry to stop harassing both Dylan and me it was just like the previous letters5-10-18 Text from Denise to Jerry about why are you raising the rent $1005-10-2018-  Doing some ""Discovery Work"" I texted Jerry and stated,  ""the house had been vacant for 2-years before I rented the house and we have never been late on a payment we gave you $24,206 why are you raising the rent?"" Jerry texted me “YES, I do own the house so want to raise the rent $100 a mo for a return on my investment and do you want to buy it.”                                                                                              THIS WAS THE SMOKING GUN!!! THIS WAS COMRADE JERRY & KIM'S PLAN FROM THE DAY THEY WALKED INTO THE HOUSE AND SAW THE FURNISHING, MUSH GRANDER THAN THERE, WHITE WALL OF NOTHINGNESS!!5-12-18 When we receive this last text message we understand some of Jerry's forceful harassment, he thought he could harass us into buying his house because of the terrible health-condition we were both experiencing. The letter dated 3-30-2018 from Dr. Simpson below states Denise's medical condition and ask for Jerry to understand the situation and to leave us alone.As Realtors we had checked the MLS and Zillow on the property interesting it was valued at $145K in May 2016, but in  April 2018  this house at 1050 Broadway Ave, Winchester Bay, OR 97467 3 beds 2 baths 1,512 sqftJERRY HAD IT FOR SALE -$255KNeighborhood: 97467MEDIAN ZESTIMATE $173,500 up 11.8 %Past 12 monthsZillow predicts among 97467 homes, this home is 49.2% more expensive than the midpoint (median) home, and is priced 40.5% more per square foot. The Broker at Pacific West Realty, Inc and agent Alex Emmons who listed this house must have been rookie's no seasoned Agent would list a house at 40% more than market price in such a small market as Winchester Bay or had Jerry cut some other mysterious business deal with the Broker and Agent?When Jerry came into the house 6-weeks after Dylan had hung all the paintings and the house looked beautiful when Jerry looked at his Marine Uniform, Dylan unknowingly asked if Jerry was in the military, Jerry never answered he just walked away. This has really puzzled us since that very day, this is not how an honorable good American would behave, something was terribly, morally wrong with JERRY! 5-18-2018 -     Jerry's Final Eviction Notice - he made positive sure Sgt. Dylan received this Anti-American                                    ANTI-MARINE harassment notice on 5-26-18 just before celebrating Veterans Day. 5-18-2018    Letter given to Jim & Karen McPeek,Jim just between you and I when I met you I thought you were a man of integrity and were honorable. Jim in this world a person is judged by his friends and your Machiavellian treachery and a very bad judge of character represent guilt through association this is what your great friends have done for you.In the 2-years I have lived in this house we have had to send 4- letters from our attorneys and 1-letter from Denise’s Doctor to restrain the mental, physical abuse and persecution from Jerry and Kim Felgenhauer. Maybe you 2-adults need to get copies of the attorney and doctor letters. Next, get “The Legal Discovery” text messages from Jerry and Kim we documented into our case for our attorneys during these past 2-years, so your attorney will have them ahead of time FYI.  If Jerry and Kim will not give them to you, this will be costly legal trouble for you.Jim McPeek, you have colluded for 2-years from your house; as a legal conspirator to all of Jerry and Kim Felgenhauer unlawful encroachments and your shared personal liabilities of harm against our good name and civil liberties. As my only neighbor and the only other person, we knew in Oregon to spy on my life was very unscrupulous and to not be a friend to a new neighbor, only exemplifies your own personal enjoyment and further dishonor as a human being.Right after I finished the unpacking of our home I invited Jerry, Kim, and you and Karen to see the house with all the Chinese paintings, rugs and statues unpacked; the house was amazing and beautiful as every wall was covered in original oil, pastel, watercolor, charcoal with lots of antique art. Our attorneys in the law firm, could not figure out, why Jerry would harass a person who had never been late on rent!As a historian and collector of only Chinese and Japanese art, we finally realized Kim is Korean and the Chinese and Koreans have endured centuries of cultural hatred and prejudice. Kim has stated in a text, that she did not even know not a Chinese or Japanese person!                                                                                  IT TOOK US AWHILE TO FINALLY FIGURE OUT                                                                                                              THE BEGINNING OF                                                          THE COMMUNIST-CALIFORNIA OREGON VENGEFUL HATREDSo, of course within days...... Jerry started heaping his trash trailers, piles of cinder-blocks under the patio, with a large wooden form with 3-foot grass growing around the trash now and then he pulled his street dragger out by the street, so I would have to look at his trash every time DYLAN looked or walked out on the patio or front door and for anyone else to see. I complained to Jerry because my home is elegant, beautiful and I’m a writer. Jerry piled more of his trash invisible site of the front and patio doors forcing Dylan again, to ALWAYS KEEP the blinds shutting the only patio door window were the only sunlight could entire house, so I would not look at a beautiful forest with Jerry’s trash right out the windows, but this is why Jerry intentionally transported his trash there Jim, YOUR GOOD BUDDY.Jerry was looking in the windows 5-months before Denise popped her hip out 1st time in 12-2016. Jerry had to walk up on the porch and pull the screen back to look into the patio door during the day just to see Jay the cat and at night this advances to a second-degree misdemeanor. Next, since only half of the patio door gets sunlight how many times did Jerry have to look in the patio door to catch Jay laying in the sun?1.         The first illegal Notice Jerry delivered in person.First, Jim how did Jerry know I had left my house he lives miles away? The day Jerry and Kim parked their truck in your yard and waited with you and Karen in your house; as all 4-of you stalked me from your house waiting for hours for me to return. Kim and Jerry then immediately appeared at my back door with his first unlawful letter. Then, Jerry and Kim returned to your “Command Center for Stalking and for contriving deceitfulness to broadcast down the block WAS criminally insane,” Oh, I mean your home, to discuss their authoritative coup over innocent people. I document the event and gave it to my attorney and I discussed filing stalking charges against Jerry, Kim, Jim, and Karen, but decided to address other issues in the letter because Denise’s condition was the focus of the letter.Jerry and Kim absolutely distressed Denise with unlawful threats and their breach of contract during this critical time right after her first surgery. Denise was working so hard in rehab, but her hip popped out a 2nd time at home. Denise had already documented her distressed unhappiness over Jerry’s behavior with her Doctors concerning the events of Jerry’s unlawful invasive and threatening behavior into our lives and the extreme trauma he had placed upon both of us. Denise was very nervous with Jerry confronting me because when I opened the patio door he was standing so close to the screen door, I told him to back up before I would open the screen and take his letter. Jerry’s face and my face were 2-feet apart when I opened the screen door it was obvious Jerry was trying to physically intimate me with his aggressive demeanor and his unlawful physical presence on the property.Jerry and Kim continued harassment; threats of deceitful schemes into our lives were the primary contributing painful factors forcing Denise to work very hard to be able to walk again.2.         The second illegal Notice Jerry delivered in person. Jerry was again waiting in your yard JIM and when I pulled into the garage he zoomed his truck up sliding on the rocks just stopping 6-feet from the garage door as I was getting out of my car in the garage. It scared the hell out of me, the noise and rocks flying echoed inside the garage. I got out and Jerry tried to get in my face, closer than  3-feet and gave me his second unlawful letter this was the second time Jerry had tried to physically intimate me by closing the space closer than 3-feet between us my arms reach is 32 inches.Denise had now become part of a Class Action Law Suit in 2017 against the Hip Replacement Manufacture and she very meticulously documented Jerry’s continued repulsive horrible abusive presence in our lives, Denise documented the day to day agony, tears and gut-wrenching stress because there was nothing we could do and Denise had to face this trauma alone in Texas. Each attorney letter we had written we discussed Jerry’s mental state because none of the attorneys could find logic or reason for his illegal harassment other than his delusive personal loathing and cultural prejudice against us. We have pictures of all the paintings and statues and video of the house for the court.The continued persecution and unlawful text threats by Jerry have never stopped and the duress and emotional pain and suffering has been documented every day in the 100’s of phone calls and e-mails between Denise and Dylan always discussing what in the hell Jerry, Kim, Jim, and Karen would do next to cause more extended pain and suffering in our lives for the past 1.5 years.Last summer Roger and I walked over to the man with the red dully truck next to my house and said hello neither of us had ever met the man. The man was extremely rude, would not even speak to us when we said hello again he turned his back and walked away, TWICE!! Roger and I discussed it with Mary and again it was very strange neither of us had ever met the man. Then, I met the woman with the redheaded kids from across the street in the store, she was not only very rude, but looked angry when I said hello and walked away from me without saying a word. I did not even know her name and the cashier at McKays said she was going to talk with Susan because she was her realtor and find out what the hell was wrong with her! Jim do you understand Jerry parked at your house legally incriminating you and Karen; into every hate-filled liable conversation, to spread this hatred for life down this block against Denise and Dylan. Denise’s paralegal field was Medical Malpractice and Personal Injury she had no idea she would someday be preparing her own legal case and when we have all the totals we will choose an attorney. You have no idea how satisfying it is going to make Denise draft “The Case Discovery” for each of you. Jim, we have the financial totals for the 4-hip operations, now all we need are the final totals for the 1½ years of in-house rehabilitation. Since Jerry and Kim have fully documented their loathing, unlawful prejudice and breach of contract forcing us to move we had legal and medical advice and because of your illegal harassment Denise will not return to the house. While Denise was in extensive rehab month after month not walking or standing without a walker seeing pictures of the house and myself was great motivation in spite of Jerry and Kim’s obsession.Dylan has been waiting for Denise to recover for a year because he desperately needs operations on both feet and has not left the house more than 3-times a month because it’s too painful to walk, and he cannot pack the house himself.Now Jerry, Kim, Jim and Karen we are going to pack up to move and it’s important to Denise and I, that we also include all of our moving expenses as our continued legal pain and suffering, this is further evidence of the conniving persecution against us unlawfully committed by Jerry and Kim ignoring the legal requests and demands from our attorneys and Doctor. Denise is still in rehab, but her sister in law in Vermont has convinced us it’s just as beautiful and has sent us several houses to look at, to get us out of COMMUNIST OREGON. Oh, Jim and Karen you really need to thank your friend Jerry for telling us he needed to make a $100 profit on the house that was why he was raising the rent. So, we decided legally we needed to look at all the public records and find out how much property both business and personal Jerry and Kim own so we can calculate the legal importance of raising the rent $100 a month on a house they have owned for years and just collected $25,000 in rent. This will all come out in legal discovery and we mean everything Jim this is the long, very slow and dutiful process where our attorneys decide how to win the case in court. All we are waiting for now are the final Medical and Rehab totals, which are about a million. Next, we have to calculate the Pain & Suffering, which is multiplied by 3, but the victims, can be awarded more. This is the exciting part for us for retribution for the month by month abusive behavior. So, we did not want to deprive Jerry, Kim, Jim, and Karen of further faithless enjoyment as you continue to laugh and discuss our enduring tragedy. We wanted you too share in the pain and suffering during your final stage of terrible abuse, before you must account for your merciless actions in front of a jury of honest men and women.When I came over to your house the first time in a year and showed you my published book “theEthics” of Honorable Intelligence and gave you my website EthicsofTruth-23.com. I was looking in your eyes for honesty and when Karen listened around the corner to our conversation she never came out and never faced me. I then realized how complicit each of you was in the discussion and enjoyment of Jerry’s wicked and his EVIL COMMUNIST behavior against us.I have copy-written many books and I will produce your case into a book, do you like this title “The Evil Snakes of Winchester Bay” and guess what it will be biographical with the name of every person involved it will capture all our detailed emotional suffering, and our judgments and opinions of every invasive account in our lives whether permissible or not. When, we finalize the court case the jury and the world can read about our persecution and innocence on Kindle with my other books. Now Jerry, Kim, Jim and Karen if your lives were boring before we can assure you there are tons of excitement coming down the road for many years after we are gone from Oregon for you to discuss.AS we did and have warned you California Communist; not to screw with AMERICAN-TEXANS.Jim do not forget to tell your friends Jerry and Kim how thankful you are for inviting his and our attorneys, and courts into your home, family life, and your financial declarations. This is why discovery takes many years before you even come to court. Just think of all the free publicity you will get here in Windy Bay as you explain your story over and over at the little store to all your fishing friends. Denise -              YOU  2-old Dragon Nymphs need to know; who you have been persecuting these past yearsParalegal and English Teacher      DenisetheTutor.com   -  go to my Bio because this woman is going to get involved in your FUCKING LIVES!!!!!!!!Dylan USMC Retired Sgt., 19715-23-2018 - The Medical LetterE-mail to Joanna Harkey, May 23 at 10:40 AMTo:     Joanna Harkey,Managing AttorneyDirector, Professional Liability DivisionOffice of General CounselTexas Tech University Medical System Joanna, why in the hell do you think that 'Demand Letter"" was directed to the President of the Texas Medical Center for fun and games?I requested 2-letter from Dr. Simpson first the letter requested and sent on Denise's behalf and the letter of apology for being such a jerk. He admits Denise requested the document from Dr. Simpson and then denies Denise has left several messages on the answering system, where he never returns calls or messages and today still continues to ignore Denise's request for this public letter weeks later.  Instead, the good Dr. Simpson giving us the letter, he calls us all legally a liar I'm not sure if that took nerve or it was paranoia. Then, you request another written request that will take weeks if it ever came, if the doctor does not forget again or has lost the letter as he has previously claimed. I am sorry I did convey this letter to the wrong person it was an easy fix. I think we need a second Doctor’s opinion on this case to see who is lying. I should have directed the letter to the Board of Directors and a Psychiatrist I spoke with outside the Medical Center because Dr. Simpson has exacerbated his own situation with ""Demute Doctoral Memory.""Joanna, you do not have a copy of the letter!  As the Attorney representing the Texas Medical Center, he can send the letter to you and you can release the letter. When you get a copy send an e-mail with a letter copy today and also, cc me that you have sent the letter so I can tell Denise to look for the 2-letters, sometimes she has internet and not.  We are having enough trouble in life we certainly did not need this aggravation of continued stress from a Doctor of Medicine.The ball is in the Doctors court, do the right thing and stop playing mindless games, Dylan Jerry and Kim had our Doctor letter FedEx on April 4, 2018 and WE  are sure they threw it in the trash like all our other attorney letters. Do you understand how Evil Communism and Hatred are a disease of the mind and is not only cancer on the evil person, but infects every other person they encounter in life!!!!  YOU WILL ALWAYS KNOW CALIFORNIA COMMUNIST THEY HAVE ONLY HATRED  -                                                                             WITH ZERO-NO REMORSE.                          LOOK AT THIS LETTER WE DID EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO ASK                                                     FOR HUMAN COMPASSION FOR OUR SITUATION !!!!Do you notice we gave Jim and Karen this letter the same day Jerry was filing his Eviction Notice did we know Jerry's vindictive hatred??Jerry's very stressful personal SEXUAL PASSIONS and destructive endless interruptions in our lives for the past 2-year leave no doubt of his narcissistic attitude that we ""Did not get his Permission"" reflects his perceptions on how aggressive his behavior is in life. Either you get Jerry Felgenhauer Permission or he opens his EVIL  bag of tricks and disturbing DICTATORIAL BEHAVIOR on the little people of Oregon, we are not the first, but we will be the last people he tries to destroy, with your help!5-31-2018If you know Jerry or have had the misfortune to have known Jerry please leave a little message if you donate, everyone here wants to hear your personal story, thanks again.Jerry retained Attorney David Tilton of Coos Bay, OR to legally document his vengeful evil-campaign against Denise and Dylan and to the world. Since Mr. Tilton has been a practicing Oregon Attorney for 33-years we can only presume Jerry and David have been doing business for many years. When you read Davids Letter of Termination stating our $1,000 deposit, but he amazingly leaves off the $600 cat deposit from his Declaration Letter of Termination !As a practicing attorney for 33-years did David just forget to ask Jerry for a copy of the Original Contract he was legally enforcing for Jerry & Kim Felgenhauer? I believe a 1st-year law student would have asked to see the ORIGINAL CONTRACT, so the evidence suggests their business relationship was strong enough; it was totally irrelevant for Attorney David Tilton to request or even to look at the original contract before writing his attorney letter.If David had even asked to look at the 2-different originally signed contracts, there was a $300 cat deposit, which was omitted from his attorney letter. Next, maybe attorney David should have even gone farther and asked his GOOD FRIEND Jerry if there was an addendum's to the Original Contact. In this 33-year of experienced attorney David should have learned this procedure, as there was an addendum with an additional $300 cat deposit. So, Attorney David Tilton and Jerry & Kim Felgenhauer decided to omit the $600 cat deposits, which was the TOTAL FOCUS of Jerry's harassment, stalking, bullying of Dylan for the past 2-years and the illegal termination of the contract forcing us to move. Attorney David Tilton lists; 590 Commercial Ave, Coos Bay, OR 97420 as his office, but on Google Earth it is an empty lot. We couldn't help but wonder why an attorney of 33-years would have listed this address as the actual Business Law Office address?Now, after you read our story, I wonder how many will think this was just an accident or was this a terrible felony of collusion to fraud in writing?  This will be for the Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Fredrick Boss, Deputy Attorney General to investigate and charge; as the documents validate this illegal defraud with evil dishonesty.                 THIS IS THE  STORY OF OUR DECLINING HEALTH, DETERMINATION TO DEFEND OUR GOOD NAME                                                                                                                              and                                                                                     THE STORY CONTINUES TO THIS DAY6-11-2018  -                  OUR TERRIBLE PART II – The Nightmare the  Death-Trap SANDBAGGED  CONDO   -                                                 in our new    SAN DIEGO, CA.    GoFundMe page.                                                     6-19-2018 Denise was having a lot of trouble in rehab the muscles were not healing as fast as everyone had hoped and she was still in a walker to do everything, her main connection with the outside world was Dylan as he told her the news and discussed endless topics history, anthropology, art, poems and songs.Dylan met Jim Forester of Reedsport, OR when he brought his grandson Damien over to help in the packing of the house on 1050 Broadway Ave, Winchester Bay, OR 97467.Dylan was in a terrible condition with very poor health taking only Pepto-Bismol and a glass of hot water in the morning, coffee was too strong and the compulsion of packing every day and night for 4-weeks at 67 years was an impossible task even for a Marine. Dylan had to over pack every painting; vase, statue, and lamp etc. for the journey 2500 miles over the terrible roads of I-5 and I-10 through California. He had driven from Texas over the patchwork on the highways that just rattle your teeth down each terrible mile. On the drive back from Eugene to Los Angeles, these Interstate highways have not had any serious repairs for        5-20-years and there was NO roadwork being performed in Oregon or California, but when Dylan got to I-40 it was under repair all through in Arizona, N.M., and Texas. Dylan is so meticulous packer everything made it, nothing was broken.Jim brought Damien’s girlfriend Sinead over to clean the refrigerator for all the condiments and frozen food dinners and other food Dylan bought and did not eat that last week. Dylan paid her to pack the kitchen cabinets, food, glasses etc. Jim talked a lot with Dylan about the troubles he was having with his grandson Damien, as they argued all the time. Jim also complained about Sinead and Damien’s arguing so loud in his bedroom at night that Jim and Janet heard every word.Dylan and Damien cleaned and vacuumed the 2-back bedrooms and the full bath. Dylan had been working for over a month straight every day, all day and was at the point of exhaustion at 67 years old. Jim had taken Dylan to Coos Bay to get more tape and boxes and Dylan and Jim had agreed on 6-27 9 am when Jim took him to get the truck that Sinead was going to vacuum and pick up the house, the plastic bubble wrap, and paper trash. Dylan paid Jim in cash for all assistance and help in preparing the move.The very last box on the 26- ft truck was the Charter DVR, router and cable box the lid was not taped because the tape gun was packed and there was no time to return them. Dylan unpacked the truck and found the Charter box was missing the DVR! Damian and Carter were the only other people in the house. I disconnected the TV and Charter equip the last thing before I went to bed on 6-26-2018 and they were sitting in my closet s the very last to be loaded.                  09/01/18                 CHARTER COMM                888-438-2427 MO                                                                 $123.00So, now on top of the other felonies, we find grand theft for  $123.00 and now I'm concerned they might have stolen some other property. These charges are very serious and if Damian and Carter planned this robbery together this compounds the crime.The 4th Attorney Letter to  Jerry Felgenhauer6-21-2018 WE NEVER RECEIVE THAT ""LETTER OF RENTAL PAYMENTS"" even though we were never late and even paid JERRY'S endless water bill from the sprinkler running for 2-years. We told our bewildered Attorney the idea of Jerry doing something GOOD for another Human Being is about 1 to 50-million chance.6-26-2018   This was the last day Dylan picked up mail at the Post Office in the Winchester Bay Store, he just did not have time for the ""Change of Address"" as Dylan woke up very, very sick and exhausted every day!6-27-2018 TRUCK DAY - Jim brought Damien’s high school friend Carter who was 16 yrs. old to help pack the truck. Carter worked hard and did a good job all the way to the end closing the U-Haul door. Dylan paid $20 an hour but could get no takers in Reedsport or Winchester Bay NO MEN WANTED TO WORK, asked in the little stores, some churches, asked the Windy Bay Fire Dept 2-times  and if you live there you understand the pathetic reason why nothing gets done and the poverty level is outrageous.                THIS ADVERTISEMENT WAS IN THE SHOP NEXT TO SAFEWAY, was THIS REALLY DISNEYLAND.....                                                                 Do you understand the REEDSPORT LABOR labor situation, NOW!!This is a custom, crushed suede burgundy couch & love seat, we bought in Scottsdale, Az., which was $1800 and was never used it was in my office with painting and books on them. I listed them for $400 and got no calls and finally I offered them to the man at the Fire Dept. twice after their Wed. meeting, they could have them, for helping with the book cabinets, books etc. I gave the man my business card they never called, showed up or helped. I could find no men in Reedsport or even Reedsport to help pack and move for a month to move the couches. So, I had to give them away for FREE just to get them moved, extremely, unhappy, beautiful couches and very comfortable. The flash did not work on the 7-foot couch, but they look the same.They packed all the paintings in the 6x12 ft. trailer it was full and then started on the 26-ft truck there was just Carter, Damien and Dylan at the house and during their many breaks Damien and Carter were discussing the behavior of Sinead just leaving and she did not say a word and how difficult a person she was to get along with. They told Dylan that Sinead was just 16 years old and a junior in high school. Dylan asked Damien if Sinead spent the night with him and he said: “hell, yea.” Dylan asked Damien if Jim and Janet knew Sinead was sleeping with him and he said, “yea.” Dylan said he was shocked how demeaning and easy they talked about the girl.Later Dylan told Jim what a terrible situation Sinead had left him in by going to Florence when she had agreed to vacuum and pick up the house and clean back bath as the kitchen was already done. Jim, Janet, Carter, Damien, and Sinead had all been to the GoFundMe website from the very first day they met Dylan so they each knew about Comrade Jerry.The loading took another 2-hours and when all the property was taken out of the house and the truck and trailer were ready to go, Dylan, Damien, and Carter sat in the garage on the landing and discussed what was needed to clean the house. Damien stated he was leaving for his family in California in the morning. Dylan was in a very desperate situation he had to get the rest of the house vacuumed and cleaned so he asked Carter but he refused until Dylan offered him $100 to just vacuum and pick up the floor and garage. Carter agreed to come over in the morning of 6-29-2018 and Dylan quickly ran through the things that needed to be done then looked at Damien who stated: “I’ll make sure before we leave.”Dylan gave Carter two one hundred dollar bills and 2-20’s and a $10 equaling $250 and all the keys to the house and told him to leave them on the counter and take pictures of the house and garage and e-mail them to him and put the garage opener was above the sprinkler system. That was $150 for Damien and Carters help to load the truck and the $100 paid in advance to Carter. This was the agreed price of $100 for about 2-hours work required for services paid for in advance witnessed by Damien standing 3-feet away. Dylan reiterated the extreme importance of doing a good job and thanked Carter over and over for helping him out of this terrible situation of having to get someone at the very last minute to clean the house then Dylan shook Carter's hand and Damien’s. 6-28-18 It was now 7 pm and Dylan got in the cab and Carter and Damien got in Jim's car and everyone said goodbye. Neither Carter nor Damien called or e-mailed Dylan as he was driving back. This created endless worry driving the 2500 miles back. When he arrived 3-days later he talked with Jim and he said he would look into it and that was the last communication.Jerry sent pictures of the house on 7-3-18 Carter never came back and fraud Dylan out of $100 and stole the house keys.7-4-18Synese (syneses23@yahoo.com)To:  Jerry FelgenhauerJul 4 at 9:55 PMJerryAs a Paralegal, I do not want to hear your psychotic ravings against the good name of Dylan, a Disabled Marine Sergeant. I would suggest that you discuss this with your GREAT FRIEND attorney, David Tilton. Maybe he can instruct you on the legal description of Defamation of Character on Dylan.Denise 7-7-2018      Dylan put in a change of address to his next house7-10-18Synese To: Jerry Felgenhauer Jul 10 at 10:08 AM JerryIt's important to understand in dealing with the black mold, because Dylan needed two-foot surgeries, he didn't put any boxes or items in any of the lower cabinets in the kitchen. Dylan was sick most of the two years he lived in the house. We thought it was weather or allergies, but now we are convinced it was from the BLACK MOLD in the kitchen. Because Dylan never opened up the bottom cabinets in the kitchen he was unaware of the fauset water leak and the black mold under the sink until Shania the girl that helped to clean, opened the cabinet and showed the black mold to him. She tried to clean it out but Dylan told her not to. Dylan realized it was black mold down there and thiswas the Landlord's responsibility to handle not the tenants. Jerry, you didn't send pictures of the BLACK MOLD  or back bedrooms. Dylan vacuumed and put carpet refresher on the carpets in both back bedrooms and the living room. Dylan finished moving everything out of the house and he gave Carter and Damien $250. $150 to help with the final load in the truck and the other $100 to pick up the trash in the house, vacuum the floors and clean out the garage. Dylan left the keys with Carter but we did not know Carter did nothing to clean the house and did not leave the keys in the house.

DYLAN - HAD NO IDEA HE WOULD BE PACKING TO MOVE BACK TO TEXAS!!!!!You can see the Great Wall 9X5.8 ft the statues, large vases, and all the stuff to packIt takes a whole month packing every day to pack the house and for a sick man the job was impossible, but Dylan packed everything because he's a Marine and failure has never, ever been an option.The painting of Shao Rong her painting is on the book cover took 2-hours to pack, WOW Dylan was talking with me as he was packing Shao, he loved getting that close to the painting with Shao in his hands as Shao is even more alluring.What you see in front of you covered in boxes is the 9X5.8 ft oil painting of the Great Wall of China can you see the black cabinet with gold images to the right this a Chinese Bar and very heavy and hard to pack. The Great Wall of China, silk tree and tall Chin Ming statues standing and packed to the rightThe grandfather clock is the most difficult to pack and beveled glass brass bar is always difficult the top glass is very, very heavy for to 2-men to pick up carrying is very slow.Frank is always looking down over the bar, notice the 2-orange amoral boxed on the bar, I used up 5-boxes vacuuming.The 1st bedroom had carpet freshener and vacuumed.  The 2nd bedroom above, where Jerry piled the cinder blocks outside the window. I never used the room just stored musical equipment, amps, recorders, mics stands, boxes of recorded material etc. The room door was always closed for 2-years and was refreshed and vacuumed. Front door there is just small items on the floor before the armoral and vacuumedFront dining-room, a large Chinese area rug cover the floor used carpet fresher and vacuumed.ALL THE ROOM NEEDED WAS TO BE SHAMPOOED ITS JUST DIRTSEE WHERE THE CARPET WAS UNDER HIS DESK!!   IF JERRY COULD HAVE REPLACED THE CARPET HE WOULD HAVE!!This was Dylan's office HE watched TV and spent about 8-15 hours a day writing and working on his books and living quarters for 2-years because of the EVIL Peeping Tom. HE kept the doors closed in the front 2-bedrooms and the front bathroom was filled with books and painting, that he didn't want to hang. You can see the orange Amoral box in the left corner this was the final room to be cleared, but not cleaned.Dylan was totally exhausted and I was very worried now because Dylan would get in the truck and would drive non-stop and arrived in 3-days. NOW, do you know any man who could have done this HELL NO..... DYLAN IS A MARINE!!!!!I have seen him do the impossible many many times and he always just amazes me, like how he figures a 2500-mile trip in his head and then leaves because with a truck and trailer, AS you have to time getting to each large city at 1-3 am the best time. Here is a rest stop for Dylan: he calls I'm in the Nissan behind him and we pull over I was so tired I just put my head back and I'm asleep. Dylan gets outs stretches and walks around the truck and trail and looks at everything, goes to the bathroom gets in the truck and calls me, time to roll, kid.Small front dining-room just boxes to be picked-up before vacuuming.Front bath never used stored painting and boxes.Kitchen, refrig, and stove cleaned, never used the oven used a crock-pot.                                                       Living-room just some pick up stuff on the floor nowThis is Jerry's picture, Dylan did back into this rain drain. So Jerry replaced the entire rain gutter system and that must be Jerry's wine box. Why did Jerry place a wine box in this picture, very low-level psychology is our only explanation.7-17-18Synese To: Jerry FelgenhauerJul 17 at 3:26 PMJerry We need to finalize this move out so please send us the final charges, pictures, receipts, and our refund today.

I still do not have a estimate for the rain gutter. Parkers bill was $1200.00, a breakdown is on the bill. Landscaping estimate from Leo's was $450.00 but that included washing the outside of the house, still to high. I took care of the landscaping (no charge) and Parker did the house outside ( noted on his bill). Dylan had holes in most all the walls so they had to be patched and painted, an estimate was for $3000.00, way to high, so I bought paint and paint supplies ,$416.89. Two screens had cat claw tares, had to repair. Kitchen faucet had to be replaced . I took all Dylan's trash to the dump, $12.00. Please note that I have not  charged for any of my many hours of labor or the trips to the dump or Coos Bay for parts and supplies. Totals $12.00 + $117.00 + $1200.00 + $416.89 = $1745.98- deposit $1618.00= $127.98 loss.

Here is Denise’s website she has used for 5-years; go to biography to verify education and extraordinary professionalism.   Denisethetutor.comAs you will discover Dylan just published his 3rd book Mar-2018 “theEthics” of Honorable Intelligence and instead of working on re-writing his 7th book on quantum physics, we are right now preparing a book documenting these past 2-3 years, the future will write itself.

Jerry created this terrible story up to here, but we are going to write the final chapter in his book of destructive evil. The story of this possible statutory rape, crime and theft:6-17-18        Dylan was in a terrible condition with very poor health taking only Pepto-Bismol and a glass of hot water in the morning, coffee was too strong and the compulsion of packing every day and night for 4-weeks at 67 years was an impossible, task even for a Marine. Dylan had to over pack every painting; vase, statue, and lamp etc. for the journey 2500 miles over the terrible roads. Dylan met Jim Forester of Reedsport, OR when he brought his grandson Damien over to help in the packing of the house on 1050 Broadway Ave, Winchester Bay, OR 97467.       cell:  805-406-1389   530-227-3890   707-601-8976   the numbers of Jim and Damien. Damian is 19-years old and was extremely helpful in moving boxes, vacuuming, cleaning etc. Jim confided in Dylan over the next few days that Damian had a 7th-grade reading level and was home/self-taught and did not go to school. Jim asked could Dylan help because he and Damian had a lot of trouble communicating. Dylan sent Damien and Jim to his book website: ethicsoftruth-23.com thinking all the amazing pictures and the international story might inspire or perk Damien’s need to read and to get educated about life. Dylan gave Damien his new red pizza oven and new BBQ smoker for all his help.Of course, they asked Dylan why he was moving and it just did not make sense because he was too sick to pack the house and drive the long drive 2500 miles back. Dylan told Jim about the GoFundMe website “The painful journey to live a dream.” The next day Jim told Dylan he, Janet, Sinead, Carter, Shane, and Damian had seen at the website and he gave their prayers.Jim brought Damien’s girlfriend Sinead over to clean the refrigerator for all the condiments and frozen food dinners and other food Dylan bought and did not eat that last week. Dylan paid her to pack the kitchen cabinets, food, glasses etc. Jim talked a lot with Dylan about the troubles he was having with his grandson Damien, as they argued all the time. Jim also complained about Sinead and Damien’s arguing so loud in his bedroom at night that Jim and Janet heard every word.Dylan and Damien cleaned, armoral and vacuumed the 2-back bedrooms, and the front full bath. Dylan had been working for over a month straight every day, all day and was at the point of exhaustion at 67 years old. Jim had taken Dylan to Coos Bay to get more tape and boxes and Dylan and Jim had agreed on June-27 9am when Jim took him to get the truck.  Sinead had agreed and was going to vacuum and pick up the house, the plastic bubble wrap and paper trash. Dylan paid Jim in cash for all assistance and help in preparing the move.June-27-2018 TRUCK DAY - Jim brought Damien’s high school friend Carter who was 16 yrs. old to help pack the truck. Carter worked hard and did a good job all the way to the end closing the truck door. Dylan paid $20 an hour but could get no takers in Reedsport or Winchester Bay and if you live there you understand the hopeless pathetic reason, why. They packed all the paintings in the 6x12 ft. trailer and then started on the 26-ft truck. There was just Carter, Damien and Dylan at the house and during their many breaks Damien and Carter were discussing the behavior of Sinead just leaving and how difficult a person she was to get along with. They told Dylan that Sinead was just 16 years old and a junior in high school. Dylan just outright asked Damien if Sinead spent the night with him and he said: “hell, yea.” Dylan asked Damien if Jim and Janet knew Sinead was sleeping with him and he said, “yea.” Later Dylan told Jim what a terrible situation Sinead had left him in by going to Florence when she had agreed to vacuum and pick up the back bath as the kitchen was already done. Jim, Janet, Carter, Damien and Sinead had all been to the GoFundMe website from the very first day they met Dylan, so they each knew about the revengefulness of Jerry. The loading took another 2-hours and when all the property was taken out of the house and the truck and trailer were ready to go, Dylan, Damien, and Carter sat in the garage on the landing and discussed what was needed to clean the house. Damien stated he was leaving for his family in California in the morning. Dylan was in a very desperate situation he had to get the rest of the house vacuumed and cleaned so he asked Carter but he refused until Dylan offered him $100 to just vacuum and pick up the floor and garage. Carter agreed to come over in the morning of 6-28-2018 and Dylan quickly ran through the things that needed to be done then looked at Damien who stated: “I’ll make sure before we leave.”Dylan gave Carter two one hundred dollar bills and 2-20’s and a $10 equaling $250 and all the keys to the house and told him to leave them on the counter and take pictures of the house and garage and e-mail them to him and the garage opener was above the sprinkler system. That was $150 for Damien and Carters help to load the truck and the $100 paid in advance to Carter. This was the agreed price of $100 for about 2-hours work required for services paid for in advance witnessed by Damien standing 3-feet away. Dylan reiterated the extreme importance of doing a good job and thanked Carter over and over for helping him out of this terrible situation of having to get someone at the very last minute to clean the house, then Dylan shook Carters hand and Damien’s.It was now 7pm 6-27-18 and Dylan got in the cab and Carter and Damien got in Jims car and everyone said goodbye. Neither Carter nor Damien called or e-mailed Dylan as he was driving back. 3-days later he talked with Jim and he said, “He would look into it and that was the last communication.”7-3-2018 Jerry sent pictures of the house. Carter never came back to the house and fraud Dylan out of $100 and he stole the house keys. You can contact Edward and his wife who run the Taxi Service in Reedsport they know the kids and where everyone lives, FYI.This the truth to the best of our knowledge,Dylan Denise                                                        SINCE THIS WAS IN THE BLUE-LEFT-WING STATE OF OREGON                                                                                                   THERE WOULD NEVER                                                                                                      BE ANY REPLIES                                                     BECAUSE SOMEONE;  WOULD HAVE TO BE. . . . .

The multifaceted levels of extreme-stress and worse being forced to move took its toll as it made our hair fall out. Dylan was really sick in May 2018 he could not even pack a box. Jerry had succeeded in his evil scheme to prevent Dylan from living a happy life. This is why I worked for many months to convince Dylan to ePublish his Song Book. In the 2-years Dylan was there he had many days and nights with the deer, wild cats and raccoons they all came to see him, he was the only one up at 2-5 am. The deer would walk on the gravel by his window so he would come out and Frisbee bread to them.  He could Frisbee a slice of bread 30-40 feet and drop it at each deer's feet, he learned from throwing to the raccoons at our home on Camano Island, WA. There were times when he would call ME before he called the deer and set the cell on the railing. So, I could live that special moment in time, Dylan had names for his deer of course, but those memories have been dissipated by FROM YEARS OF PAIN in our lives, he won't tell me now. This male is from Mom's first liter this is at 2.5 years.This picture was taken in the front yard 6-2017 how do you like how JERRY beautified the yard it's now been a year JERRY charge Dylan $89 a month for water he had to pay. Mom is closest to you Dylan could walk by each deer and they never even looked up. The deer had NO FEAR from Dylan because he has always been a PROUD AMERICAN and has led his life by ""The GOLDEN RULE, EVEN WITH ANIMAL!!""There was a lot of deer that passed through and about 10-deer that were a little family because mom brought her new fawns to see him... One night mom brought 4-huge male deer 10-12 points, large.... for him to watch their mating rituals, mom would come and stand by the porch to get away and Dylan would sit there and talk to her like she was his little sister. AS the Buck charged each other and snorted and kick up the ground, I was there listening, as he narrated he would talk about the shadows and the light, as the males would come out of the dark for mom to see their antlers, haha.He would start calling  in the rain, fog or snow and say ""Well hello kids what have you been doing nice to see you, come and see me"" they are about 90 feet away and their head look up from the sweet grass, and he calls them with his sound,. . . . . it's not loud, its the frequency, it permeates the sound of rain, and the male deer shake their head, while they are walking forward, but mom passes them all in a sprint and like little ducks the run tooo, until they are all in the little front yard.Now back to our terrible reality:Dylan had a full head of hair NO GRAY and I was so jealous as I have colored my hair now for 20-years. In these months his hair started filling up this comb after a shower. He lost his part in his hair and he started losing hair on the crown of his head in Oregon and continued for 3-months AFTER THE MOVE. Dylan lost a lot of hair.  Dylan is in good shape for never leaving the house he does push up off the sink about 2-300 a day or more every day he weighed 242 lbs. on May 1, 2018, when he arrived after 2500-miles he weighed 207 lbs. from the sickness of working night and day, I was so terribly worried because Dylan never stops when he is working. Denise was having the same effects of stress on her body as everything was both extremely physical and mental. This endless duress affected us differently, lack of sleep, headaches, bad dreams, etc. but the worse was we both started having teeth problems and Denise had beautiful white teeth and a great smile.The reason my Doctor wrote his letter to evil Jerry and Kim was he had been there through months of rehab and with Denise’s last surgery he was well aware of the fiscal stress we had, trying to pay all the financial bills. Denise had not worked in 1.8 years and we had used all our ""HOUSE SAVING"" to keep up the car, insurance, school loans, medical bills, cell phones, etc. Dylan could pay all his bills in Oregon and live, but there was no extra money needed for packing material, tape, boxes, or cash for labor to load and unload the truck and trailer.9-27-18                THE RESULTS OF JERRY AND KIM'S PLOT OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNISTIC-HATREDBeing forced to move in June meant we had to use our 3-credit cards to move, our balances were Zero on the American Express for the last 6-months and just a $100 each on the other 2-Navy Federal cards. We both had a FICO over 735 in May 2018 and by September Dylan’s FICO was 630 and Denise’s was 634 this was the result of moving in June this is why the Doctor expressly stated to give us 6-months to restructure our lives from so much heartbreaking Personal and Financial tragedies. Of course, this is what the bastard Jerry ABSOLUTELY wants to hear, now do you see why HE ramped up his EVICTION SCHEME to put COMMUNISTIC pressure on Dylan, never caring I was ALWAYS on the other end of the phone crying my eyes out, as my LIFE and MY HEART had been destroyed.The interest charges on 3-card are about $250 a month because I had to NOW put my 1-bed Apt. rent, all my utilities and all my food, bills and car expenses on the cards for 4-months as I was getting back to work. I went from $45,000 to ZERO in one day, there is no way to explain unless it has happened to YOU! Yes, thank GOD  I can be alone and live outside of rehab, as I began teaching using my stroller/walker to get around, but starting back was very slow just a day a week, then 2-days. The stress of being FORCED to return to work before I was able and ready is the extended ""PAIN & SUFFERING"" caused by these scumbag individuals, they are not even Human Beings.The psychological and emotional stress of knowing  Communists needs to be revealed to every American and the entire world. These communists will be ""POSTER BOARD COMRADES"" for Oregon and California for many years to come. Interstate billboards before the 2020 Elections should be created with their pictures in every State, so honest Americans can be warned about doing business with ANY California Communist!!!        They have no Human REMORSE:    FOR THE EVIL THEY HAVE DONE AND WILL DO TO SOMEONE ELSEThe Attorney and Doctors Letters were like waving a Communist Red Flag in front of Jerry the balless-bully, as his harassment continued and telling him to leave us alone per the Doctor’s Demand Letter only escalated his psychotic-hatred. We knew we would have our day in court and expose these heartless-bastards, but the cost has been overwhelming for both of us going on 3-years of our wonderful creative lives have been absolutely derailed. Jerry further demonstrated his disregard for the Laws of Oregon when he decided to steal our Deposit Money. This is the problem, when an evil-man has “The COMMUNIST-GOD Syndrome” and thinks he is untouchable by the law and society.12-28-2018Very, unfortunately, Dylan was going upstairs and the railing broke from the wall and his right hand did not let go,    as he slid down the stairs. I know if his hand had let loose he would have tumbled 18 feet to the concrete slab below. Dylan is now taking rehab and using a 3-lbs. weight to strengthen his bicep, rhomboids and trapezoid muscles, which were damaged in the fall.I need so much, more rehab, because of Comrade Jerry. I have worried endlessly about our future and my future every day, as I know sleeping is impossible because long before I sleep, there will be eye pain of tears, over and over before I sleep every night for over 2-years, NOW!!Because JERRY is a direct causal denominator in our present financial situation this is our day of retribution. My goodness, we have so many e-mails and business addresses to send Jerry & Kim's postcards in Reedsport and Paso Robles; first, the Real Estate Brokers need to know JERRY, English Teachers at the high schools and colleges, and my favorite to the paralegals who keep every lawyer in business. By the time anyone reads this site the Mayors, D.A's and Governors, Senators and Representatives in OREGON and CALIFORNIA will have already received their postcards, so they each can get to know these merciless individuals, they are not even HUMAN BEINGS because by definition a Human is compassionate.We just wanted to retire and live our lives and I will tell you, Women, this terrible ordeal of my hip and dealing every day and month with JERRY has absolute taken years of our lives to live in HAPPINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am now 65-years old and have maybe 3-years left to teach, this is not enough time to rescue our lives from financial disparagement, destroying our credit is going to prevent us from buying another car, renting a nice house and any loans we might want to get or a mortgage the interest rate will be astronomical,.Just writing about our situation and our future lives is so depressing, as we are even today, re-living each terrible day, week, month and year since meeting the California Communist of Reedsport Oregon.................................................................................................................................................................................................8-3-2018To:  markll4papa@charter.net Aug 3 at 9:45 AM Do you remember reading this line? ""Jerry you need to direct the rest of your communications to me only. Denise is absolutely through reading your bigoted slop."" Jerry,   I told you to never contact Denise again and upset her with your childish ranting she is in a difficult rehab. If you contact her again I will document this as further harassment, bullying and intimidation tactics once again do you understand Jerry. You need to contact your buddy and friend Attorney David Tilton maybe he can educate you on the laws of Oregon, remember you are not in Marxist California.You need to legally document your fictitious charges against us. You need to present to me the details of your accounting acceptable in a court of law do you understand Jerry or you need to fully refund the money!Dylan Denise8-4-18 Text from Mary the homeowner who lives behind the Oregon house.Well, Jerry has found another innocent victim we just heard the terrible news. Do you understand why we stated Jerry's behavior was evil because he has no remorse for the terrible things he does to real Americans?We are in WB and the house is now listed.  Jerry rented out a RV space to a couple and told them to plug into a outside plug on your house and it was 220 and burned out all the wiring in the RV and it cost over 4K to fix. These people are P.O. they have to get it fixed and Jerry is not paying anything. 9-1-2018Dylan To: markll4papa@charter.net Sep 1 at 1:20 PM To:       Construction, Felgenhauer              Jerry & Kim Felgenhauer – Owners              550 River Oaks Drive              Paso Robles, CA 93446               markll4papa@charter.net                David Tilton, Attorney               590 Commercial               Coos Bay, OR 97420Fm:      Dylan Jerry and Kim, At the present time, you are thieves and think you can fraud us out of our money! You need to again consult with your attorney-friend David Tilton about; a residential rental for over 2-years in the Oregon Statues of Law -  90.300 and 90.302. Did you really think you could charge us for power washing the house, buying your tools and all the paint and supplies you listed, you could have painted 3-houses?

Today, we just learned that Tim Fancher the father has just beat-up Meagan and                                                           knocked out the teeth of his 10-year old Daughter Lily FancherHello Greg and Ken,There is no protection, safety or justice in Texas for Children!I am now sending this child threatening disorder of physical abuse to your immediate attention because of the failure of Gary Tidwell, District Attorney Office Thad Thomas – Investigator and Commissioner Mike Morath to protect the wellbeing of our 2-granddaughters and other young children in Texas.                                                                                                                                                                        This letter is focused on both of the 2-statements above concerning the well-being, protection and safety of Tifa and Lily Fancher.EVERY HOUR AND DAY WASTED; ENDANGERS THEIR YOUNG LIVESTHEIR ENVIRONMENT IS A VIOLENT DRUG INFESTED WAR ZONE, TODAY !The e-mail to Mike Morath, which is attached, brought no response, or actions to save the 2-girls from future violence and we believe their lives are in extreme LIFE-THREATENING danger because Tim is dealing meth and is probably addicted to meth, as we are told by a family eye-witness. Tim confessed the statements above to his aunt, in person, he had known all his life, when she told Denise; she warned Denise to Never give Tim her address and she was so terrified, she will never see Tim again!!!Here are the text messages Tim sent to Denise Stephens on her 65th birthday and she has now filed a “Restraint Order” against her only son. Tim thinks he is “Thor” the god of Thunder, as you will discover from the attached E-mails. For 18-years Tim would leave vulgar text messages and voice recordings always at 2-4am because it would upset her the most, before work.From: Thor Fancher <thorklown@gmail.com>To: Denise <syneses23@yahoo.com>Sent: Monday, August 13, 2018, 2:59:07 AM CDTSubject: You dead yet?Happy birthday.  NOW DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!! From: Thor Fancher <thorklown@gmail.com>To: Denise Sent: Sunday, September 16, 2018, 3:17:10 PM CDTSubject: Re: BirthdayYour not dead yet.  Fuck die!!!From: Timothy Fancher <invitations@linkedin.com>To: Denise Stephens <syneses23@yahoo.com>Sent: Monday, November 19, 2018, 7:02:16 PM CSTSubject: Denise, please add me to your LinkedIn network DeniseTo: Dylan Nov 20 at 10:07 AMThis is the text sent to me from Tim at 4: 37 a.m. this morning on Facebook Messenger: “Either tell me where you are or we can do it the hard way.  It is you choice I have things to say and I will find you.  Shit you are still in Texas and I know that.” I am calling Women’s Protective Services right now and talking to their attorney to put in place a protective order against him. This is the first time he's made me really really scared of him. I'm going to go buy a Louisville Slugger and put it by the front door just in case he does find me.                                                   This is a transcript of Dylan’s conversation Thad Thomas – DA Investigator: 10-12-17   Denise just called Mr. Thomas and after speaking she called me, I then called and spoke with Mr. Thomas. Thomas had the e-mail we had sent to Gary Tidwell and addressed to him. I requested he read the document, so he could understand the dangers of alerting Tim Fancher the father of the 2-girls Lily 9-years old and Tifa 5-years old. I told Thomas, “Tim had been arrested 3-times and we are charging him with child battery as he has left his hand-print of bruises on the girl’s butts.” Mr. Thomas said he could not read the document and was sending it to the police department. I stated, “If the police go over without a warrant for Tim and they alert him he will run and whatever happens to the girls will be on the Police.”Mr. Thomas said he had to follow the law and I again stated “This is a dangerous situation; if you would just read the document before you send it” Thomas said, “He was sending to the police.” I said, “I hope it turns out well because we will hold you personally responsible Mr. Thomas.” OK, Gov.  Abbott, you talk with Mr. Thomas and investigate who has intentionally destroyed our demand for police protection for Lily and Tifa???I have never met Lily and Tifa; this was not permitted by Tim their father,                                                                   So, my only intent is the rest-of-their-lives!These are the only pictures; WE have of Lily and Tifa in Denise’s arms taken in a restaurant in 2012. Now, either you investigate this violent behavioral parental conduct stated in these documents, or not and put the documents in the indecipherable pile of Citizen Grievances, once again. The Texas Children’s Protective Agency has already done this for YOU because it’s is another State Government Agency in your administration without any accountability for the children they ignore, because they NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE,  so they do not have to deny legal responsibility. This is the reality in Texas, today and you need to take charge of this decade-old contaminate State Despotism, NOW!! Fire some people and investigate the moral corruption of ineptness and irresponsibility to the parents and grandparents who have no other hope. Look what happened a year later!We have put this terrible story in writing and you can do your investigation or review or inquiry or analysis before or after this eBook is marketed. I will state unequivocally exposing the incompetence of this “Texas Teacher” is obvious, because this woman is the cream of the Texas Teachers Special Education crop. Just ask her to give their side of their own story! I believe the documents on themselves represent a pattern of psychological wickedness and living with a 6’4” convict bully. Teacher Meagan Fancher “Approved” of Tim’s lifestyle and indulged herself in unethical behavior and was consciously the accomplice for years of neglect and physical, psychosocial and educational abuse concerning all malfeasance directed towards these 2-girls. So, failure of Self-responsibility is direct insolvency of the State Education and Training received, you tell me Mary about Megan’s educational training and how this woman was given a teaching license! No One examined her background or investigated her own extremely questionable legal history of losing her own child Lily to Children’s Protective Services in Amarillo, Texas and why she lost custody!!! You do the discovery and read the endless case then just ask any of the Grandparents.7-22-17 Out of complete frustration and great aggravation with Denise’s disinterestedness, I took it on my own personal volition to write the letter to contact the DA in Lubbock. Do I trust the Childs Protective Service to do the right thing, hell no, but the option is leaving the 2-girls, where they are for life! An investigation into the all-inclusive environment of Lily and Tifa; targeting the strength and circumstances of their deficiency of education, their happiness, well-being, sense of security and the physical and mental health of the girls to succeed into the future, this is my professional concern this letter is addressing. I am not concerned with the State Bureaucracy; as far as we know the DA and Police of Lubbock did absolutely nothing they never returned a call or e-mail. When you go to the Gofundme.com page you will find very little of the background information of what is documented here, within our website. There are a lot of documents left out of the website, but are all included in the on-going 3-year timeline eBook, we are preparing to go public within weeks, you will see the book marketing postcards ordered months ago.Next, these events with Tifa and Lily happened inside the 3-year struggle by Denise and Dylan in another dreadful crisis in Oregon, which is documented in Gofundme.com -  put in “The Painful Journey to Live a Dream.” It is important to read and understand how we found out about the life-threatening imprisonment the 2-girls subsisted in, when it was Denise’s misfortune to accept Tim’s disingenuous invitation to help.Greg and Ken, these 2-little girls are lost in the bureaucratic chaos, as the present Texas Schools Agency System and churches have willingly accepted their physical and mental abuse of these 2-little girls, as part of their obedience of acknowledgment every day and have for many years, Why! Now you understand why I am sending this Human heartbreak to each of you, if these were your grandchildren what in the HELL would you do, now!!!!How about looking at their tests scores and their ability to perform educated tasks in relation to their peers in school? On the other hand, their peers are in the same system that ignored years of physical bruises, ZERO child psychological counseling and lack knowledge of education warning signs in child academic failure.What follows is the beginning of a 17-page timeline documentation of behavior. Denise and I talked every day 3-10 times and sent 100’s of e-mails for the last 2-years. These phone call conversation and e-mails between Denise and myself, were omitted from our GoFundme.com website and put into the eBook.I look forward to your reply and hearing of the immediate arrangements of taking the 2-girls into Child Protective Custody for the future wellbeing of Lily and Tifa, then, the arrest and prosecution of Tim Fancher and Meagan Fancher because we have no idea what criminal-business enterprises they were involved in together. If I do not hear from you; I will rightfully believe the same comatose apparatus of state government agencies listed above are today outside the command of the Texas Governor and the Attorney General. This eBook was the very last spectacle, I would ever want to write or worse to endure at 68.The book will be written and e-published next January; at this point, the only events in question will be the future for Lily and Tifa. These final chapters are transpiring today and will absolutely be written and the heroes and villains of this crisis of Human lives will be verified, recognized and documented. I have learned to expect, apathy because no one knows how “To-do-the-Right-Thing” or make intelligent decisions, Self-morality has been usurped by social-political morality and today we have fostered grown men and women so inept they are afraid of their very own shadows, am I not correct?We want to know what legal actions are being taken as Denise is petrified to go to school on Monday and she does not like guns! Dylan  - AuthorRetired USMC Sgt. 1971                                                                          THE  GREAT  REPUBLICAN STATE  OF  TEXASThis was the reply from the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office.  ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................... For Jerry and Kim being a millionaire means; They enrich their meaningless, unethical and immoral ideologies from California into a private invasion into our lives, and by tormenting very happy people, I would call this Evil and Sadistic COMMUNISTIC-BEHAVIOR!                                                                                                  HERE WE ARE TO DATE...................................TO DONATE: Dylan now has bursitis in his good right shoulder and had only 10% use of his left arm for 47-years. His health has greatly deteriorated in the past 2-years because of the endless duress. Here is my website:    denisethetutor.com  Dylan created this site for me 5-years ago, read my bio to follow my life adventuresI wanted to teach on the coast but was not sure from Brookings to Newport this is why Windy Bay, the location, I could teach and look for the right town up and down the coast. I have not worked in 1.6 years we have paid all our bills, but our savings is gone we have just 30-days to pack and move:1.     Dylan has desperately needed 2-operations on his feet as he cannot walk on concrete very long it’s very painful to walk he has plantar fasciitis on the right foot FROM THE REEDSPORT DR. BENNETT OPERATION and bones spurs on the left.He was waiting for me to move, but Jerry knows this, Dylan could not mow the yard without a pain pill. The eviction doesn’t pack boxes; it only compounds the 2-year cultural and personal harassment situation by Jerry and Kim Felgenhauer. Dylan's health is the main issue he just cannot do this hard job alone, anymore. Dylan will need a lot of assistance to pack a 26-foot truck and 12-foot trailer to move the 2500 miles back to Texas.2.     The truck, trailer, and gas (was $1300) are $4,500. Then, supplies of tape, bubble wrap for each painting, boxing the house then loading and the unloading is another $1000 no one works cheap and if they do they will break something. Dylan was unloading the U-Haul truck on July 3rd and 4th  when the truck was due. Of Course, Dylan had to go to businesses and asked people at Walmart for help, Dylan had NO CAR ... Once he started unloading the truck, the truck could not be moved.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to the US House of Representatives. Not only is she one of the least informed elected officials in American history, her nonsensical, socialist trope is spread worldwide daily by legacy and social media.  

In early 2019, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez (self-nicknamed ""AOC"") introduced her ""Green New Deal"", which promised to eliminate air travel and cow flatulence within the next decade. When the raucous laughter died down, her comrades in the Democrat Party realized that she was serious and were forced to go on the record as for or against this economic asteroid landing. So far, every declared Democrat candidate for president has endorsed the Green New Deal out of fear of becoming the target of AOC's newly found giant megaphone. 

Most recently, AOC took credit for torpedoing the planned Amazon headquarters in New York that would have created 25,000 high paying jobs in her district.  Even the far left wing governor of New York and mayor of New York City were for this project that she scared away. 

Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pulling her hair out trying to manage her new crop of House freshmen who cannot stop embarrassing her with their ill-informed, racist, and anti-Semitism public statements. There is already an effort to try and primary AOC in 2020, but the GOP cannot allow that to happen. We need AOC to not only stay in Congress, but also to remain the medias #1 darling so that her daily maniacal delusions stay on the front pages for years to come.  

GOP for AOC will donate proceeds either directly to AOC's campaign or to a PAC who supports her politically. The high command of the Democrat Party is already conspiring to get rid of AOC, so it's up to Republicans to protect the longevity of her career! Donate today and Keep America Great!"

As a senior software engineer, it was no difficult for me to make two proofs, as the contest instructed. I did it in the form of two useful computer programs that accurately predicted some common events that we observe in reality. It used data from the fact that the earth is a ball to:#1  Determine how much time passes from seeing sunset from the ground level versus from the observation deck of a skyscraper.#2 Determine how much mega-structure suspension bridge towers have to be further apart from each other at their tops versus their base despite being plumb line straight up and downif you want to read the two proofs, here are their documentations:Here are the links to the two proofs:http://www.arguemax.com/documents/edited_zen%20proof%20one.pdf http://www.arguemax.com/documents/ZEN%20PROOF%20TWO%202.pdf If you follow the steps in the document, you too can prove to anybody that the earth is really a ball.  The math involved in this is kind of complicated, I admit, but anyone can do it if they have the time.   There is a program that I use to do the math, but even if you do not understand C++,  you can look at the code and figure out how the math is done. It can be done with a sheet of paper and a pencil, but I made the effort to put it in a software program as a tool.  That originally this is was what computers were meant to do.  They were meant to compute.  Today when you say ""software"" one usually thinks of a tool like Microsoft Word or maybe a video game. But this is nothing like this.  Here, see for yourself.  They are just each one page of math:https://github.com/xarzu/Bridges---Part-1/blob/master/Bridge/Bridge.cpphttps://github.com/xarzu/Tower-Test/blob/master/TowerTest.cppHere is a summary of the one proofhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pI2Toqj1JwHere is a summary of the the other proofhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5wmg02l4S8&t=62s And if you would like me to read to you the whole proofs, I have this as well:Here is the first proofhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdjB15AFaTg&t=54sHere is the second proof:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSiYfsrfbcE&t=22sI satisfied the conditions of the contest.   But he did not pay up.  So I took him to small claims court.   The ""trial"" t was not as I had expected.  I guess I expected an episode of ""The People's Court"" where the judge sat and patiently asked questions. and pondered and got to the heart of the issue and chose wisely.   Perhaps I expected the judge to rely on what is considered common knowledge and simple high school algebra.    I do not want to say anything bad about the judge.   Frankly, I do not know what went wrong,   But maybe everything went right   Because now there is a new trial in Superior Court being conducted ""de novo"".   And according to Wikipedia:""In law, the expression trial de novo means a ""new trial"" by a different tribunal. A trial de novo is usually ordered by an appellate court when the original trial failed to make a determination in a manner dictated by law.""So now, I want to take this much more seriously and do this right.  I am told that no one is successful unless they first fail. this time, I have been roped into what I assumed would be a very easy win the first time around.If you do not think this is worth your participation, I do not know what to tell you.  The importance of fighting this is self-evident to me.  I am reminded of the great James Randi when he mused that he did not understand why everyone would want to debunk scams and guide people to the truth out of the darkness.This is really just a symptom of a much greater crisis.  This thing does not exist in countries that have the better education.  This only exists in countries where the standard of education is very poor.     Perhaps I could get some sort of educational grant, but I do not imagine that getting a grant would be likely.  More money should come from donations from the public.  No matter if you are Democrat or Republican, this is something that will make America actually great again because it just might end The Flat Earth Movement.  And, by the way,  maybe this is why China is killing us in trade and they have great education system.  I wonder if they would donate more money to us to help us out.   I have just come from China.  I was there about a month ago from the time I am writing this.  They do not waste their time hating their president.  They are focused on bettering their lives and the lives of their children.  Maybe more Americans should be like this.  Some of the Chinese I met acted more American than the vast majority of the Americans I know.And I lost 20 pounds there because I was eating the right kinds of foods.  So, how about this.  Instead of getting fast food one day, take that money you would otherwise spend and donate it to this instead.  It will be a wiser investment in your overall health knowing you have contributed to something good.This time around, I plan on subpoena some heavy hitters in the scientific community and get some news coverage.  Subpoenas can be expensive and sometimes the process can  cost only a few dollars.  So, literally, no amount is too small.  What you give could take us over the top and make a real difference.  Imagine of you-know-who gets on television and says, ""thankfully, we have actually done something to save the country from ruin"" and you can brag to all your friends that you played a part in making that happen.If you are Christian, you should really want to help out.  The Flat Earthers are using the literal interpretation  of scripture to support their cause.  If you do not believe me, have a look at the web site, http://www.geocentricity.com/  and their promotion of the idea that the earth is at the center of the universe mainly because the literal interpretation of the bible says it is. This can only make people stop going to church.  I know what you are probably thinking.  I was shocked to find a flyer this group mailed out once.What more can I say?  If you can think of anything, please tell me.How about this?  The Flat Earth Movement is very bad for kids.We are drawn to the trick of believing what makes us feel good and then find facts that support the belief that we have chosen to believe.It is called presupposition. And it is not good.  But it can make you feel good and so there is a kind of reward for thinking this way. I am talking about what is called the “pleasure and reward” system.  Often it is more comforting to find a way to stay convinced of something while it is uncomfortable to challenge it.  It is like a game our brains play where it is more important to be convincing than truthful.But here is why all this is important.   In the real world that we live in today, it is becoming increasingly urgent that people start thinking logically and they avoid this proverbial opiate of a way of thinking because it is damaging and it is especially damaging  to children.  Children naturally accept as truth whatever their authority figures tell them what is true. This is why this kind of hokum needs to be fought because it will get in the hands of children who will accept it as truth.A lie has a has a very particular characteristic that the truth does not have. A lie is information that will eventually lead to a dead-end. It will lead to a place where someone can end. It will lead to a place where someone can not further themselves.  The truth is exactly the opposite of that. The truth will open up doorways and lead to more and  more opportunities and more opportunities –– especially for young people.If you teach young people a lie (that a falsehood is true), you are, in a sense, harming them.   But you are harming them on an extremely deep level. You are limiting their capacity to have a meaningful and purposeful life. You are limiting their capacity to earn an income.  As far as the Flat Earth mindset is concerned, if you they happen to get this garbage in their brains at a young age, they will not have the critical thinking skills to compete in the high tech world they will be thrust into.   You are limiting their capacity to earn an income. And you are hurting the economy hurting the economy of this country as a result.  They will be denied the tools to compete on a world state where they will be facing off against people who were taught science and logic.There are other aspects of this I can mention, but this should be enough.The people I met in China were very honest, compassionate, helpful and giving.  Maybe they should help us out.  I will make this a friendly competition, let's go, Team USA!现在，我在这里向中国所有人发送信息。 向美国人民展示您对他们的关心，并帮助他们停止愚蠢和缺乏教育。 所有的钱都将花在阻止他们荒谬的平地运动上，并使他们脱颖而出。 奉献这一事业将帮助世界。 付出比接受更好。 您所提供的将团结世界。 它让我们向人民展示爱，同情和关怀。 然后我们的政府将效法我们I know a lot of people will say that the Flat Earth Movement is ""crazy"" and/or ""stupid"".  But please ask yourself.  What is worse: The Flat Earth Movement, or ignoring the opportunity to enlighten these people?"

My name is John Agnew, I am 74 years old, a lifelong resident ofChattooga County and a conservative Christian Republican.  I was the first elected Republican for school board in Chattooga since reconstruction (although one incumbent Democrat did switch to Republican that same election).  I was elected in 2016 to the Chattooga School Board defeating a well-established Democrat incumbent. My motive was, and still is, to provide the best education possible for our children.  Being the sole Republican on a 5-man school board , I was  never able to bring important motions to the floor for a vote. The board was simply a rubberstamp for the school superintendent.  Consequently there waslittle controversy because there were no in-depth discussions of the system.In 2018 three Democrat incumbents were up for election and three well-qualified Republicans stepped up to challenge the Democrats. The driving issue in the election was a return to a five-day school week which the Democrats, the school administration and many teachers opposed. The debate was public and intense lasting for several months. Election night all three Republicans won their seats on the ChattoogaSchool Board and I was elected Chairman by the new  Board. As with the 2016 Trump election and 2018 Kemp election the local Democrats (some of whom call themselves Republicans) refused to accept the election results.In January 2019, after the Board of Education members were sworn in, the personal attacks against all board members started immediately.   The current Republican Board members continue to be ridiculed and demonized by many on social media, demanding their  resignation and allowing their replacement  by the previous Democrat incumbents.Cassie Bryant and Allan Baggett,  started a recall effort to remove me from office. They would have attempted to recall the other Republican School Board members but I was the sole one in office for the required 180 days. The recall had no basis in fact, but I as an individual would have to bear the legal cost to fight the attack in court. The monetary cost was enormous but emotional cost has been worse. I could have resigned instead of fighting but allowing the Democrat tactics of bullying and intimidation to impose “mob rule” on our local government was not acceptable.  You are aware these tactics of personal attacks, public ridicule, and use of the legal system to financially punish Republicans who have the gallto win an election is being carried on at the National (Trump) and the State (Kemp) levels.  They are now being used against the most local of elected officials, the School Board.  This is everyone’s fight and I am asking you to join me.  Friends, I have been burdened with $9,701.53 in legal fees to defeat the unfounded recall petition and I need your help.  Any contribution will not only provide financial support but also give much needed emotional support by knowing I am not fighting alone.  I will certainly answer any questions you might have.  Thank you for your help in advance. Sincerely,John Agnew

The non profit I wish to create, is one that will help people rich and poor by incentivising TAX DEDUCTIBLE donations towards an organization that will help people in any way they need. There are 420 thousand plus people in my home town of Oakland, California as of now, and we are all paying taxes and fees to help run this city yet don't have say or the time to understand what our taxed income and tolled roads are used on. I want us all to use this non profit as our own, not mine, to do what we need for us to thrive. Need affordable childcare? You will be helped so you may go to school or work without worry and advance your life in whatever it is that makes you happy because nothing is better than being paid and surviving in life doing what you love. Do you use or drive for rideshare companies? Apps and programs will be created to help you earn more driving and have the payments made that you ""donate"" to these apps and programs help feed the non profit for further function that will help people and the environment. Wish your job paid you more? This non profit will use funds to create businesses known as cooperatives that will give you an actual piece of the pie made from the business. The non profit will generate more money through donations due to daily updates of goals achieved and weekly town halls with participants (any one interested in bettering the community in any way possible) to discuss community issues and how to solve them (potholes, garbage dumping, renewable energy, helping local businesses). I do not want money I simply want to help the economy and community. We are together worth tens and if working together well, hundreds of thousands of dollars a week to help ourselves and not depend on government. This non profit will also help and partner with other non profits aimed at helping the community of with knowledge and health for beautiful advancement. The best thing one can give is knowledge. The knowledge to advance in life in every way possible and its never too late to learn something neither is anyone too young to know the reality we are living in. We must take action not only for our future but for our children's. I take no sides not a Democrat or Republican. I consider myself a true independent. I am on the side of helping and loving anyone and everyone from all walks of life. Racism and hate isnt in our nature it is taught and pushed, dividing us all when we are all actually one. I hate no one and never will because everyone deserves love and happiness and the best way to provide that is through communication and understanding. I envy no one and wish everyone the best because everyone deserves to be happy as long as they hurt no one in the process. And i do not wish to hurt anyone in anyway ever on the contrary, I wish to help and bring everyone together to understand what life is about and its simple: To love one another and do whats right for ones self and everyone else. Point is. Anything is possible. And with this non profit, the goal is to increase everyone's quality of life by creating a real community determined to be independent and fruitful. Thank you.  A bit about myself: I am a young father and entrepenour driving for uber and lyft to raise funds and provide for my 5 year old son suffering seizures from a disease called tuberous sclerosis. "

Republic, Democrat, Liberal, Conservative, etc. These are dividing words toward a negative well-being. There is one thing every one of us have in common and that all will be subject to in the near future. That unity is in The God that allowed this Great country to flourish and grow to be the greatest success in the entire world. Trust that with my plan to recover every great thing that can be a blessing and benefit to all,  these I will not stop finding a more Christ like way of improvement. My overall mindset is the same as with my immagration reform plan. It is revolutionary to say the least and will be an economic support to our country. Showing the world that the American way, is not just that, but the way God would have it. Following the Golden rule will be the focus and the deciding factor toward success. That is why I NOW, RIGHT THIS SECOND, CHALLENGE YOU TO JUST PICK THE PHONE UP AND DIAL THIS NUMBER (903-707-6789) THAT WAY YOU AND I MAY SPEAK MORE FORMALLY. I will be leaving my apartment in Houston with the first dollar that comes in to support My daunting task of traveling state to state and connecting through prayer with the people that need to know the change that is coming. I will be podcasting and contacting local news stations and municipal offices to get the word out ahead of me. Won't you be part of the wave. This is a calling to all God-fearing and the unknowing alike. In the name of Jesus, I ask for help today to achieve our goals, needs, and to rebuild this great nation for the better of all people, foreign and domestic alike. My focus is on a common respect that all of us working men and women deserve. I dont know how much it will cost to see myself in the commander and chief seat, praying with and for our great nation every day like a true patriot and leader ought to do. Your support will go to positive marketing, fuel and boarding along the way. I am a servant-leader with values and morals. Such as relwards for EXECUTION. That Getting things done. It is in the blood that flows through these veins. A larger amount of knowledge to work with toward to help develop Our that is (We The People's) futher growth, is what I'm truly about. From a better design to the education this country provides it's young leaders of tomorrow. To the type of energy and food the we are subject to on a daily basis. Change is inevitable. Let us embrace a calling and trove undauntingly to a victory for the Lord and ALL OF HIS PEOPLE. IT IS TIME TO BECOME OVERCOMERS! To Unite in Truth. To give up old ways and new ways alike and focus on God's will for this great nation. It is our duty to support social change and let our voices be heard. Roar with your support and spread the Good news, that is the calling unto your Loyal American God loving hearts. Lord this pray I pray in Jesus's name and I in the name of Krist ask your blessing to proceed in your will and thank you for answering with all the support your children are to provide to usher in this revolution. Amen Where do we live? Between the wings!

-The recuperation of funds borrowed for the cost of the remaining balance of Kelly's cremation, which was $1,200.

$3,000.00These funds will be used by me personally to pay for overdue repairs to my car, get my tags current, pay for car insurance, and to pay the two citations I received for the previous two items.  Any remaining funds after those expenses are paid will be set aside to pay my health insurance premium (I am losing my subsidy because I don’t make enough money to escape the “income gap”) and cover the co-payments for therapy appointments.Bonus:  $3,000+If funds are raised in excess of the $3,000.00 goal, I will set them aside for living expenses and to cover future insurance/medical costs.About Me:My name is Robert.  I am a 36 year old political consultant and attorney living and working in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  My firm, Rainmaker Strategies works with progressive candidates for public office, particularly the Oklahoma State Legislature.  I have a bachelor’s degree in Political Science from the University of Oklahoma and a Juris Doctor from the University of Arkansas.  In between undergraduate and law school, I obtained an associate’s degree in Culinary Arts from a for-profit school affiliated with Le Cordon Bleu in Austin, Texas that is no longer in business.  Despite my significant education, I graduated from culinary school at the height of the 2008 recession and struggled to find a job paying a living wage.  I graduated with my law degree in 2013 and immediately fell into a legal job market with fierce competition for the few jobs available.  I was lucky enough to join a small Tulsa firm and practiced bankruptcy law, though at a wage far below what the general public assumes an attorney earns.  Frankly, I felt lucky to have any job.Since moving back to Tulsa, I got involved with the Tulsa County Democratic Party and various Democratic candidates.  I started as a Young Democrat and volunteer, working hard to be accepted into the Democratic community.  In 2018, after a long period of decreased hours at my law job, and at the urging of several friends, I took on work as a paid political consultant and campaign manager.  I learned an incredible amount during that year, including what I was capable of, and what my limits are.  I also learned that campaign work, while extraordinarily important and enjoyable, does not pay well.  In fact, it often pays nothing, which leads me to this unfortunate situation.  In 2019, I managed the campaign of Alicia Andrews for Oklahoma Democratic Party Chair and shortly thereafter, formed Rainmaker Strategies with my business partner to continue to represent and assist candidates seeking to make Oklahoma a better place to live.  While I believe that Rainmaker can be built into a profitable enterprise that affords me a living wage and the ability to help candidates, it is not there yet.  That, in large part, is the reason for the first goal.  While I have taken legal work on the side as often as I can get it, I was essentially unemployed from November 2018 to July of 2019 and barely scraping by (or, as with my car insurance and tags, not scraping by at all).  While Rainmaker now has clients, our earning potential is directly tied to our fundraising ability, and that requires the technology I mentioned in Goal #1.  Some have inquired as to why I have not gotten another full time legal position.  The answer to that is that I have tried to do so, but have not gotten so much as an interview in months.  This is compounded by the fact that I suffer from multiple mental health conditions including general anxiety, depression, ADD, and high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder, conditions that can make even everyday tasks feel like climbing a mountain.Those same conditions also make it incredibly difficult to ask for help.  One of my primary defense mechanisms against my own mental illness is helping others.  Going the other way and reaching out to the community for help, especially in this way, is not in my nature.  Frankly, I find it embarrassing, frustrating, and anxiety causing, but I find myself in a place where I simply don’t have a choice.  Rainmaker needs the tech if it is going to be a functioning concern and I simply must get my vehicle situation sorted out, because if I can’t drive, I can’t work.For those of who you make a contribution or considered doing so, I’d like to express my deep and sincere gratitude.  I know that many of you are struggling in these difficult times, be it emotionally, financially, medically, or politically (or all of the above!).  Your generosity is seen and appreciated more than I can ever express.  And even if you made it to the end of this, but aren’t in a position to donate, thank you for your time.  It means a lot to me.  Sincerely,Robert Goins"

St. Clair County Coroner Calvin Dye’s office said a cause of death has not been determined and that the toxicology and autopsy results may not be available for up to a year. Family and friends, however, believe the Belleville woman overdosed on heroin.“She was a direct casualty of the opioid epidemic,” Lauren Anthony, McDannel’s friend of more than 15 years said. “But she wasn’t just some addict. She had her addiction, but she was a good person, too.”Anthony and McDannel met in McDannel’s hometown of Burlington, Iowa, when Anthony, who is originally from the metro-east, was placed there for a training. She was managing a steakhouse there and hired McDannel.At some point, the “bubbly” blonde McDannel asked Anthony where she was staying during the training period, and when Anthony told her, McDannel said she’d come by to say hello.“I didn’t think she would stop by, but she did,” Anthony recalled, laughing. “She came with her child and her dog, and we’ve been friends since that moment.”McDannel was a mother to three boys. Her sons — ages 17, 14 and 10 — are in the care of McDannel’s aunt. Their father, McDannel’s ex-boyfriend, died of a drug overdose in Burlington eight years ago, Anthony said.Though McDannel’s sons had been in and out of her care for years as she battled her addiction, Anthony said her love for them was never a question.“She wanted what was best for them, and would always do what was best for them,” Anthony said.Anthony described her friend as a fun-loving person with an extroverted personality.“She didn’t have anybody that was her enemy,” Anthony said of McDannel. “She got along with anyone, and maybe trusted too many people.”BEHIND OUR REPORTINGWhy we did this storyThe Belleville News-Democrat is telling Lacey McDannel’s story in an effort to profile the person behind the addiction and possibly serve a cautionary tale to those who share her struggle.Growing up in Burlington, McDannel made friends everywhere she went, Nichols said.“She was the pretty, popular girl in school that everyone was jealous of, but she had a heart of gold,” Nichols said of her cousin. “We have been though everything together.”Nichols, who now lives in Macon, Georgia, remembered how she and her cousin would go to the zoo together as kids, or play dress-up and pretend they were beauty queens.“We did everything together,” Nichols said. “When we got older, that included drugs.”Nichols has now been sober for three years, she said, crediting a 12-step program and having a sponsor. She said she tried to persuade McDannel to do the same.“There’s not a pill that fixes it and makes (addiction) go away,” Nichols said. “I chose that life and I chose to get out of that life. I know if I go back out to it, I’ll be where Lacey is now.”According to Nichols and Anthony, McDannel’s opioid addiction began with prescription pills while growing up in Iowa. It eventually snowballed to heroin.“Once she tried heroin, she couldn’t fight it,” Anthony said. “She had been through many rock bottoms.”Anthony recalled the times she would have to buy diapers and formula for McDannel’s sons when they were babies, or drive up to Iowa in the middle of the night to help her friend. She said McDannel finally moved to the metro-east in “a state of emergency” in 2008. She had been living with Anthony for the last five months of her life.Though Anthony did not approve of McDannel’s drug use, she understood her friend’s struggle, and said it didn’t prevent them from having a close bond. Anthony said she is working with McDannel’s relatives to plan funeral arrangements.“She didn’t choose to be an addict,” Anthony said. “She fought addiction and she loved us.”According to the coroner’s office, there were 54 deaths caused by overdoses in St. Clair County in 2018.Nichols said her cousin was more than just her addiction.“She really was a good person, she just had some demons,” Nichols said. “Some deal with their demons better than others.”McDannel’s funeral will be Friday, Nov. 22, at Serenity Memorial Chapel in Belleville from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. HANA MUSLIC618-239-2626Hana Muslic has been a public safety reporter for the Belleville News-Democrat since August 2018, covering everything from crime and courts to accidents, fires and natural disasters.

Hello ladies and gentlemen. I am Redpill Ken and I am asking for the people to support my efforts to leave NYC, which has become much too expensive and unsafe because of policies which has forced me no other choice but to leave NYC. I feel unsafe where I am living within a sanctuary city. And I am a huge Trump fan and I consider myself a citizen journalist, as our MSM has been caught with exposing themselves as being enemy to We The People. Since I began to streaming on YouTube, I have already been given a strike and removed for a week for citizens journalism on platforms like YouTube and just given my opinion of what is called open source news. That news involved Ray Chandler. However that is Free Speech, and there is an attack of our 1st amendment right. Running away from the ideology of a party which will attempt to abort full term to a communist mayor which would tell American people ""that say the word illegal alien"" would cost us a 250,000,00 fine is policies which does not fit my own. To those interested in my move to the Carolina's, there it is much more affordable, and they respect my God Given Right to protect myself against a traitorously government or deep state communist like NYC mayor. Mr Meatless Mondays, Bill Deblassio and democrat ideology. Thank you for hearing my story. My original Go Fund Me was opened in Canada. It was not accepting prior attempts to donate to that account due to that issue. I decided to close that account which a Patriot took time and set up to help me and my effort.

I am seeking to further enrich my education in this field of interest by learning from the worlds experts:From the Carnegie Endowment’s Website :“International efforts to reduce nuclear risks are in deep turmoil. As we approach the thirtieth anniversary of the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference, rising tensions among nuclear powers, technological developments, and doctrinal innovations are increasing the likelihood of nuclear use. The Iran deal faces serious challenges that could lead to its collapse. Perhaps the only bright spot is the Korean Peninsula, where a spike in threats in 2017 gave way to renewed hopes for peace in 2018. Meanwhile, a global effort to eliminate nuclear weapons—embodied in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons—is increasing strains between the nuclear haves and have-nots.We hope you will join over 800 experts and officials from more than forty-five countries and international organizations to debate—and explore solutions for—the most pressing challenges in nuclear nonproliferation, arms control, disarmament, deterrence, energy, and security.”At the same time, I will be attending Advance Camp with the Simpson College Democrats! Advance Camp is a networking and training conference for anyone interested in political optics and operations for Democratic campaigns on the national level, in preparation for the exciting 2020 Presidential campaign cycle.

My name's Hugo, I'm a 17 year old A-Level student studying Maths, Chemistry, and History at Burford Academy. I'm really looking forward to university. I'm excited not only to make new friends but for the first time in my life I'm going to be living truly independently. I'll be taking care of myself, organising my own timetable, and studying a subject I want to spend the rest of my life doing. That's where my problem starts, and where you come in to help! I'm not really sure on what I want to study and where I want to study it. I've narrowed it down to three of the subjects I'm most interested in: Law, Chemistry, and History; and six universities: Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Glasgow, York, or St. Andrews. Although Law is my preferred route, I want to explore a wide range of curricula and keep my options open as something might catch my eye and capture my passion.The problem is that this is all really expensive. My mum and I would have to travel over 2,100 miles (or 3,380 km) and pay for a total of nine night's accommodation:Petrol Cost:                                 £715.00Accommodation:                     £1350.00That's why I'm asking if you could help me raise £2,250.

I love stories, and I love listening to other people tell theirs' as well as telling them myself. It is who I am. It's because of this that I want to become an MP. I want to help the people left behind by the rest of society, the people who haven't been given the opportunity to live their dream and tell it to the rest of the world. I have felt like this ever since I took part in the theatre production More in Common (which some of you may have donated to), which was about homelessness. There is nothing that I am more passionate about than poverty. I am already so far, despite being so young,  the Membership Secretary for the Witney Liberal Democrats, managing over 350 members in my free time; and I don't want to stop my political career there.The way I see it, any one of these three subjects could take me many steps closer towards that goal. History is one of the most important things to learn about. Studying where we have come from is vital to contemplating where we should be going. With Chemistry, I can help save our planet through greater knowledge about our climate and the changes its experiencing, so that I may dispel ignorance. Law would give me a greater understanding of how our country functions, and allow me to really tap into my potential for public speaking. Please donate so that I may live my dream, whatever route I decide to take.Thank you!Hugo"

What better way to discuss legalization of marijuana and healthcare than film! We want to shoot ""Pharms"" and explore these issues in the city that represents them best: San Francisco. The film's crew and equipment are already funded! Your help will allow us to cover other expenses needed to shoot the story! Short SummaryThis is an independent project with an international production crew! We are a group of filmmakers via a locally run San Francisco film co-op called, Scary Cow. (See Below) ""Pharms"" was pitched to over 100 members of the co-op and garnered interest by a full crew's worth of renowned long-standing members as well as freshcomers.""Pharms"" is a unique short film that deals with the very relatable (and-all-too-pertinent-in-the-U.S.) topic of healthcare and treatment options.As a contributor, you are helping generate productive dialogue between two extreme views. You are also helping support a medium that fosters understanding, tolerance and inspiration.About the Film""Pharms"" is about two siblings who try to navigate an increasingly subjective world and find a solution to illness despite their opposing beliefs in pharmaceuticals and alternative medicine.  It is a psychedelic dramedy saturated with visual and musical splendor. What We Need & What You GetWe want to raise $4,000.Not only will you get personally involved in the making of an intimately told story about two San Franciscan natives, but you will also qualify to be awarded some of our unique perks as well as neat add-on perks, ""Pharms"" swag.The total funds raised will pay our actors (as most projects in San Francisco don't pay actors adequately if you can believe it) craft service (a.k.a. food for the entire crew,) location fees, insurance, props, costumes, make-up artist and other miscellaneous expenses. It takes a village! The ImpactWhat if someone you love has a dangerous disease and the way they plan to cure themselves makes no sense to you? This project explores different perspectives of health, happiness and how empathy can help us improve our personal relationships.While more states are legalizing marijuana and other psychoactive, albeit natural, substances, major pharmaceutical companies still maintain their stronghold over mainstream American ethos when it comes to health care. Take a pill or smoke a joint? Is there a right or wrong way to approach healthcare or is it somewhere in between? Is a ""between"" possible amidst our binary society where democrats meet republicans, gay meets straight, or conservationism meets mass consumerism?This film depicts how it feels, within a spectrum of views, to give in to our prejudices clouded by biases, passive conditioning and social as well as academic education even in their most subtle forms and patterns.While these topics are heavy, ""Pharms"" highlights these aspects we all experience with a quirky, alternate-reality twist. About Scary CowScary Cow is a collectively run film company with members from the Bay Area with several screenings a year at the Castro Theater in San Francisco. Almost 70% of Scary Cow films have gone on to be screened at well known festivals such as Slamdance, Palm Springs, SF Indie Fest, and many more.http://www.scarycow.com Risks & StrengthsWhile Scary Cow is a volunteer organization and we will be drawing many of our resources from a collective effort, we can face challenges related to all aspects of film making. Every film has challenges.Many crew members are learning new skills in their roles so learning curves are a natural part of the process. Luckily, the crew on this project in particular happens to draw from Scary Cow's more notable and seasoned filmmakers. This means almost all new to the crew have a mentor. Our cinematographer, Bob Sitzwohl, for example, has a Film Theory and History degree from SFSU and worked in the industry as a gaffer on high end marketing and commercial pieces. After thirty years, he's been a Director of Photography and has won Best Cinematography awards from past Scary Cow screenings. Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute monetarily, but that doesn't mean you can't help us!You can always help us by sharing this link with family and friends who love independent films, San Francisco, those that have opinions about healthcare, life and love to smoke the chronic! (Well, this being a non-biased film, we're not beyond cheap laughs.)And that's all there is to it. About the short's creator, Molly McGivern (in her own words)I am an S.F. native with Hawaiian-Portuguese and Irish decent and a B.A. in Psychology from McGill University and recently moved back from New York. I have a ranging span of credits on ABC's ""Lost"" as ""Rosie,"" (actor) ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (crew), and smaller credits from the underground theatres of Montreal, New York, San Francisco and the historic Aloha Theatre in Hawaii as actor, writer and composer. I find myself trying new things, getting into trouble, curating lifestyles with each relocation and distilling authenticity like a thespianologist. I sing, play violin and other instruments, compose, surf, knit, make things, travel a lot, lived and volunteered globally and have won awards on some of my productions along the way. Themes have included implied dialogue, dreams, as above so below and also a choose-your-own adventure inter-galactic travel piece for the children's series of Montreal's Centaur Theatre. It was beyond an honor to have collaborated with the late Brazilian dramatist and creator of ""Theatre of the Oppressed"" and ""Invisible Theatre,"" Augusto Boal at NYU. In Romania, I joined English Dramatherapy pioneer, Dr. Sue Jennings, and directed a play with Roma children inspiring tolerance among their communities. I drew from theatre and music as a medium in Hawaii's public schools and Mongolia, for educating orphaned children and those on the spectrum as well as family enrichment programs. Random ""day jobs"" I've explored ranged from macadamia nut and coffee farm manager to stage technician and to full-blown custodian at Montreal's indie music hub, Casa del Popolo. I hope these tidbits provide a glimpse of my explorative nature and ""qualifications"" as a fund-worthy storyteller and story-doer. These experiences have helped me conceptualize ""Pharms"" and set an intention for its purpose as a short film with wings."

A native of  Brussels, Belgium, I have lived in Los Angeles, CA since 2009 and observed the rapid changes in the political and social landscape within the United States.  I notice a lot of division, one year from the 2020 Presidential election.  During my project, ""What is your truth?"" across the faces of America, I will interview a large spectrum of individuals with the same questions. Deep questions that we are not used to asking or being asked: Who are you? What is your story? What brings you joy? What is your biggest fear? What are you proud of? Are you angry about something? Will you vote in 2020? Do you believe in something? What is the truth? What is your truth? In addition, as an Educator, I am delighted to give inspirational talks in schools and also interview personalities about the topic, along the way. The upcoming Presidential election is critical, and I felt it important that I begin my solo journey immediately. However, I don’t talk about politics with my interviewees nor are my questions focused on it. My intention is to show that beyond politics and all our differences, there is something much bigger that unifies us all. Could it be a truth that we can agree on?Friends, the truth can be frightening. I tried to secure funding: however, the media, production, and publishing companies I approached said there were no budgets to support my work or space to publish my interviews. On October 6th, without waiting for any hypothetical contribution, I left Los Angeles with $250 given by two generous donors who urged me to start this daring adventure. That implies no car, no budget, just a heavy backpack, a laptop and an iPhone. I am confident that all I need will be provided during my travels across the United States. From Los Angeles, CA to Albuquerque, NM to Kansas City, MO, then Des Moines, IO, Chicago, Il and now Pittsburgh, PA, I have already interviewed more than 40 individuals and have seen kindness and generosity in the people that I’ve met. My next destinations include Washington DC, Virginia, Kentucky, New Orleans, Texas and Arizona. My hope is to gain media attention and interest in ""What is your truth?"" and to collaborate on a professional documentary in 2020 with full equipment, crew and budget.I need your support to cover my expenses for the first part of this endeavor. Although some people I meet will host and feed me, I still have expenses for transportation, food, and miscellaneous items (e.g., equipment for the project), and I must cover my expenses at home. I plan to travel for three months, and $7,500 is a fair estimate for the funding I need. I’m immensely grateful for your support. Warmly, Sophie.First reviews : Tara Burgoyne, producer in Los Angeles, CAHi Sophie, I watched a few of your interviews, there's something about all of them that keeps you watching... you are capturing people and where they are at that very moment. I love the rawness and vulnerability you are bringing out of them. Above all, it feels like from my perspective that people just want to be seen and heard, they want to know they have a voice, they exist, above all, they want to feel connected to something and someone. I love that you are not editing any of them because it's often in the silent moments where the audience can see so much in the look on a face. For eg. Erick's interview was so fragile, he was clearly grieving the death of his mother, it was written all over his face, he was at times barely holding it together. I truly felt his grief, his sadness. Anyway, just wanted to send that out to you, this was all my perspective, of course, just thought I'd share. Keep going. I love that you are doing this... what an experience for you. Be safe. Lots of love.

Hello, anyone and everyone. My name is Ian Bell, a soon-to-be college freshman at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. On December 19th, 2018, I was accepted to the College of Literature, Sciences, and the Arts (LSA) and was given an 'estimated financial aid package' that made my total cost of attendance to be around $10,000. Given that my father had recently become unemployed, I was ecstatic at the almost 85% coverage that the package had; although any cost of attendance would not be affordable for me and my family, I, at least, would not have to take out such a huge loan for such an amazing educational opportunity. Then, the unthinkable happened. Soon after I committed to UMich, my 'Official Award Notice' came to our attention via a phone call with the Financial Aid Office. Since I was currently attending the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts (ASMSA)-- a rigorous, public, residential high school in Hot Springs, AR--, I was unable to talk to the financial aid office myself and heard the news second-hand from my mother, and, let's just say, that was not my best week for me. The initial reason for the phone call was my curiosity in seeing if there was any possibility for an increase in my financial aid, with my recent receipt of the prestigious Arkansas Governor's Distinguish Scholarship of $10,000. The actual news I received then is similar to the news I recently received this past week, which was my financial aid package being dramatically reduced, making my total cost around $37,000 (subsidized & unsubsidized loans included). The recent news regarded my appeal for more financial aid, which unfortunately only increased my aid by $1,000.I have since applied for a plethora of scholarships to make some sort of dent in such a hefty price tag, given the commitment I made to the University and the timing of such news, but have received no such luck. However, I have been making progress toward working on this situation myself, luckily receiving an amazing, paid summer research internship at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). Although it will not even begin to cover the cost, at least it will pay for the flights to Ann Arbor in the fall (with good research experience being an added benefit-- we're analyzing a possible therapy for breast cancer right now!) In short, I am in a very precarious situation; I am scared and have begged the question, ""Why am I in such a set of unfortunate events?"" multiple times. In the future, I hope to work for the Center for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, or UNICEF as an Infectious Disease Specialist/Researcher, which will be enormously helped by an education at UMich (which explains my unwavering desire to make this work). Although I do not feel entitled to better financial circumstances, I just hate how it seems like all my hard work these past four years is being put to waste. 

For qualification's sake, at ASMSA, I was a Student Ambassador, Human Rights Club President, Non-Profit Henna Art Club ""Henna 4 Help"" Vice President, Young Democrats Secretary, and Interact Public Relations Officer. Academically, my ACT is 33, my weighted GPA is 4.30, and my unweighted GPA: 3.93. Anything will help, thank you for listening to my story.

The next time someone asks why people don’t volunteer anymore, we should all point to this case and say that it’s true that no good deed goes unpunished. Who in their right minds would want to perform good deeds when the payback is jailhouse bologna sandwiches and years of wearing prison scrubs in the most hideous colors imaginable? Rewinding to April 2018, Switalla was among a number of folks with the county government who checked out the property on Webb Street in Wittenberg that the county acquired. He offered to clean some of the garbage off the property, and among the trash was a grill. Switalla removed said grill, prompting ire from county officials, so he returned it. That should have been the end of the story, but the county decided to make Switalla the poster child for why you should never try to take something from the government. The property had been returned, and yet the county still wanted to label Switalla a thief. Let’s look at the wasted man- hours — the time spent investigating the matter, the time spent on appointing a special prosecutor because having a Shawano County district attorney trying to lock up a county supervisor is a conflict of interest, and the time spent in court for what was ultimately something that could have been resolved with a stern warning from the county. What was the end result? Deferred prosecution and 40 hours of com- munity service. Yep. That’s an efficient use of our taxpayer dollars. Why don’t we try to score death sentences for jay- walkers while we’re at it? The grill in question was de- scribed in Leader news stories as “rotten out” and garbage. Outside estimates put the value of the grill at $2 to $2.50, but County Treasurer Deb Wallace claimed it was worth $100. Maybe in mint condition, but if trash was really worth money, we’d all be sending our broken furniture, appliances and other large items to a recycling center instead of the landfill. Many of the major players in this melodrama, even the special prosecutor, Michael Balskus, agree that Switalla did not use the best judgment by removing trash before offically getting the county’s blessing, but that what he did was not a criminal offense. How has justice been served by dragging this through the courts? How many other counties or municipalities would go to this extreme over something that was ultimately returned? The case would probably still be going on — Switalla and his attorney were originally asking for a jury trial — had the two sides not come to an agreement. Could you imagine the testimony that would have taken place, the strange logic county officials like Wallace would have used to justify the need to throw someone in prison for property that Switalla had returned?  What would have happened if, in some bizarro world, Switalla had been convicted? Forget the prison sentence for a moment and realize that, with a felony count, he would have lost his county seat and his position as president of the Wittenberg Village Board, since felons cannot serve in elected positions. I realize Switalla’s a Democrat in a county considered a Republican stronghold, but is a junk grill worth destroying someone’s political ambitions?"

Therefore, you cannot trust any of the establishment parties - that’s why I’m standing in this election!I’m the only candidate that demands a REAL Brexit!Boris Johnson’s appeasement has emboldened the European Union, making it think that we don’t have a backbone.As explained in the video, the UK needs a simple trade deal with the EU — without political union.We should say to the EU: What tariffs do you want to put on our exports to you? If it’s 10%, then we will put 10% on your exports, and if it’s 20%, then we will put 20% on your exports to us.The UK is the largest export market for the European Union.We pay £1bn a month for the ‘privilege’ of running up a colossal £80bn trade deficit with the EU.So, a trade war would hurt them more than it hurts us.The solution is a zero % tariff rate, which would solve the Irish border problem.However, the European Union will only agree to this if we have ‘regulatory alignment’. In other words, they want us to have automatic alignment with EU rules on social security, the environment, state aid, immigration, and a whole host of other regulations. It’s all part of the European Union’s desire to create a European Empire, which is hell-bent on destroying the sovereignty of all member nations.We should tell the EU that the integrity of the UK is not open for negotiation, and we don’t want ‘regulatory alignment’ — a euphemism for political union. So, Boris Johnson’s deal is not a real Brexit — it’s a Brexit in name only.Let’s have a real Brexit and use the £39bn saved to help the NHS and eradicate poverty in the UK.Thank you,David Furness"

After talking with my family, and my doctors, I made the decision to have surgery to remove the malignant tumor. My life changed forever.Thinking I had dodged a bullet, I returned to work. In November, during my last Young Democrats of America meeting (I did not know that at the time) I received a call that confirmed my worst fear. The cancer had spread to my lung and lymph nodes. I returned to Salt Lake City, confused and demoralized. In January, I made the decision to take medical leave, undergo an aggressive form of chemotherapy, and fight for my life. Today I am happy to say that I’m in remission, and there doesn’t seem to be any sign of cancer in my body. My battle with cancer and the chemotherapy after, have forever changed me. My battle is not yet over.For my 32nd Birthday, I’m going to focus on my own health. Any funds raised will go to me in aid of that quest. I’m planning on focusing on my mental health and psychical health. I’m choosing to focus on this aspect of my life not because there aren’t deserving organizations out there, but because the chemo in my body is going to take a long time to be expelled. It’s toxic nature is slowing me down, and the only way to fight it, is to stay active, and engaged. Lastly, I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out over my yearlong battle with Cancer. My friends and family have been amazing pillars of support. You have helped guide me though the loss of my father, my life long battle with Fabry Disease, and now my battle with cancer. You have helped me pursue my dreams in fighting for a more just world, and held me accountable when I have strayed. You continue to be a source of inspiration and strength when times have looked dark. Thank you! Your friendship is the only gift I need this birthday. But just in case you have money to spare, feel free to help pay for my next year gym membership."

We are young black conservatives looking to inspire change in the black community. We believe the Democratic Party has taken advantage of our community and we want to put an end to it. Through their various social programs, they incentivize the removal of the father from the home. They’ve also prioritized illegals above the black community, and even worse, they promote the mass killing of black babies through ABORTION! We believe that conservative values are the right values. We believe in low taxes, limited government, the second amendment, protecting the life of the unborn, and much more. Also, President Trump has done tremendous work for the black community through criminal justice reform, the urban revitalization act, opportunity zones, HBCU funding, and so much more. We are well aware that the facts are on our side, but this battle isn’t easy. Black people are prideful people and we often face attacks from the left. We are called “coons,” “boot lickers,” “Uncle Tom,” and much more but still, we press on. But we need your help. Please understand that we travel to HBCU’S, forums, summits, low income neighborhoods, and more in an attempt to spread conservative values to a community that doesn't ever hear about them. These trips are costly and with Charrise still in school, financially it is not easy to always travel. Any donation you give will go towards this cause. If you follow us on social media than you are already aware of the work we’ve been doing. If you don’t follow us, we encourage you to do so (pages are below). This is the best way to know your donation is going to a good cause! So we ask you to give only what you can if you believe in the values we shared above. The Democratic Party can’t afford to lose any of the black vote. Even a 10% shift would cause them to lose almost every election. So be part of the journey of freeing our people from the grip the democrats have had on our community for years!Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. #KAG #MAGA #BLEXIT-Pierre and CharriseInstagram: @CharriseLane @PierreNWilsonTwitter: @CharriseLane @ThePierreWilsonFacebook: Charrise Lane Pierre N.

Our campus did a 9/11 Memorial last year and it was very successful.

Beginning in 1998 I began authoring books on money, economics, history, politics, social issues and even an autobiography. In the last 21-years I have written over 25 books and countless articles. I am a regular contributor to The Nationalist Times, wrote the editorials for The Sovereign for ten years, and am a regular contributor to numerous publications in Europe as well as America. I do all my own research, and have foretold the disadvantages of NAFTA and other poor trade deals in 1992 when it was enacted as an EO. My company A2Z Publications LLC is a labor of love for my adopted America and the education of her citizens; I am a legal immigrant from Switzerland. I realized back in the 80’s that things were going in the wrong direction for our country. We were heading for socialism, having been brought up during WWII in Switzerland; I am very familiar with this failed economic system, which invariably ends as a totalitarian dictatorship. The new Democrats call it progressive, which is nothing but another word for socialist. My company’s problem relates about the fact that even though we have sold over 100,000 books over 20-years, A2Z Publications LLC has never been profitable.Last spring our printers Lighting Source canceled our 17-year longstanding contract, which required us to find a new printer, which we were able to do, but at increased cost. Then the hammer was dropped, when Ingram the largest in the world, book distribution company also canceled our agreed contract; as usual in other similar cases, neither company gave any rational reason for the 30-day cancellations. This created a situation that structurally eliminated our ability to sell books outside America. You see; books are too expensive to ship overseas $22.40 for one book to the EU. Lighting Source has printing plants in England and Australia those markets are now closed to us. In one move publication and distribution eliminated half of our market-potential. Ingram listed all our titles that were then entered into the book-distribution sites used by booksellers; by canceling our agreement Ingram blocked our listings in the retail trade.I am now over 80-years of age, and would like to be able to advertise the books widely, this is not affordable for A2Z. I would like you to consider funding A2Z, anyone who funds with over $40, will on request be given an autographed book of their choice from the available list on our site: www.a2zpublications.com *(excluding Before Departing)As a veteran of the U.S. army and patriot, I hope you can consider funding us. All funds will be used for advertising books in various pro-American publications and to fund direct mail and e-mail information to potential buyers. Our detractors like SPLC have spared no effort to slander my name and have labeled A2Z a hate Group—it is a corporation, not a group, which has never inferred hate against anyone or anything.How will I know that funds will be used as claimed? I have been in business for over 50-years and have never cheated anyone. 100% of any monies donated will be used as directed on this page.A2Z Publications LLC is a legitimate Nevada corporation.

I am studying the social and psychological factors that influence political polarization for my dissertation. America has become more polarized than ever and this continues to grow at an unsustainable rate. My research will consist of two experiments. The first will determine if increasing self-esteem can decrease negative feelings for the political outgroup and also make partisans process information more objectively. The second study will collect data on the types of people Democrats and Republicans talk to and then assess what components of personal discussion networks are associated with reduced polarization. The goals of the project are to expand academic knowledge, but also generate possible ways to reduce polarization.I will be collecting data from Democrats and Republicans online. I will pay them to participate in my study and there will be a total of 580 participants. The total cost to pay them is $1,202. I also need to purchase a student subscription to Qualtrics software so I can run my experiments online. This costs $95 and brings the total to $1,297. Thankfully, I received a $1,000 research award from my department so I only need to cover the remaining $297.I will definitely share the results of my work with the public once I am done! I aim to collect data by the end of October 2019, write up my findings in my dissertation during the next few months, and then finish my PhD by the summer of 2020. Here is my website to check out my previous research and other work.

With that being said let me grab my cardboard, marker, and begin this story. Like a lot of people I have a family and things get expensive and the more your family grows the more expensive things get.   I am living the American dream. I have a house, a car, a loving family and a job that for the most parts keeps the bills paid.  You see this and may be wondering why I would start a campaign if my family is relatively healthy and I don’t need a transplant at the current moment.   The truth is I want to pay off everything and retire.   Please keep reading it gets better and I explain my retirement plan with your money.  Later I’ll explain why you should donate.If this his campaign makes it to $100,000 I’ll pay off what is left on my house and other debt I have. At $200,000 I’ll pay everything off and remodel the house and buy the wife a new suv to fit the growing family.  We got another kid on the way. It seems like the only think I know to pull out is money from the bank account. If if this makes it into the million range I’ll get me a financial adviser and invest it. If this hits the goal of $5,000,000 then I will retire from my current place of employment in a manner that many people will find inspirational and awesome and in a way that they wish they could leave their job.  If this thing blows up and surpasses the goal and hits $10,000,000 then things get real stupid. After making sure I’ve got my finances taken care of then it’s  Lamborghini top speed through a pasture drop half a million on a house party  kind of stupid.   I’ll also open a couple different small business ideas I have. I’ll also have a monument to the greatest dog that ever made it into my life built. I’m talking a big, annoy the neighbors size monument.Ill probably even go around the world eating all kinds of food and fill my Pokédex on Pokémon go.Now for the why you should donate. If if you want to see someone do something amazing and stupid chunk a couple dollars this way. If if you cheated on your spouse and want to get the guilt off your chest donate and leave an anonymous comment, I won’t judge you. If you are a republican think of it as investing in a new business that you might one day shop at. If you’re a democrat think of it as spreading the wealth and helping out someone.If you like sloths throw some money my way, because with this amount of money it doesn’t matter how many times my wife says no I’m buying that damn sloth.Pretty much give me some money and put whatever crazy thing you want in the comment section . If you love trees say it. If you hate koalas use the comment section to spew your hatred for the misunderstood marsupial If 1,000,000 people donate $5.00 then the goal is reached. If $5,000,000 donate $5.00 then this will become the most successful go fund me to this date. Alright internet let’s see if we can get to lambo in a pasture levels or just me retiring early. And if this gets to the goal don’t worry I’ll bring y’all along for the resignation."

Will you help me to continue to be one?And, thereby, I will do more for you than any person you don't know.Of my bona fides for being intelligent, people usually think I am a liar. Why? I tell them that I graduated from the largest university in Illinois cum laude in two years. One semester, I ace'd 24 hours. (transcript ) I set a similar record in the US Navy's electronic school. My record final score contributed to my assignment to help maintain one of the first two cell phones They were for the US President to conduct war. At nineteen, I was the youngest of 88 ET's tasked with the job.When people read my resume, they again think I am a liar. Wrong ""L""-word. Right ""L""-word: Lucky! I was gifted with a fine brain in which I take no pride per se. I find my brain a source for self-deprecation:I am a deviant because most people IQs are within 3 standard deviation of the average. I am a 4.61 deviant. Or, how do you tell really smart people? Most people want to buy a smart pill to be smarter. Really intelligent people price-shop lobotomies.My high school classmates elected me ""most witty"" probably because I was a banner boy . My jokes are pointed and sometimes bad. I told my mother-in-law that I was going to improve my jokes by spending some money at a joke school. She said it would be faster and cheaper to buy duct tape.If I am so intelligent, why did I graduate about 190 out of 400 seniors in high school? Because I was frying hamburgers 40-50 hours a week to survive. I did not have time to do the homework. But I was learning in the classroom, scoring 98% on college boards.My work ethic was acquired early-on. I left home at age 8, self-supporting by shining shoes 40-50 hours a week. A lie? You decide--see ""I did not kill my mother .""At age 25, I realized that I had had five life mentors who helped me escape poverty and depravity. When asked how could I repay them, they all said the same thing: Pass it on. From them I derived that ""Help that does not help the helpless to self-help is, in fact, not help.""I passed it on in my various businesses where I had a youth employment section for high schoolers. Almost all were from lower social economic condition as I was. I told them at the start that they were not hired to be my friend and that they could not get rich working after school. If they did not learn the work ethic--solving problems--then they would be out the door. For several summers I funded a Work Ethic School  with the students formulating 14-point poster .For many years, I would get that call from a former young employee who realize they were doing better in life because of my tutelage. Universally, they said they did not, at the time,  like me because of my tough love. My best thanks came from a chocolate fellow of about 50 years of age. (I like the terms chocolate and vanilla instead of blacks and whites.) In a park, I was approached by Chris who inquired if I was Bob Barnett. When I said yes, he responded that he was in upper-middle management of a large information company. He also said that each time he ponder why he escaped the projects, why he had no drug problems, and why he had not ended up in a jail or down in a grave, he said it all came back to working for me in high school 30 years ago. I would not trade that thanks for all the money in the world.I abdicated from academia in graduate school because of the widespread hypocrisy. My intellectual curiosity did not abate. Consistently with my businesses, besides the youth employment, I had research assistants on the payroll to investigate and answer questions about the nature of time. (This was before Google.) Often 25% of payroll went for the researchers. I had more research time than if I was a professor with duties. A series of books were written in the 1970s and 1980s.When I found that hired computer programmers demanded double pay after six months, I became a programmer to avoid retraining and re-acquainting new graduates. My resume shows, again, some top-shelf computer achievements--see ""Entrepreneur sees solutions from computers .""My greatest intellectual achievement is Timism: The Morality of More Time . Timism has been my intellectual mistress since 1971. There are many definitions of time. However, if one limits time to two variables, one can construct a T.O.E. (theory of everything) from physics to religion. The primary time variable is the measurement of the event (entity) from start to finish. The secondary time variable is the value of that event on other events with which the event interacts. Events are interactively creative or cancerous fostering stability of instability.An event measurement can be a split-second, a lifetime or an eon. An event's time value can be dependent upon the environment of other events. Consider the time value of yelling ""fire"" in crowded venue when there is or isn't a fire. Time gain/loss can be quantified on the continuum from love to hate, that is, from the giving of time to the taking of time. Friends give time while enemies take your time. Politicians waste your time in over-taxation and wasteful spending.Once one focuses on time, as defined above, one sees the stamp of time directly or indirectly in all the schools of thought:Einstein's relativity ... periodic table of elements is a periodic table of periodic times ... mentality--no sense of time, no sense of self ... economics--time is money, money is time ... politics--solving time-wasting problems ... religions--timeless existence.Time is the thread in the fabric of life. One truism is that the spin bars or bares the reaction (1981 reference as D.L. Spinbar: Dibs Lifehourious Spinbar ). Most interestingly, the linear speed of light is an epiphenomenon of the basic particle's rotational speed and precession angle. When time of existence is equated with stability, then gravity is the basic, universal form of time from which all other time and stability derives.Timism is a great heuristic tool, an intellectual Columbus to explore new, undiscovered areas of thought. Along the way in exploring and delineating Timism, some ancillary insights were derived.  For instance, in 1982 I wrote Oil Droughts  which predicted worsening droughts at the mega-sources of CO2 (e.g., California) with downwind deluges and flooding.

The young man was protecting 2 young women in the community, in which one woman has had an active restraining order on the offender. Hit by community violence while protecting local citizens...this young man lost life! his job, his home, and community and is now homeless pending disability benefits..with no shelter opening and the victim is now living in car which is in need of repairs, WE ARE REACHING OUT IN JESUS NAME TO residents of the greater Sacramento Region for any support for a DONATED RV/MOTOR HOME to PROVIDE emergency housings and relocation needs..(as the offender is out of custody in the El Dorado County community pending charges) This article was originally posted in the Mountain Democrat with out FACTS!!

Jeremy Cook was stabbed 9 times on Easter Sunday in Placerville, El Dorado County, California. The young man was protecting two women, one having a criminal protection restraining order and another women who was also being stalked and continuously attacked in the community. There was a brief posting in the Mountain Democrat newspaper which never based any of the real FACTS. Mr. Cook took THREE stab wounds to his chest One to the Heart, ONE to the RIGHT LUNG and ONE the LEFT LUNG, ONE TO HIS FACE, ONE TO LEFT SHOULDER & TWO ON LEFT ARM. He DIED in flight and was REVIVED in flight to surgery. As the offender Jason Lamar was arrested he was also released 3 days after the assault with No Formal Criminal Charges FILED!! Law enforcement also failed to charge the offender with violation of the protective restraining order. While in the hospital fighting for his life the offender was released and ended up assaulting The Other Woman Whom Mr. Cook was trying to protect. The District Attorney's office knowing the offender Jason Lamar has a 20-year history of drug use & violence in the community going in and out of prison, was only sentenced to two months in the county jail for Corporal spousal injury with an enhancement for prison priors. Not only did law enforcement fail to notify the victim's of the offenders release as of September 3, 2019, Mr. Cook has lost his home and his job due to the life disabling attack & is Now fully disabled. HOMELESS HIM SELF NOW! For the victims protection and due to the health of the victim, Mr. Cook was advised to go to a county where there would be services to be housed in a shelter. Yet no shelter is willing to receive him from out of county regardless of his life threatening condition and Doctors medical advise deeming his condition an emergency on his life and this young man is living in his car with this condition along with ADA service dog and myself providing care. There are a lot more facts to this case that the DA has left open. I am providing two links that I would prayerfully ask you to take a look at. Mr Cook and I would like help from the community to bring this offender to justice and help with Mr. Cook's housing and medical needs.

The initiative to complete this wall should not be a political decision. It should be a decision that is based on sound facts as to the implications for the millions of American Citizens and Taxpayers that currently reside in the Contiguous United States.I've worked very hard all my life in an effort to leave the ""American Dream"" a reality for my children and grandchildren and the children and grandchildren of all my fellow Americans. There are a number of things over the years that have threatened this dream, but one of the main ones that we face today is illegal alien immigration.  Estimates for completion of the wall are around $25 Billion Dollars. Annual cost of illegal aliens coming into this country each year are $165 Billion. Therefore, illegal aliens cost American Taxpayers more in three months than the wall will cost to build in its entirety. Illegal aliens cause economic harm to Americans because they consume far more in government services than they contribute in taxes. We make: they take.**ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THREATENS EVERYTHING WE, AS PROUD AMERICANS, HAVE WORKED SO DILIGENTLY FOR ALL OUR LIVES** And when I say we, I mean Native Americans,  English Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Israeli Americans, Irish Americans, Polish Americans, Scottish Americans, Canadian Americans, German Americans, Muslim Americans, Asian Americans, Russian Americans, Indian Americans, Swedish Americans, et al.That's right, I am very fortunate to have good friends of every race, ethnicity, nationality, color and creed. Some of my very best friends and clients are Hispanic Americans. They too want to protect the American Dream they have worked very hard to achieve for their families, as much or more so than any of the rest of us. We are All Proud Americans and we have a right to protect our country from illegal aliens and the threat they pose to the American Dream we work so hard to create and maintain each and every day.   Do Not Misinterpret what I'm saying here folks, I am all for people of every race and color having  the opportunity and ability to immigrate to this country through the legal immigration process. After all, it may have been our forefathers that did it, but that's how the majority of the rest of us got here too. I admire the people from other countries that have that American Dream in their hearts and want to come here to live and become productive members of our great society. Ones that want to contribute to our society and make the American Dream a reality for themselves and their families too. A lot of my friends have done this very thing and some of them have only been here a few years.WHY IS A PERMANENT BORDER BARRIER A GOOD THING AND AN INTEGRAL PART OF A SUCCESSFUL IMMIGRATION PROCESS AND THE KEY TO PROTECTING AND MAINTAINING THE ""AMERICAN DREAM"" ?1) BUILDING A SECURE BOUNDARY WOULD ALLOW THE CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION STAFF TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOBS, WHICH IS TO PROCESS MORE QUICKLY THOSE PEOPLE SEEKING ASYLUM, AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA. 2) HAVING A PERMANENT BARRIER WOULD  ACTUALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER AND LOCATIONS OF DESIGNATED PORTS OF ENTRY, THEREBY ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO BE PROCESSED IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER. 3) HAVING A PERMANENT BARRIER WOULD STIFLE THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL DRUGS AND GUNS COMING ACROSS THE BORDER THAT ARE KILLING SO MANY AMERICANS EACH AND EVERY DAY. 4) A PERMANENT BARRIER WOULD STIFLE THE FLOW OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE VICTIMIZATION OF PEOPLE BEING USED AS SEX SLAVES OR FORCED LABOR SLAVES IN OUR COUNTRY. 5) HAVING A PERMANENT BARRIER WOULD ASSIST IN PROTECTING US FROM THOSE CROSSING THE BORDER THAT HAVE NEFARIOUS INTENTIONS AGAINST OUR SOCIETY. NOT NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE COMING FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, BUT THOSE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD TRYING TO GET ACROSS AND DO AMERICANS HARM.***NOT HAVING A PERMANENT BORDER BARRIER, WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND MEANS TO DO SO, REFLECTS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO ALL THE EVIL THINGS THAT ARE MENTIONED ABOVE***Think about it folks, it's a No Brainer! Take some action right now that will make a difference in your life and the lives of your fellow Americans!KEEP YOUR FAMILY AND ALL YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS SAFE, SECURE, PROSPEROUS, HAPPY AND FREE FOREVER!!That's what it's all about. LET'S MAKE GOD (WHOEVER YOURS MAY BE) AND OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PROUD!!Give as your heart's lead you to give to this Noble and Worthy cause! It's an investment in your future and all the future generations to come!I am a small business owner in North Carolina, with successful team management experience with Major Corporations in several industries over the past 35 years and I'm dedicated to putting a management team together that will accomplish the objectives that are set forth by the ACT NOW community. That management team will represent our group by personally coordinating with private citizens along our Southern border to build segments of Border Wall on their private property at no expense to them. How much better can it get than that?  We will negotiate and coordinate with private contractors to build that border barrier at a fraction of what it cost the government to get it done. Based on private projects that have already taken place by similar organizations, we estimate it will cost around $16 Million per mile of barrier. We will also coordinate with those sister organizations that are working on similar projects to see where the synergies are, so we can get even more bang for the buck for each mile of barrier we erect. The $100 million goal is just a placeholder, as I know that once the Conscientious True Red Blooded American Citizens of All Colors get behind this quest, that's just a drop in the bucket. We would like to see the ACT NOW community contribute at a minimum 100 miles of border barrier to private citizens on the Southern Border, that want it on their property, before the end of the decade.We'd love to have you become an integral part of our great ACT NOW community and show your patriotism by making this dream come true for the 329,103,172  Million American Brothers and Sisters of All Colors that we currently have in our homeland!**DO NOT LET PARTISAN POLITICS INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION HERE!

I am an 18 year employee of the United States Federal Government. I have been furloughed due to the current Government shut-down, and will not receive a paycheck until my employing agency is funded by Congress. I will likely receive back pay, if Congress passes legislation to retroactively pay those of us who have been furloughed. My husband is a recent legal immigrant, and I have a 13 year-old son who is a straight A student, and active in our parish, marching band, and jazz band.

I believe that members of Congress must reach an agreement with our President to ensure  protection is afforded to Citizens and legal residents by securing our southern border, passing meaningful immigration reform, and stopping the flow of illegal drugs and human trafficking across our unsecured border. The new Democratic led House of Representatives has already shown how deceptive and hypocritical they are, by pretending to espouse humanitarian principals - all while passing legislation to fund the government that is tied to rescinding the Mexico City Agreement - in order to allow for the use of Federal funds to finance NGOs that end the lives of innocent unborn babies, through the heinous act of abortion. I pray that our President holds firm to his promise to secure our nation, protect us and our children from migrant gang members, illegal drugs, and economic hardship caused by allowing unchecked and illegal migration into the United States. I also hope he holds firm and does not allow the pro-abortion politicians, like Speaker Pelosi to overturn the good work he did in putting an end to using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions inforeign countries. My family and I are willing to tighten our belts, and hunker down for however long it takes, for the President to do what he needs to do in order to secure sincere compromise from the Democrats in Congress. I simply refuse to have my family's livelihood used as a bargaining chip for those who are disingenuous in their efforts to work with our President. Unfortunately, during this time of dysfunction in Washington, we lost my mother-in-law on January 2, 2019. Mummy passed away from heart failure in West Africa. She was a beautiful soul, who treated me as her very own daughter. As we mourn her passing, my husband and I must also help to pay for her burial. Along with that, my son was blessed to receive help from our parish, in order that he may attend this year's March for Life in Washington, D.C.  This will be my son's first time at the March for Life, and it is very important to him - as he was born to me, while I was a single mother, and his own life is a testimony to the fact that no child need become a victim to the horror of abortion. While we are grateful for the help of our parish, to make my son's trip to Washington possible,I do need to ensure that he has warm clothes to wear during the March for Life - help with that added expense, during this shutdown, would be appreciated. 

As I mentioned above - I fully expect to receive retroactive pay, once Congress finally chooses to end this shutdown. Apart from my federal employment, I have long volunteered my time and money to photograph newborn babies of men and women who have chosen life over abortion, at our local Women's Care Clinic. It is my promise to anyone willing to assist us through this Gofundme campaign, that I will use these funds to continue that ministry, once I am returned to pay status. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and know that I am grateful for your consideration in assisting my family during this time of dysfunction in Washington. 

May God bless you, and your loved ones.

$100 raised of $20,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/a-book-to-raise-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-awareness,"Salem, MA",The HHV-6 & Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Campaign,"Created December 18, 2018","Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a neglected international public health emergency. The history of the emerging Chronic Fatigue Syndrome epidemic can be found in The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic Cover-up , a book that pioneering CFS journalist Hillary Johnson called ""important."" We want to send a thousand copies of this history of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome epidemic to members of Congress, government scientists, and opinion leaders in the media.Imagine if every member of Congress and every journalist at every major media outlet knew the seriousness of an epidemic which is contagious, has already affected millions,  and has been called ""Non-HIV AIDS."" We think that our project of getting The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic Cover-up  into as many of their hands as possible will be a major step toward that goal. You can be part of this effort.More information about this book which is available on Amazon can be found here . It will cost the publisher, Rubicon Media,  about $20 to send each print copy of The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic Cover-up   to a thousand opinion leaders who can help make research into Chronic Fatigue Syndrome a public health priority. Even if your donation just allows us to send one book to a politician or journalist who could make a difference, that donation could change the course of this terrifying epidemic.Interest in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is increasing slightly, but many people are not aware of the history of the struggle to get the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to tell the truth about the serious nature of the epidemic and to devote appropriate resources to it. Anyone getting involved in the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome crisis must learn about the issues that have been ignored or covered up in the past.By donating you will be helping us to make this a priority in Congress and a frontpage story all over the world.Here is the Amazon description of The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic Cover-up :Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a serious immunological illness that seems to be caused by a very destructive virus. To fully understand the seriousness of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome epidemic, you need to go back in time. On April 16, 1996, Congressman Jerrold Nadler spoke on the floor of Congress about his request for a General Accounting investigation into how the CDC had handled the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome epidemic. Nadler did that at the urging of Charles Ortleb, the publisher of New York Native and his reporter Neenyah Ostrom. Ortleb and Ostrom had made the case to Nadler that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and the virus it had been linked to, HHV-6, were serious public health issues. In an interview in New York Native with Neenyah Ostrom, Congressman Nadler said, ""Congress can mandate research into CFS as a viral disease. Maybe it will turn out that HHV-6A is the cause of CFS; maybe it will turn out that other viruses are involved. But Congress can mandate research into CFS as a contagious, viral disease. I will certainly try to get Congress to do that as soon as possible.""Unfortunately, back in 1996, Nadler's warning to Congress and the medical establishment fell on deaf ears. But now that the Democrats have regained power in the House of Representatives, the newly prominent Congressman Nadler may finally be able to bring the CFS epidemic and HHV-6 to the public's attention.This book by Charles Ortleb, which details Neenyah Ostrom's diligent reporting on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, is necessary reading for anyone who wants to know the whole history of an epidemic which has been hidden in plain sight. For a decade, starting in 1988, Ostrom reported on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and the damage that the virus HHV-6 does to patients. What her reporting uncovered about the nature of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome epidemic will shock you. In The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic Cover-up , Charles Ortleb recounts his newspaper's fascinating struggle to get the medical and political establishment to pay attention to Ostrom's pioneering investigative reporting on CFS. By the time you finish Ortleb's stunning memoir, you will understand why the CDC has been unwilling to tell the truth about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The CDC does not want the public to know that CFS is a transmissible illness linked to a virus that affects every system in the body. They have covered up CFS for so many decades that the neglected virus is totally out of control. Now it is causing a long list of other illnesses and many cancers. The CDC has put us all in danger.Ostrom's decade of reporting on HHV-6 was recently vindicated by this statement from scientists at the University of Wurzburg:""While HHV-6 was long believed to have no negative impact on human health, scientists today increasingly suspect the virus of causing various diseases such as multiple sclerosis or chronic fatigue syndrome. Recent studies even suggest that HHV-6 might play a role in the pathogenesis of several diseases of the central nervous system such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression or Alzheimer's."" The big question about Neenyah Ostrom and New York Native is this: How many lives would have been saved if the scientific establishment and the mainstream media had paid more attention to Neenyah Ostrom's reporting on HHV-6 and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in New York Native? Anyone who wants to help Congressman Nadler and the other members of Congress who are trying to end the suffering of millions of people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, needs to read The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic Cover-up .One of the most important issues The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic Cover-up  raises, is the role of Kaposi's Sarcoma in the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome epidemic.Important information about the Kaposi’s Sarcoma problem in Chronic Fatigue SyndromeWhatever happened to the concern about controlling the Kaposi's Sarcoma Virus?

Charles Ortleb's compelling history of his newspaper and the work of his pioneering CFS reporter, Neenyah Ostrom, is a must-read for anyone who wants to know the whole disturbing story of an epidemic hidden in plain sight.""We want to thank everyone who helps us get this book into the hands of people who can make a change.

In a book and an adapted, eight-episode, limited television series, we are presenting a plan for national unity and prosperity written in consultation with a ""congress"" of 40 Americans.This ""congress"" included Americans representing all ages, races, occupations and regions and parties, and including a refugee, an anti-immegration advocate, men and women's rights advocates, gay and trans Americans, religious fundamentalists, veterans, ex-convicts,  policy experts, disabled Americans, and homeless Americans.We are happy to report that, to-date, our plan for national reconciliation and equitable prosperity has been edited by a group of ten Americans and published as an ebook (amazon link below). Andand the television series has been filmed. The first of the eight episodes has been edited and released, but but additional funding needs to be raised to finish the series and distribute it nationally. Here is the link to the first episode, which adapts the first chapter of the ebook :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZENSMfuYH6gWe strongly recommend watching this first episode. It has our faces, our unity message, and our passion, as well as an impression of what the subsequent episodes will be like in tone and production value. The 5,000 dollars we hope to raise will fund the editing and the distribution of the third and the fourth episodes. Funds raised in excess will fund the editing and the distribution of fifth, sixth, seventh, and final episodes (at a flat cost of 2500 per episode ).OUR STORYThis project began with one American taking a stand for political moderation and national unity.This American had been reluctant to become involved in politics. He just wanted to work his job, care for his family and live out a quiet life. He tried to ignore the national political debate even as it grew louder and more and more threatening. National politics had disgusted him. Politicians and leaders didn't represent the America he knew - the America he loved - a mild, modest, fair, tolerant, and respectful people.But a concern grew in him. A growing concern these Americans and these values that he loved were threatened by our leadership. As well as a growing awareness of the responsibility of the average citizen to act.Our constitutional tradition suggested a plan of action, to seek out the will of the people. So he conducted a series of interviews with forty Americans. Forty Americans selected as representatives of forty Americas. Forty political parties, sects, factions, industries and demographics variously mis-represented and mis-lead by our national politics. He sat down with republicans and democrats, men’s and women’s right activists, LGBT Americans, national minorities, immigrants, and refugees, anti-immigration activists, religious conservatives, boomers, gen X’ers, and millennials to ask them four questions. 1. How are you feeling?  2. What’s wrong with this country? 3. Who is to blame? 4. What is to be done? What he didn’t realize is that he was assembling a congress, a congress truly representative of the people for a vote on a national plan. What he couldn’t anticipate is that this vote would be unanimous. We have a plan. A plan for addressing the nation’s inequality and injustice that will bring us all together. That plan, titled, “The American Way,” can be found in this short ebook of the same title : https://www.amazon.com/American-Way-Cincinnatus-Hibbard-ebook/dp/B07PFQ9237/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_2crid=1KOPZ9IQG2K9&keywords=cincinnatus+hibbard&qid=1556586893&s=gateway&sprefi=cincinnatus%2Caps%2C290&sr=8-2-fkmrnull But to make put affirmation of real American values in a plan for national unity in front of the nation we have undertaken its adaptation to a series of eight television episodes. While 41 American volunteers were involved in the writing of the plan, and a second 59 American professionals involved in the filming of the plan, so far the one man that started has had to edit and distribute the film himself. The reason is money. Professional film editing takes the editor 5 hours to edit each minute of film and the collaboration of a team of other film professionals – musicians, sound designers, graphic designers, color graders and vFx. By taking time off work and taking out a loan he was able to complete the first episode introducing the project and themes ( see first link at the top of the page ). To complete the project in time to bring a strong voice of unity and moderation into the next presidential election cycle he needs your help. This fundraising initiative  is an opportunity to bring together an even larger and more diverse group of Americans to finish this series and distribute it to America. In many respects the success of this fundraiser is a second, larger vote on the plan.YOUR DONATION  We are asking for a donation of 10 dollars from each subscriber. Please no more than 10 dollars unless the donation represents a group or household. 10 dollars represents about one minimum wage hour. We would invite you to think of the donation in terms of their time and their labor, in as much as your money. With this donation you are giving one hour committed labor working for the cause of national unity, equity, and prosperity.Think of it as your stand.Think of it as your vote. Your money and labor are essential to the completion of this project. But equally important is the endorsement that that money and labor represent – it is a vote for moderation and unity. And for this project to go forward it needs the mandate of a popular vote. Let’s vote in favor of ""The American Way."" OUR THANKS In addition to the gratification of having our message of moderation and unity represented in the national debate, you would have our thanks and appreciation – all 100 of us that were involved in the writing and the filming of our plan. Your name will be added to the episode of the series that you helped to fund. As it takes approximately 5 hours to edit one minute of film, you will have personally financed about twenty seconds of film. Along with your message, your name will be taken to tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of Americans. You will also have an opportunity to screen the episodes in advance of the general public and give feedback to shape and improve the episode. And lastly, you will in time have the thanks of a grateful nation. Now is the time."

The ""White Hat Revolutionary"" is the handle I will use on Twitter and Facebook.THE WHITE HAT REVOLUTIONARYPrefaceI blamed it on Obama's disappointing presidency that worked against America. I became a Libertarian Anti-Democrat. Evidence coming forward for SpyGate confirms my position against the Democratic Deep State that is so pervasive. I see people like George Soros, the Clintons, the Podesta brothers, the Obamas, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, James Comey, Jesse Jackson, Rahm Emmanuel and Maxine Waters as profiteering puppets for the same Deep State. If you want to learn more about the Deep State, and its players and its methods, as well as all about Jussie Smollett, then this is the book for you. In fact, you cannot really know all about Smollett's scandal without understanding the Deep State that tried to rescue him and cover everything Jussie My next book will tell how we might ""purify"" our government so that the Deep State can't control our destiny so easily. For me, it's the Deep States of the world that limit our individual and collective potential, and are the root cause of our most pressing problems.I will present all of the known facts about Jussie's scandal and I will present my opinions and those of others, and it will be clear which is which. This should be of great value to all. I will also rebut people who lie about Jussie and who lie to us about what really happened, and who continue to spread disinformation. Jussie should be criticized, not because of the color of his skin or his sexual orientation, but because of his character. His case teemed with menacing, selfish intent, and lies. There is good evidence to show that he lied to the police and the media to create a hoax and he lied again and again to cover it up. If true, he represents a form of hoaxing threat to our society that we don't want to see spread. He could have incited riots, even a race war. We must discourage this type of behavior, and especially because Chicago's courts did not. Jussie apparently leveraged his race and sexual orientation, and his fame, in an attempt to gain even more fame and money and political clout for the new LGBTQ movement gaining power and that just put Lisa Lightfoot into office as mayor of Chicago. He had little regard for those who might get hurt in the process. In fact, he intentionally tried to put at risk white male Trump supporters.If you think Jussie is unselfish and honest, and a victim, you will learn differently. Republicans will love this book because it not only pokes fun at the Democratic elites, including those who made fools of themselves in social media because of Jussie's hoax, but because it shows what form of race war Republicans will face in 2020.Rather than just catching a bad actor acting badly for personal gain, the most value with Jussie lies in what happened in the Chicago justice system. The injustice in Chicago became an obvious and well-documented case of political and judicial corruption, and cover up, key vertebrae of the backbone of the Deep State. Many blacks and other minorities are telling us that the white Democratic leaders and their institutions really don't care about them, it's just a show. Democrats have acted more to use them and keep them oppressed rather than advance them. It is for those people that I also write in hope of making a better world for them and hence for all. I think we will see some brave Democrats act on this, and shift their votes accordingly, even if they choose to do it secretly to avoid persecution. We have a tremendous opportunity to turn Jussie’s scandal around by doing the right thing and expose and expunge those who helped him cheat the justice system. If we play Jussie's case properly against them, we can take down some of the Democratic leadership that constantly works to divide us for political gain."

Why does the national bird of the US, the eagle, coincidentally have the best eyesight? Here ladies and gentlemen, is why:

In the early 1960s when JFK had become president, new drone technology was developing in United States. The FBI at this time proposed to Kennedy that a mass genocide of birds should take place and have them replaced by mechanical drones disguised as birds to roam the skies for surveillance purposes. Kennedy thought this idea was outrageous, and planed to expose the corruption within his government to the general public. Before he was able to do so, he was shot and killed so he would remain silent. FBI officials then learned that a Democratic president wouldn’t be suitable to follow through with such a task, so they waited for the next republican president to be elected. This happened to be Richard Nixon, and he full heartedly accepted this proposal to have drones that spy on the American people. Right before his reelection, and right after he committed mass genocide on the birds to replace with drones, he grew paranoid that the Democratic Party knew his secret. This lead to what we all know as the Watergate scandal so that he could prove whether or not the Democrats really knew what his intentions were. The Democrats were suspicious and quickly knew he was hiding something once they busted him for what happened at Watergate. Nixon, to stay out of trouble and take the attention off of this potential issue, resigned as president. Ever since, the FBI and the United States government have been using surveillance drones disguised as birds to peek in on our every day lives. I plan on raising awareness on this frightening issue by purchasing an ad for the yearbook that will help expose the governments wrongdoings. Thank you, and #WakeUpAmerica.

Empowering all to embrace their God given potential and take personal responsivity for their lives and their desired pursuit of happiness. Originally the Black Republican Caucus of Palm Beach County (BRCPBC) in 2012; Soon after the election of Sean P. Jackson as Chairman of the Board in 2013, what was then known as BRCPBC became the Black Republican Caucus of South Florida (BRCSF). During its success of increasing black voter turnout, at the direction of Chairman Jackson, BRCSF again grew to, increase its footprint to cover the entire state of Florida, becoming the Black Republican Caucus of Florida (BRCF) in 2015. Chairman Jackson has intentionally committed to growing this reputable organization organically, allowing for true and sustainable influence to pierce the hearts and minds of voters statewide. After the success of doubling the black vote in the 2016 Presidential Election and again in 2018, delivering an unprecedented 26% of the black vote to Governor Ron DeSantis, BRCF is preparing to announce the launch of its bi-annual Black Voter Summit where black republicans from across the united States will descend upon Miami Beach to discuss policy, candidates, candidate training and influence in government that’ll assist with the passing of legislation to help enhance urban communities. BRCF continues to grow leaps and bounds, now recognized as the largest black republican organization in the United States, however, receives ZERO assistance from the Republican National Committee nor the Republican Party of Florida. Just as the RNC and RPOF must raise money in order to get out the vote, so does the Black Republican Caucus of Florida. With no resources, there no ability to reach the voters!A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN:Since becoming Chairman of the Board in 2013, the Black Republican Caucus of Florida has - Increased black republican voter registration in FL from 41k to 57k- Doubled the black vote in Florida during the 2016 Presidential election from 4% to 8%- Delivered 26% of the black vote to Governor Ron DeSantis 2018 Gubernatorial election - Commenced its bi-annual Evening of Diamonds & Ice Scholarship Gala- Planned and organized its Inaugural Black Voter Summit- Planned expansion to become the National Black Republican Caucus - Drafted 5 – year plan to increase black republican registration / turnout nationwide As I travel the Great State of Florida and our Nation, I meet thousands of wonderful people who all tell me the same thing “we’re tired of juts giving our vote to the Democrats, they’ve done nothing for our community”. What this tells me is that black America is yearning for change, they’re yearning for something new. However, the Republican Party hasn’t done much either to show our eagerness to embrace black America, until now! BRCF can offer a hand UP and not a hand OUT. From our community outreach events that offer the tools and resources necessary to be a sustainable, thriving and productive citizens; to our grassroots efforts to elect conservatives, BRCF is making it clear to both black Floridians and black Americans nationwide, that the Republican Party is the ONLY party who’s consistently fighting on behalf of people of color. From the freeing of slaves, to supporting passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to present day the passage of the First Step Act and job creation that’s brought black unemployment to its lowest levels in our Nations HISTORY! The Republican Party continues to prove that our policies are what’s best for people of color. Make no mistake there is a lot of work ahead of us, but that’s what excites me most, is we have the opportunity of a lifetime to bring about a “Culture Changing Movement” that with the continued help of our highly dedicated volunteers, your support, and God’s grace, we will prevail. Don’t ever forget that we the American people are the light of the world. It is that light that rests within the city set on a hill. Such a city cannot be hidden. It is Gods will that we remain the light of the world. Steadfast & LoyalSean P.

Over the last 100 years, since the end of World War I, the Statue of Liberty's torch has been the shining beacon of freedom for the rest of the world.  We defeated Nazism in World War II because Americans were willing to die for our ideas. We won the Cold War, not with our nuclear arsenal, but rather with our ideas, because enslaved nations wanted to also own our ideas. Today, this administration is repudiating the very American ideas that have made us who we are as Americans, as well as what we represent to the rest of the world.WHO The idea of the  ""Trump Wall"" is un-American. It matters not if you are a Democrat, Independent, or Republican because you are first an American. We are all first Americans, before defining ourselves as New Yorkers, Republicans, Christians, Liberals, or Generation X. Therefore, a barrier that divides people cannot be supported by Americans.

For our October 24th action, we developed a coalition of dozens of NYC groups, organizers, and immigration justice advocates. Our underlying ideology and strategic vision comes from Cosecha, and we are following their lead as we work to build a world with the free movement of people, where no one faces the risk of detention and deportation. Join us in a march and direct action to DEMAND drivers licenses for all of New Jersey's residents! For too long, the undocumented community has been fighting for the right to drive without fear. Politicians have broken their promises over and over again while continuing to profit from tearing immigrant families apart. We cannot rest until every member of our community can get behind the wheel without fear of detention, deportation, and family separation.We DEMAND that Democrats pass legislation to guarantee #LicensesForAll.We DEMAND that Democrats stop breaking their promises to the immigrant community and stop being complicit in Trump's deportation machine.We DEMAND the closure of the Camps and end of the ICE contracts now. Especially in NJ Essex, Bergen, and Hudson counties, where the Democrats are profiting collaborating with ICE and balancing county budgets with blood money on the backs of immigrant families. Join us if you believe that everyone deserves to live with dignity, respect, and permanent protectionBy allowing individuals to risk arrest as part of our direct action team, we showed that there will be no more business as usual in NYC, and we demonstrated to the Starrett Lehigh building and the public how serious we take this campaign. We are currently fundraising $2,400 to cover the remaining legal expenses from this action. While many arrestees in our NYC actions were given Adjournments Contemplating Dismissal (ACD), New Jersey does not grant them. Rather than attempting to wage a costly and time-consuming legal battle, these participants will each be paying a $120 court fine. While we believe in the righteousness of our cause, taking these charges to trial could involve multiple court appearances from each arrestee, and also a burden our lawyer who has offered free representation to Close the Camps for thisWe recognize that the money that we need to raise to cover these expenses could be spent in other ways, in the quest for immigration justice. In consultation with members of our coalition, we have determined the importance of using non-violent direct action as one critical tactic, and unfortunately there are expenses that come along with this approach. We are committed to an open and accessible form of organizing that welcome all to join us in our struggle for immigration justice. Anyone can join our direct action teams, and ability to cover any costs related to our protests will never be a barrier to participation. We appreciate everyone who is able to donate to our fundraiser, or who can help our efforts by sharing this gofundme page to any allies, via email or social media. Moving forward, we will do what we can to limit any legal costs associated with our actions. Any money raised above our $2,400 goal will be used to cover costs of our other actions. If you would like to donate without using gofundme, you can reach us at info@closethecampsnyc.com. You can find out more information about our Evict ICE campaign at www.EvictICENYC.com. Close the Camps NYC is open to support from any New Yorkers who share our goals and strategies.

I don't have a verified blue check facebook page as a public figure and I’m a person who doesn't like walls.•  AFTER DONATING VISIT www.WeWontFundTheWall.com (if I've bought it by then) to join our groups on social media• Please read entire statement before emailing questions• DO NOT MAKE DONATIONS IN CELEB/POLITICIAN NAMES - They will be refunded according to GFM rules.• Any questions about this, don't contact me. It's real simple. Donate to Amnesty International instead of building a stupid wall.•  AFTER DONATING VISIT www.WeWontFundTheWall.com  to join our groups on social media CHECK DONATIONS:We don't accept them. Checks are almost as bad as walls.---------------------------------------------------------------The government has accepted large private donations before, most recently a billionaire donated $7.5 Million  to fund half of the Washington Monument repairs in 2012; this is much different. That was a gift to a non-profit called Trust for the National Mall which was arranged through congress to provide matching funds. That's also 7.5 million - not 5 billion, and not building a wall between two neighbor countries with the DHS.Like a majority of those American citizens who didn't vote to elect President Donald J Trump, we didn't vote for him because he will divide us from our neighbors and do stupid things. President Trump’s main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he hasn't followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still - and a bunch of people who are probably misguided are doing something on gofundme where who knows where the money will end up since it's ambiguous how this could be accepted and if they'll even make it up to a noticeable sum of money.As a guy who lives here and spends most of my time here, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today and are treated as human beings. I don't really understand how people have such grand misconceptions about illegal immigration and its effects on the economy and culture, especially when they're doing substantial research into the bureaucratic process of financial gifts to the US government and could be spending that time learning that people are people no matter where they're born.I have great, great grandparents who immigrated to America, and I don't know if they did so legally and I don't care. They did it because they were being murdered in the Ukraine and had to get the hell out of there! It’s up to Americans to help out and pitch in to create a world in which refugees are not denied asylum and nationalism doesn't prevent us from doing the right thing and helping people of other flags, even if that means accepting them into our country and supporting them.If the 71,791,044 people who voted against Trump each pledge $1, we can probably fund Al for a while. That equates to roughly $71,791,044, even if we get half, that's half of that amount. We can do this. Democrats are going to stall this project by every means possible and play political games to ensure President Trump doesn’t get his victory, if we're lucky. They'd rather see President Trump fail, then see America become a gated community.  However, if we can fund a large amount of money for this project, it will do a lot of good and make a lot of people angry.This won’t be easy, but it’s our duty as citizens. This needs to be shared every single day by each of you on social media. We can do it, and we can help President Trump lose his *$@#% mind.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------• How do you know this is not a scam? It's gofundme. It's registered with them for a charity, and that's how it works. People who try to scam you will probably not be on gofundme, though apparently there are a lot of idiots on it. Again, I don't have a public figure Facebook page with a blue check mark issued by facebook that verifies my identity. I'm not a veteran, and I while I respect and admire the accomplishments of Brian Kolfage and his sacrifices and service, I do not agree with his position about the wall or his attitude towards immigration. This fundraiser is not meant in any way to demean or insult Mr. Kolfage or his family, and I would love to talk to him about why I believe his opinions and goals are a little lost, even when held by an inspirational triple amputee who has amazing strength and courage. I have don't have a website yet where you can verify more about me.  I won't respond to Direct Messages. I've never been on Fox News, so you can see I'm credible and a real person. Do your research before donating about Amnesty International and all the good work they do around the world.• How will we get the funds to the right place? It's part of how this platform works. Because we're not raising money for a pipe dream rooted in fear and ignorance.• Republican Representative Steven Palazzo of Mississippi is introducing legislation to direct the Treasury Department to issue government savings bonds which would allow them to fund the wall with this method. Seems crazy. Let's see what happens there, I guess.• 100% of your donations (I assume, I haven't checked gofundme's rules) will go to Amnesty International and not to the Trump Wall.• There's no need to work with a law firm because it's a real charity, again, not some strange idea of a citizen-government-wall project.• The funds go to charity. Again. No worries here.• If we don’t reach our goal or come significantly close we will just donate it anyways because hey, money is money.LET'S NOT HELP GET THIS WALL BUILT!

$9 raised of $20.0M                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/nonamericans-can-help-stop-trump039s-agenda,"Saltillo, MS",Non-Americans Can Help Stop Trump's Agenda,"Created August 23, 2019","Everyone on Earth will suffer if Donald Trump is re-elected in 2020. It is also true that, whether Trump is re-elected or not, if Republicans continue to control the United States Senate, then Trump can never be removed from office using the impeachment process. Controlling the House was a good start, but it was not enough to get rid us of this insane threat to international peace and security. Most people may think that they can do NOTHING if they are not Americans and, therefore, cannot vote. Nothing could be further from the truth.While restrictions certainly exist for contributions from non-US citizens, NOTHING in the law prohibits someone handing money, as a gift, to a US citizen, and then relying on that person's good judgement about who to make a political donation to.The legal limit, per US citizen, for contributions is $2,000.00 per citizen, per candidate, per election. That means, if someone hands me $1,070,000.00, then I could contribute $2,000.00 to every Democrat in both the House and the Senate, running in the General election scheduled for November 2020. The law, similarly authorizes a like amount (another $2,000.00 per citizen, per candidate, per election) for any primary contests.This does not even begin to address the same limits for US citizens in the Presidential primaries and the general election.There is no legal limit for contributions by Americans (as opposed to non-Americans) to Political Action Committees which are pledged to support particular candidates.EVERY CONTRIBUTION TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS IS A PUBLIC RECORD SO EVERYTHING I PLAN TO CONTRIBUTE WILL BE VISIBLE ON THE INTERNET.What I am asking is that you Non-Americans out there, who otherwise may feel that you can do little or nothing about Trump and his Agenda to consider donating whatever you can to this cause and entrusting me to make the MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS, LEGALLY PERMITTED, IN EACH ELECTION IN THE NEXT 18 MONTHS SO THAT DONALD J. TRUMP IS EITHER DEFEATED, OUTRIGHT, IN HIS ATTEMPT TO REMAIN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, OR THAT HE AT LEAST HAS NO MAJORITY IN EITHER THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE TO SUPPORT HIS AGENDA.All 435 House Seats are up for re-election in 2020 as well as over 33 Senate Seats. The outcome of these elections will control what happens with Trump as much as the election for President, itself. Many governor races are also up for re-election in 2020 and these also impact Trumps ability to carry out his agenda because these Governors have a lot to say about voting districts and, indirectly, on how votes for President are counted.It is my intention to give $2,000.00 to every candidate, in every election who goes on the record as opposing Trumps agenda.If and/or when I have given money to every Democrat, in every election, I plan to donate whatever remains from donated funds to various Political Action Committees which have pledged to support opponants of Trump and his agenda.Ideally, this money will come in swiftly and, just as swiftly, leave my checking account, and give the vital support to those Democrats and others who have the will and the the spine to oppose this man. I do not suggest that I am the only one who can do this. If you have a friend or a relative who is an American citizen, then they can be just as helpful in this cause as I hope to be. I only offer myself and my services to the concerned citizens of this planet to stop this man who has big trouble with the truth and seems to completely disbelieve in science.  We are burning too much coal, have too many guns and are separating too many families. Donald J. Trump does not represent the best of America and he certainly has no regard for most of the rest of the world.  Imagine being denied a visa just because Trump decides you are not white enough, or that you come from a ""shit hole country"".I am ashamed on this man and would respectfully ask you to help me get rid of him and help my country to find it's sanity and humanity, once more.Thank you for your attention and for whatever help you can provide.Please tell your friends and do whatever you can, whether you send anything to me or not.The People of Earth need to help correct this situation that has overtaken the United States of America but seems to have such a bad effect on THE WHOLE WORLD.Now is your chance to take action. Please do something.   "

$7 raised of $250                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/tellNC09voters,"Newton Center, MA",Let NC09 voters know they have more options!,"Created August 27, 2019","
Early voting for North Carolina's 9th Congressional District is already underway, yet there has been a media blackout of two third party candidates.At a time when voters are increasingly interested in alternative voices, and ballot access rules have finally been eased in North Carolina, 9th District voters have a chance to consider Libertarian Party candidate Jeff Scott and Green Party candidate Allen Smith. In order to have a fair election, it's essential that 9th District voters learn about all of their options on the ballot.Unfortunately, local media is muddying the waters by focusing on the two major party candidates, ignoring the third party contenders, and flooding the airwaves with negative attack ads from outside spending groups. This turns people off and manipulates them into voting against the candidate they are most afraid of, instead of arming them with the information they need to make an informed decision.The only televised debate, hosted by The Charlotte Observer and WBTV on August 28th, is limited to the Democrat and Republican candidate.We at the Open the Debates fight hard to raise awareness about all ballot options. We've never tried this before, but we're launching a GoFundMe to counter some of the misinformation flying around the 9th District, and to let voters know they have four choices in this September 10 special election.While millions of dollars of outside money has been pouring in, we have a modest goal of $250 to buy social media ads spreading the word. We don't support either the Libertarian Party or Green Party candidates, because we don't support candidates, period. But we sure as heck think voters have a right to know about ALL of their ballot choices BEFORE they show up to vote. Of course $250 won't make a big dent, but with your help we can reach thoughtful citizens in the district who can help spread the word for fair elections.

Open the Debates is a 501c3 project of the Mediators Foundation. Working to build bridges across the divides of our time, Mediators Foundation has led the way in creating a transpartisan movement to make government work for We, the People, once and for all.

I am working toward an America where politics don’t get in the way of real values. We all deserve an America where the “American Dream”  can be a reality, not for a few lucky people, but for every American. This country boasts noble ideals. I see a very near future where we actually embody those ideals. If you want to see the same for this nation take the brave step in supporting me with a donation to campaign for the Presidential election of 2020. We don’t have to keep settling for more of the same. We can have the America we deserve. A great America for all of us.  Humans are better off when we are united. Division is becoming a huge problem in our world and I want to end it. All people essentially want the same things. These are life, liberty, and our own pursuit of happiness. The document that founded this nation highlighted those things and gave us the impression that the preservation of our right to theses things is exactly what this nation stands for. My aim is to end unnecessary division and bring us to a united front in which we seek the preservation of these rights for EVERY American. I am not a conventional candidate and most will wonder what the hell I think I’m doing trying to run for the office of president. I know I’m different and my approach will be as well. I also know that I have a passion for creating a world worthy of leaving to our children, grandchildren and beyond. Current politicians are failing us.Our two party system is failing us. Separation and division are failing us. I want to bring us together and fix the things that matter to all of us. I will address our economy and it’s continued growth. I will research and implement changes that make wealth building realistically accessible for every American. I value education and will work with real frontline educators to improve and advance our education system so that all Americans have access to the type of education that will position them individually, as well as us as a nation, for success in this ever evolving world. I will work with economists and lawmakers to simultaneously reduce the national debt and the tax burden of middle class and working class Americans. I want to individual Americans pay less in taxes and our tax dollars used more efficiently. I will work to reform the prison system in America saving taxpayer dollars and creating real justice for all. I will work to improve our Department of Veterans Affairs so that the brave men and women that defend our nation can experience the freedom and opportunity they fought to preserve. I am not a republican or a democrat. I am a free American and I will work with both parties to facilitate freedom, justice, and prosperity for every American. Partisan politics gets us nowhere. I won’t play that game. I stand for the people. As I’ve already mentioned, I know I’m not the most likely candidate. I’m not a politician. I don’t fit the traditional role of what looks presidential. I’m younger than any previous President we’ve had before. What makes me qualified for the job? I love the people of this nation. I love the ideals of this nation. My only agenda is to see true peace, freedom, justice, progress, and quality of life for everyone and to leave the world better than it was when I got here. I may be unlike any candidate ever before, but I’m also going to do this differently than any other candidate or president.  I’m going to this for the people and with the people. So I’m asking you to join me today in building the America we all dream of. The threshold for registering a campaign with the Federal Election Commission  is raising or spending $5000. That is why this first fundraiser is for only $5000 dollars. Once we reach our initial goal I will register with the FEC and make my official announcement. I invite you be on the frontlines of change by donating today."

$0 raised of $50,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/keep-america-great-always,"Los Angeles, CA",Keep America Great Always!,"Created September 10, 2019","Mission statement:For almost a decade Americans had to suffer under the weak and aimless leadership of a left-leaning Democrat administration. Thankfully the people of this great nation powerfully rebuked them last election, and brought in a government that was ready to cut waste and truly focus on the working class. From the moment President Donald J. Trump entered the oval office he has been tirelessly pursuing a real America first agenda with amazing results. Now we must work hard to cement the momentum this conservative movement has generated across the country, straight into the November 2020 federal election. The Obama administration had time and again implemented globalist policies that stymied the economic growth of our great nation. From allowing over regulated industry watchmen to shutting down vital industrial projects, and using gutless negotiation tactics that led to the USA being pushed around on the world stage for far too long. While the average American faced wage stagnation and areas of high unemployment, the left's globalist elites profited off the backs of working class folks. But thankfully the 2016 election ushered in an era of change, beginning when President Trump drained the swamp that was Washington. Next the President assembled a cabinet of exemplary individuals, successful leaders from across many business sectors. Despite being hampered at every step by opposition fanatics the President still managed to confirm an incredible amount of appointments and passed through legislation aimed at stimulating economic development at home, not abroad. Now with unemployment at it's lowest levels across the country, and an unprecedented economic growth period, President Trump is engaging in his most vital task yet. China has been extending their reach to all corners of the world, an expansion built on stolen intellectual property and manufacturing jobs (mostly from America). While decades of experts and past administrations have wrung their hands uselessly, President Trump has taken the Chinese to task. Having the upper hand in this trade war is causing the Chinese economy to stumble for the first time since the 1970's and we need to strike while the iron is hot. The Chinese are planning to wait out the negotiations, hoping that a Democratic candidate will be elected. They would of course immediately cave in, capitulating to Chinese demands to ensure their special interest groups stay wealthy. We must stay the course, highlighting the factual accomplishments of this current administration while pin-pointing the falsehoods spread by his opponents in and out of government. Keep America Great Always! is led by ordinary people who truly care about their communities, many becoming politically active for the first time in our lives. For too long liberals have claimed to have the support of common people while stigmatizing any conservative organization as being controlled by large corporations with general lobbyists. This is consistent with two years of falsehoods being circulated on-line and in the media, attacks on our President designed to halt any an all progress he tries to engage in. We will show them that there are still many patriots from sea to shining sea supporting our amazing President at a local level.President Trump has been hampered by partisan rhetoric throughout every single day of his presidency. Even now, as an immigration crisis unfolds on the border with Mexico, democratic lawmakers stall any legislation that could lead to a solution. Immigration judges remain unconfirmed, ICE remains underfunded, and construction on the border wall is constantly delayed. As the President tries his best to stop the influx of illegal immigrants bringing drugs into the country, left-wing socialists and their media allies will stop at nothing to keep that from happening. They prefer to focus on the ""controversial"" tweet of the day rather than fix the actual problems facing our nation.And while the left are content to let military expenditure dry up, working class jobs leave the country, and keep an undefended border that greatly weakens our southern states; we will push back. We've fought too hard to get where we are, and we have to much too lose. We made American great again, and together we can keep it great always!Donation expenditures:100% of all money donated will be put towards re-electing President Donald J. Trump. Funds will primarily be used to create leaflets, mail slips, and renting poster spaces targeting vulnerable districts in the run up to next year's election (including but not limited to Arizona, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). We will keep monitoring advance polling to ensure we are targeting appropriate counties. A first draft design will hopefully be finished by December and a first edition printing should begin by February to ensure enough time to get the message out to undecided voters. The pamphlets will be filled with actual facts highlighting President Trump's first term accomplishments, such as:-Unemployment at it's lowest levels in decades, more Americans are now employed than ever recorded before in our history- Almost 4 million jobs created since the 2016 election, including more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs-Veterans unemployment levels recently reached its lowest rate in nearly 20 years-Successfully confirming 2 supreme court judges with strong conservative convictions-Reforming the tax code to close loopholes and bring corporate money back into the country from foreign nations-Signed the biggest package of tax cuts and reforms in history. After tax cuts, over $300 billion poured back in to the U.S. in the first quarter alone-Rolling back a slew of unjust environmental regulations to allow rural small businesses to expand all across the nation-Opened ANWR and approved Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines-Increased coal exports by 60 percent; U.S. oil production recently reached all-time highs-Supervising an unprecedented period of prosperity, economic growth last quarter hit 4.2 percent overall-Median household income has hit its highest level ever recorded-Renegotiating the NAFTA agreement into the USCMA which greatly improves American production output and encourages a better trade balance in North America-Reached a breakthrough agreement with the E.U. to increase U.S. exports-Pulled out of the TPP and Paris climate accord, two international deals which have done nothing but harm middle class Americans-Imposed tariffs on China in response to China’s forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, and their chronically abusive trade practices-Pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, a disastrous agreement that eased financial sanctions, allowing the tyrannical regime to fund terrorism and pursue a nuclear missile agenda-Took the fist concrete steps to make peace with North Korea, engaging in historic meetings to move the process forward-Moved the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, fulfilling a long standing American promise and pushing the peace talks forward for the first time in years-Increased the military budget to be more in line with figures requested by top generals, securing a record $700 billion in military funding; $716 billion for next year-Taking NATO allies to task for not meeting the required 2% military spending levels-Creating a new branch of the military to deal with emerging threats in the expanding fields of space exploration and orbital access-FDA approved more affordable generic drugs than ever before, and many drug companies are freezing or reversing planned price increases-Secured $6 billion in funding to fight the decades long opioid epidemic-State specific information highlighting local issues will be included, but make no mistake; this will be a referendum on President Trump and we will treat it that wayAdditional funds will be used to organize community events across the country depending on volunteer availability. This will include events such as grass root outreach programs, neighbourhood discussion groups, baking competitions, town hall meetings, and church sales. If enough funds are accumulated online discussion boards and social networking pages will also be created to connect concerned conservatives across the nation and mobilize community action. Together we will keep America great always.

I have over 17 years of active Military Service and was medically discharged in June of 2016 as a Master Sergeant from the US Army.I am trying to reach out to as many as people as possible and would like to enlist your help on the matter.  I have started a GoFundMe page to give back to Veterans and their families. I have watched so many Go Fund Me pages raise countless amounts of money without a blink of the eye. Take in point the Go Fund Me page to raise money for the boarder wall.  This page raised over 12 Million dollars in three days by the American people without hesitation.  I have raised 40 Dollars in three days, with very little views. There is no doubt that we have an immigration problem in the United States but we as American people are being held Hostage by the Republican’s and Democrat’s by shutting the government down over true pettiness.  They continue to beat their chest without finding resolution to the problems. Meanwhile holding Americans paychecks at bay until they find a resolution to the problem.I would love for the President of the United States along with Congress and the Senate to fight just as hard for Veterans and their families.  I would love for them to put a Veteran in charge of the Department of Veterans Affairs that will show up to work and help. The issues with the Department of Veterans Affairs have gone way to long without notice. I understand the issues are bigger than one person.  I think we need leadership not liker ship. We need someone to step up and make it right no matter what the cost and fight for all American Veterans and their families. Therefore, I decided to take it upon myself to try and raise money to make the program better.I continue to enlist all the help I can to get the message out to see this move forward.  I would love for the American people to give back without remorse.  The gratitude from Veterans is far more rewarding.  We as American people need to understand that we cannot beat our chest and Demand things. We must be bipartisan and discuss things like adults, educated people, and human beings not like children.I want to thank you in advance for any help that you can give me on this matter. I know it is difficult to find the time to help one person with one agenda.

$0 raised of $55.0M                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/give-flint-michigan-drinkable-water, ,Give Flint Michigan Drinkable Water,"Created December 21, 2018","As Flint, Michigan's water disaster continues, a blueprint to fix the city's lead contamination is being floated by the mayor of the state's capital city.

 

A decade ago, Lansing was able to avoid a toxic tap water disaster in their city by making a decision to initiate a massive lead pipe removal program. It's a solution the city's mayor is advocating to Flint, in order to alleviate a problem that's morphed into a national scandal.

 

""This is a crisis of epic proportions,"" Lansing Mayor Virgil ""Virg"" Bernero told CNBC's ""On the Money"" in a recent interview. ""Those lead pipes have got to go.""

 

 

Back in 2004, Lansing residents began voicing complaints about their water. That led the city to act decisively, Bernero told CNBC. The Democrat has been Lansing's mayor since 2006.

 

""Just like in Flint, some of the citizens were the canary in the mine. They brought it to our attention and we started looking into it,"" he added.

 

Bernero says officials in Lansing ""dug into"" the city's water safety. ""We expected direct answers and we expected positive answers and we didn't get them."" Instead, Bernero said, they got ""rather vague"" answers about lead levels. ""We looked into the testing procedures, and we were not convinced the water was safe.""

 

What followed in Lansing was a 12 year project to remove about 14,000 lead water service lines, at a cost of $42 million dollars, and replace them with copper lines. The money to replace the pipes came from a capital improvement fund paid for by the utilities' customers through their water rates.

 

The program is scheduled to be completed next year.

 

""We started asking about lead, and what is the safe level of lead, and there isn't one, especially for kids,"" the mayor said. ""So we said the prudent thing to do is to improve the testing and start getting these lead pipes out. Get the lead out.""

 

Now Lansing is trying to help Flint follow their lead to ""get the lead out,"" Bernero said. ""Because we've done it in Lansing, we've sent our crews over to Flint.""

 

He said that, along with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, they've designed a lead pipe replacement plan ""where we think it can be done in a year, with about 30 crews and $55 million dollars."" He added that pipe replacement could cost as little as ""3 to 4 thousand dollars a home.""

 

Bernero explains that's because instead of digging a huge trench from the street to each home, ""we perfected a system of threading instead of trenching."" That involves digging a hole by a house, then pulling up the lead pipes as copper pipe is pulled through.

 

""You thread it through like you would thread a needle. And it cut the time and money in half to replace these pipes,"" he said.

""No' to new governor run

Last week, the Michigan attorney general announced criminal charges against two state environmental officials and the city employee who ran Flint's water treatment plant. The three are accused of allegedly misleading regulators about the lead crisis.

 

Separately, Governor Rick Snyder proposed the state enact tougher lead-testing rules than the federal EPA standard. The Republican also pledged he would drink Flint tap water daily for the next 30 days.

 

Bernero, however, told CNBC he was not impressed. ""The Governor says 'I'll drink the water for a month. I'll prove its safe.' [but] he'll drink filtered water,"" Bernero said. ""He wants to do a publicity stunt and these folks (in Flint) are out there living with it, day in and day out.""

 

In 2010, Bernero was the Democratic nominee for governor, but lost the election in 2010 to Snyder.

 

Is he planning of challenging Snyder again? ""I am not"" he told CNBC, ""and I have been meticulous about not attacking the Governor.""

 

Still, Bernero did say for any lead pipe removal plan to get started in Flint, ""There has to be an element of urgency that should be led by the Governor.Governor.""

President Trump’s main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he’s followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still. As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today. Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of  the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT!It’s up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling. “If the 63 million people who voted for Trump each pledge $80, we can build the wall.” That equates to roughly 5Billion Dollars, even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this. Democrats are going to stall this project by every means possible and play political games to ensure President Trump doesn’t get his victor. They'd rather see President Trump fail, than see America succeed.  However, if we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jumpstart things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians. This won’t be easy, but it’s our duty as citizens.

According to testimonials by well-regarded professionals and professors, my strategy is at least worth considering and might work. It's especially worth considering after the midterms. Sociopathic people often become increasingly more desperate and destructive when they are backed into a corner.  Add that, at present, there's no other at least reasonable strategy for stopping Trump quickly that's compelling. You can read the Preface/Introduction, the Testimonials online, and other parts online. The Preface/Introduction answers the many objections that often come to mind when first hearing about this book. To read parts of the book, go to Amazon.com, type the title, ""A Christian's Intervention for Trump,"" and in the next window, click on the word, ""paperback,"" and in the next window, click on the words, ""Look inside."" For you convenience, I've included the Preface below.The funds will pay for a press release by the prestigious firm, PressReleasePoint, and a book review for Kirkus Magazine, the standard for book reviews. The funds will also pay for buying author's copies and mailing them to various key leaders who are adamant that something must be done to stop Trump ASAP, people like Bill Maher and Bret Stephens who argue that even if he loses the 2020 election, he will still be a major force for damaging America. My intervention proposes to either ruin his reputation enough that he can no longer be a political force or engage him in a process of transformation that has been successful with people like him.PREFACE/INTRODUCTION:  The Intervention and Answers to Criticisms of ItI think I have another ‘i’ word. It’s intervention. I think an intervention is really needed here. US House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi commenting on the suggestion to impeach TrumpThere are two Trumps. The one he presents to the world is all bluster, bullying and certainty. The other, which I have long felt haunts his inner world, is the frightened child of a relentlessly critical and bullying father and a distant and disengaged mother who couldn’t or wouldn’t protect him. Tony Schwartz, co-author with Donald Trump of The Art of the Deal.Here’s who this book is for. It’s focused for anyone who wants to stop Trump from doing the kinds of harmful things he’s doing to America and the world. I show how leaders in various walks of life and the public can contribute to this effort.This book is also for people interested in the cutting-edge finding that a morality, justice system, psychology, and spirituality/religion based on empathy is an idea whose time has come. This book focusses on affecting Trump and Left-Right politics in the bargain. But empathy’s involvement in morality, etc. pervades all aspects of that focus.Barack Obama is the first American President to herald the importance power of empathy to change people. But he was only talking about a simple version of empathy, standing in other people’s shoes to understand them. And he said he had no ability to empathize with severely destructive people. This book takes the simple version of empathy much further by advocating credible empathetic insight based on thorough analysis. In this book’s understanding of religion, God is the Ideal Empathizer, as well as the ideal embodiment of love and compassion. And ideal empathy begins with an intellectually and emotionally compelling understanding of every person, even and perhaps most importantly, people like Trump.During the past year, everyone to whom I briefly introduced this intervention thought it couldn’t possibly work. And that’s putting the point mildly. They thought that at least some parts of this book’s strategy were “ridiculous,” not at all worth considering. And the people who read this current version of this book agreed but were not as vehement. However, when I discussed their criticisms of this book, they changed their minds and thought this strategy for stopping Trump is worth wide consideration. Surprisingly, I discovered that, to convince people who read this book but had lingering doubts, I didn’t have to tell them anything that’s not in this book. I only had to remind them of what’s in it. That means to me that this book’s strategy is complex and its insights unfamiliar enough that it’s difficult to grasp and retain some parts of it on first reading. To deal with the likelihood that even brilliant readers’ will forget significant parts of this intervention after reading this book, I highly recommend what a few draft readers did. Using the detailed Table of Contents, they found the parts of the book that spoke to their criticisms and re-read them. That changed their minds and enabled them to encourage broad consideration of this book’s strategy. Because many objections to this intervention come up early—as soon as one reads the title—and often, I help by, in this Preface/Introduction, initially answering all the major criticisms I’ve heard. During the year that I shared this book’s strategy with law professors, psychoanalysts, journalists, clergy, and non-professional people, they were relentless and sometimes ruthless, and I’ve distilled there criticisms. I’m at jhm4220@gmail.com ready to discuss any still lingering criticisms.First, here is an introduction to the steps of the intervention. This section is readers’ reference for reorienting themselves to the steps involved. I include this, mostly because readers of drafts often forgot enough of the steps that they couldn’t make sense of the strategy. It helps to pause at various times during the reading of this book and refer back to this organized list of steps.A.    The Containment Phase.

Isn’t religion ridiculous? p. 18Objection 5: Empathy is a ridiculous tool for affecting a man like Trump—it’s weak and even appeasing. p. 18Objection 6: The word, “empathy,” alone is a stumbling block for most people. p. 20To be fair to this book, readers do have to keep in mind that their assessment of this intervention is based on a transformed Trump, not the trump.1 version, the man who locks kids in cages. It may initially help in this Preface/Introduction to know that at least the psychotherapeutic process laid out for Trump does have support from some highly regarded psychotherapists.Objection 1: This book’s critics’ most challenging objection is that the political situation in America makes it impossible for this intervention to succeed. The challenging political situation is mostly comprised of the following types of people: die-hard, or die-impossible, supporters in the voting public, financial entanglements, and the threat of imprisonment and financial ruin.This “no-punishment” aspect of this intervention obviates the last criticism, and the financial entanglements will lose their influence if in fact Trump does change, partly because a convincingly changed Trump will never want for adequate money and won’t need to be filthy rich. As most people would, if he has to choose between his current superficial, loveless family relationships and great wealth, he will soon choose the former.There are two most relevant kinds of Trump supporters. People who are most ardently Pro-Life and what might be called, “the anti-elitists.” These types of supporters are most relevant to this intervention, because, surprisingly, their support for Trump is most vulnerable.Every time I introduce friends and acquaintances to this book, I always hear, “Conservatives will squelch this intervention.” Here’s one of the most succinct explanations for conservatives’ allegiance to Trump, regardless how many times Trump disgusts them. And this explanation helps specify why conservatives might squelch this intervention. Steve Deace, a Christian radio talk show host, explained evangelical Christians’ position. He said,As long as Democrats remain the party of infanticide and ‘bake the cake, bigot,’ there is literally nothing Trump could do to alienate a majority of his evangelical support. [Trump is seen] as the last remaining barrier between them and the Left using the full coercive power of government against their beliefs.The phrase, “bake the cake, bigot,” is the Right’s attempt to mock the liberals who helped force baker, Jack Phillips, to put gay-appropriate decorations on a wedding cake a gay couple asked him to create. Phillips had to close his bakery and then went through a grueling legal that went all the way to the Supreme Court. Conservative are furious at this kind of assault on their sensibilities.Regarding the abortion controversy, consider that the Right is not as unanimous in its opposition to abortion as readers may believe. A Pew Research Center study found that 30 percent of evangelical Christians do not advocate outlawing abortion, and some proportion of the remaining 70 percent are not absolutist. They allow abortions in some circumstances. The combination of non-absolutists and conservatives who don’t want a law against abortion does seems significant. It seems likely that now, with Pence as Vice President, the strong suspicion evoked by the evidence Trump raped a minor can move enough conservatives to support this intervention.Note that many commentators on the Left believe that Pence would be better for America than Trump. I present their argument in Appendix E.Among the “anti-elitists” are voters who believed that liberals just don’t care about their main concerns, especially employment. They believed Trump that he was a true populist who was determined to create jobs. As numerous journalists are now reporting, the job-focused voters who sided with Trump during the 2016 elections are no longer as committed to him as they were then. They mostly are realizing that his economic proposals benefit the rich too much. Many of these mostly middleclass people believe they aren’t any better off financially than they were prior to the election. And their concerns about his sexually assaultive behavior and verbal trashing of anyone with whom he disagrees are intensifying.This book claims that the second kind of “anti-elitist” voter, the kind that recoils against people like Phillips being called a bigot is perhaps the most important potential constituency for stopping Trump as soon as possible. I argue that the Left and the Right are trapped in a degenerating vicious cycle of hostility. And I show that the Left is in the best position to unwind this conflict by admitting that it’s intolerance of the Right is a significant part of hostile relations in American politics.The Left’s intolerance of the Right is keenly felt by conservatives. In Atlantic Monthly, Mckay Coppins quoted Russell Moore, a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention, in the service of helping liberals to reconsider what’s perhaps helpfully described as their “neo-intolerance.” The Left does alienate the Right by calling conservatives “bigots.” Mckay wrote, “‘It was only a matter of time,’ he [Moore] said, ‘before cultural elites’ scornful attitudes would help drive Christians into the arms of a strongman like Trump. I think there needs to be a deep reflection on the Left about how they helped make this happen.’” This book helps to further that deep reflection.In Chapter 4, I help readers consider each side’s reasons for their anger. And I offer empathetic solutions to this conflict. Liberal readers’ who claim that that the Right is impossible to reach perhaps will reconsider their pessimism. Perhaps they will be more optimistic about reaching the Right when liberals read in Chapter 4 evidence that hate group members are being helped to give up their hatred relying solely on empathetic methods.I show that liberals can change America dramatically by expanding the boundaries of their empathetic understanding to include, well, everybody. Most pointedly, they must learn that calling people “racist” is character assassination. “Racist” inevitably connotes “stupid,” “mean-spirited,” and, perhaps most upsetting, basically inferior. The implication that the Left thinks the Right is inferior is perhaps the most widespread basis of the Right’s contention that the Left is “elitist.” It would help if the Right said, “You’re saying we’re inferior to you, and you want us to listen to you when you argue for your political position—forget it!!!”Evidence that at least some conservatives who voted for Trump will support this intervention happened on CNN’s program, Pulse of the People, in a segment called, “Independent Voters’ Midterm Election Motivation.” The success of anti-Trump Democrats in the Midterm election itself added to this evidence. But the before and after stories of the CNN interviews of six people are perhaps most compelling. Five of them were life-long Republicans, and one of them was a registered Independent. All of the five Republicans voted for Trump in 2016. And all six of them are now, in the Fall of 2018, adamantly against Trump, and all of them planned to vote a straight Democratic ticket in the Midterms.The intensity of their feelings against Trump seems especially persuasive. Anthony Miles, a proverbial older white male, said of Trump, “We’ve got a very crazy man driving the train, and he’s going to kill this country.” Miles also said that he was contributing money to Democrats across the country despite never having contributed any money to any campaign. Sydney Cohen sincerely apologized for her vote for Trump, apologized for having, in her words, “enabled this monster to destroy democracy, to destroy everything that’s good in this country”Objection 2: In casual conversations with people I meet, I almost always here, “Trump’s a sociopath, and sociopaths can’t change.” This book offers proof that the idea that sociopaths can’t change is a myth. In Chapter 5, there are true stories of certified sociopathic men, violent career criminals who changed into mostly compassionate, pro-social people mainly by means a combination of containment and empathetic treatment. And in Chapter 6, I lay out various possible therapeutic conversations and techniques for use with Trump, some of which include imagined therapeutic conversations with him. Again, the psychotherapists who read this book say that this therapy is a credible method for transforming Trump.After showing that sociopaths can and do change, my many conversationalists who discussed this book with me move the goal posts. I imagine that many readers began this section believe that sociopaths don’t/can’t change significantly but now would move the goal posts.People have, said, “Okay, maybe sociopaths can change, but Trumps not at all like the two guys in your book. Trump’s so tightly wrapped in a life of privilege and power that the stories of the above mentioned two men are irrelevant to him. But a well-worn truism in Alcoholics Anonymous is relevant. It’s that there are bankers and paupers in their midst. Wealthy types who have been chastened by life do become amenable to getting help. Moreover, if one takes seriously the prospect that Trump can change, his financial entanglements will recede in importance. In the new perspective of a deeply changed Trump, being at the pinnacle of economic well-being isn’t attractive. Perhaps people who think that Trump is welded to the lure of great wealth overestimate the power of that lure relative to the power of genuine love and respect that this intervention offers to him. What would each reader do if faced with this choice between great wealth and the love of family and friends?Objection 3: A major criticism of this book’s strategy begins with the fact that the mainstream media didn’t even report the rape allegation. The many people I’ve talked with about this book note this lack of reporting and conclude, “So the allegation must not be credible.”I’ve been told by two highly regarded journalists that, in a case involving someone of the stature of a presidential candidate, they will only publish if they have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And that level of proof doesn’t exist yet in this case. But there’s a reasonable alternative criterion that journalists use in other cases, most notably in the case of Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced movie mogul. Most recently, Weinstein was accused of sexual assault against a 16-year-old, and many earlier sexual assault allegations were made against him. Presumably, the media published these allegations because these allegations met another, less strict criterion—“investigatory credibility.”Chapter 2 shows that the evidence that Trump raped the 13-year-old obviously has what police call “investigatory credibility.” It’s the level of credibility needed to justify the time and expense of an investigation. And as in the Weinstein case, this level of credibility does convict alleged perpetrators in the court of public opinion. This kind of conviction is especially likely regarding alleged perpetrators who already have, pardon the pun, exposed themselves in public as sexual predators, as Trump has on the Access Hollywood audio tape. He said that he frequently groped women and tried to seduce married women.In view of the viability of this lessor criterion for reporting an allegation, it’s difficult to understand the mainstream media’s lack of reporting of this rape case. That’s especially true when one reads all the evidence. Most difficult to understand is the lack of reporting of a particularly apparent set of facts regarding this case. In early October of 2016, one month before the election of Trump, an award-winning attorney filed a civil suit alleging the rape on behalf of the alleged victim. Another award-winning attorney was contacted to conduct the litigation when the trial would happen. The suit was filed and accepted by a judge in Manhattan District Federal Court. Why the media didn’t report this event is especially difficult to understand and a worthy subject of the investigation this book may instigate.Based on many conversations with relentless critics of earlier drafts of this book, it’s easy to imagine that, at this point, readers may now be fulminating with more and more detailed objections.Objection 4: How about the Christian part implied in this book’s title? The author is an ordained Presbyterian clergyman. And, along with Bill Maher, the talk show host the author greatly admires, many people believe that all religion is ridiculous. Actually, he doesn’t indict all members of all religions. He just doesn’t talk much about the admirable people in religion he knows, such as Cornel West, the fiery Harvard Theology School professor Maher often has on Real Time. By not talking about the Cornel West’s of religion, Maher leaves the impression that all of members of religions are ridiculous. So for Maher and other critics of religion, there’s more than a little cognitive dissonance that will happen when they consider reading this book.It should be obvious that all liberal religious people, of which there are millions, are adamantly against Trump. Based partly on this little-known but actually widespread confluence of interests throughout religions—a commitment to all mainstream religions and a tough stance on Trump—this book challenges the widespread liberal prejudice against religion.Without intending to challenge this prejudice, I present evidence and argument that inadvertently does challenge it. Near the end of Chapter 1, readers will see evidence that Christians and other religious people have been responsible for some of the most humane developments in history. The main point isn’t to promote religion or religious people.Objection 5: The main point addresses the next major criticism, that empathy is a ridiculous tool for affecting a man like Trump—it’s weak and even appeasing. The main point is to show that empathy is so powerful that civilization is evolving toward a reliance on empathetic insight to understand and solve the psychological/spiritual part of all of humanity’s problems. And it just so happens that many of those empathetic solutions have been manifested by ordained members of various religions.The idea that empathy is an unrecognized force for humane behavior is a challenge to prevailing morality and its reliance on punishment, of which guilt and shame are the front-line enforcers. Hence the subtitle, The Dawn of an Empathy-Based Morality. Were it not for the need for brevity, I would have tacked on to this subtitle, Justice System, Psychotherapy, Theology, Spirituality, and more.At the beginning of Chapter 1, readers will see opinion and the beginnings of evidence that prevailing morality is not only not helping solve our problems but is implicated in causing them. Guilt and shame, some social scientists now believe, cause rather than prevent and solve behavior problems.This big idea is addressed throughout this book. In Chapter 3 on empathetically explaining Trump’s horrible behavior, I show how he was brainwashed to believe that he’s a worthless person. Put more dramatically, he was made to believe that he deserves only hatred. And all of his bad behavior is desperate reaction to self-hatred, the extreme of guilt and shame.The detailed case stories of two professionally diagnosed sociopaths, or anti-social personality disordered people, presented in Chapter 5 help make this case. These dramatic stories make a beginning case that, unthinkable as it may seem, empathetic understanding providing relief of self-hatred is capable of transforming even violent criminals.That chapter sets up my final chapter, the chapter on how to transform Trump. Although the ideas in that chapter are unfamiliar, readers will see that those ideas are rooted in the treatment of other people like Trump, people like the two men whose stories are presented in Chapter 5.The second phase of this intervention will at first seem of no interest to people focused only on stopping Trump. But they may want to consider that this book’s unconditionally empathetic treatment phase will help him, his family, and some of his supporters initially accept this intervention. The benefit for America of trying to help rather than ruin him is to avoid a protracted fight with him that has too many negative side effects. Moreover, as I’ll show in Chapter 6, his transformation will be of benefit to many people, greater benefit than getting rid of him would be. When America deposed President Richard Nixon, his supporters were only strengthened in their resolve to fight back. Whereas I’ll show that this compassionate intervention will involve a significant degree of reconciliation between anti-Trump people and Trump’s most reasonable supporters.Objection 6: The word, “empathy,” alone is a stumbling block for most people. That’s because people know too little about what “empathy” means. “Empathy” means two different but closely related things. The most familiar meaning of “empathy” is “feeling for,” or sympathy, or compassion. I’m not relying on compassion alone. After all, practically no one feels for Trump. Most important, the “feeling for” part of empathy by itself has little power to transform even ordinarily troubled people. It will help skeptical readers to be clear that this book is not about rousing public sentiment for Trump.The less familiar meaning of “empathy” is stepping into the shoes of another person and imaginatively explaining what they say and do. The professional use of this meaning of empathy is to gather practically all explanatory information of what has happened to a person and what they’ve said and done. Then one creates a credible insight, or explanation, of their problem behavior. More simply put, this so-called “cognitive” part of empathy explains behavior. But this explanatory aspect of empathy still can seem too much like the “feeling for” part.When most people hear about the empathetic understanding focus of this book, they say things like, “You want me to understand that creep!? You’re out of your mind.” They’re confusing two meanings of “understanding”—“being tolerant” and “developing a transformative explanation.” Confused? It may help to be introduced to the method of this book’s apparent madness.This book’s reliance on empathetic insight is based on an understanding of the remediable cause of the psychological part of all problems, the cause that, once sufficiently relieved, solves the problem. I explain in Chapter 3 that unrecognized self-hatred is what’s driving Trump’s harmful behavior. In my and some other professional people’s view, self-hate is the inner problem at the root of the psychological part of all human problems. And compassion is the natural antidote to hatred. Accordingly in this book, empathetic explanation’s criteria include both whether the insight makes sense of behavior and also whether it evokes the troubling person’s compassion, his feeling for himself. An empathy-only morality and justice system I have in mind will be difficult to accept. But as I point out in the Epilogue, the goal of a justice system—protection of the people from crime—is not being served well enough by our punishment-based, unempathic system. Perhaps it’s time to consider an alternative."

The decline of absolute communism was inevitable. The outstanding reasons as any businessman or woman worth their salt could see were by no means insidious in developing and that communism was dooming itself and from inception it had been flawed. Marxism and Leninism espoused theories on government that were based solely on self-supporting systems, or, one that was more one-sided than pragmatic. In other words, they felt that their theories and ideology, as well as philosophy were absolutely sound to thwart off any other system of governing and to surpass it economically and politically in its five-year programs. However, both men failed to realize a simple flaw in their theories on communism and its five-year programs. As Napoleon and Hitler both had realized a simple error in trying to conquer the Siberian Arctic freeze and not preparing their troops properly in clothes to withstand the elements of the Arctic cold, they succumbed in the end to their failures to do so. Both Marx and Lenin likewise failed to realize that communism in theory and pragmatism was competing against no one but itself and not the outside economic world and stock markets around the world that controlled the bartering of world oil, gas, gold, platinum, silver, grain foods and natural resources of countries, as well as imports and exports commodities of countries. By not adhering to a capitalist regiment of any kind and ways of doing things in an open world market that was orientated from its inception in a capitalist mode of world trade and daily transactions, communism and its five-year programs had no one to compete against but itself. World trade is capitalistic in makeup and not socialistic. Remember, you sell to the highest and lowest bidders, not as one of absolute communism that does not know the value of a world market and that of free trade, whereas, under communism the state dictates what is sold and not sold and how it is sold and for how much. Communism had no other major political parties to compete against in Russia. We all know that no country is self-sufficient in all natural resources and must trade with other countries to get those things it needs for its vital existence. Communism has no means of competing with world trade because of the very esoteric structure of it economic system that relies on socialist programs and ideology. Five-years programs for crops and factories production were sometime favorable, but viable ways of dealing with world trade centers were not there because the designers of communism forgot about the two most important things there are in transacting business, the entrepreneur, and the ownership of private property, whereby, the state gave the people the right of ownership of property and merchandise, as well as the right to have their own businesses as long as they do not interfere with state functions. Communism puts the major industries and businesses in the hands of government control and not that of private enterprise. Thus, commodities produced in five-year communist programs would have to go through the world market to be sold and avoid being underbidded by other countries. However, the communists were not gifted as capitalists in gaining buyers for their products. In short, the world stock markets are capitalist in makeup and exploitations. Communism does not believe in capitalist ideology and ways of doing things. Thus, five-year programs would fail for the simple reasons traders at home could not get what they wanted on paper for their programs, and a time limit placed on programs would not allow such five-year programs to always work out because of the capitalist orientated world free trade market and its ups and downs. Many Russian government workers and private citizens could not get paid for their work because of this, slowly dividing the country.From the beginning of world trade and barter, mankind has always traded and bartered in gold or other comparable commodities and precious stones. In short, money or precious stones that represented it are our chief means of world trade and has been from the inception of men trading with one another. Socialism does not believe in capitalism or bothers with how it works, but their own constitutions and laws that espouse a communist politburo or one of socialism in makeup omitting capitalist free trade and the understanding of how money works as we see today in Russian satellite countries trying to understand the capitalist system and world trade markets. Any government, be it capitalist or socialist, must have a budget and must have daily business transactions. In short, a government dealing in world trade must understand the basic principles of capitalism and what is right and wrong for it. In short, a government is a business. How could Marx and Lenin both overlooked this simple aspect that any mediocre private entrepreneur would tell you is the epitome of doing business in bartering and trading. On paper, communism is a beautiful system, or so it seems. But in actuality, it would be almost impossible for communism to survive without some form of capitalism and capitalistic knowledge of its functioning in the competitive capitalist world of free trade. In pragmatism, absolute communism does not work, only on paper.At the same time many cannot see the failures of capitalism around the world as a viable means of fighting off world economic decay. Whereas, capitalist countries are slowly digging their graves due to rising inflation, unemployment, recessionary periods and depressionary ones that are getting longer, and a sedentary lifestyle that leads to obesity and many other health problems. Under the capitalist system as outlined, a handful of people, usually less than ten-percent of it populace, control the wealth and stock markets of a country. This is not only true in America but capitalist countries throughout the world, whereby a handful of people decide the economic stability of that country’s wealth and well being. The masses often beg for food, clothes and medical treatment of some satisfaction, as well as jobs and housing. The failure of the absolute capitalist system envisioned by its forefathers and many, coincides with absolute communism failure as being a viable system in the long run and is inevitably doomed for failure. It would destroy itself because capitalism believes in the greatest profit (at any cost, be it war, stealing, mendacity and deception, slavery, caste system, colonialism, etc) for the lowest wages being paid out to laborers. By out competing bidders, one reaps the cream of the crop. Marx said that artisans prostitute their skills and labor out to the greatest bidders of pay for them. Marx wanted to do away with the bourgeoisie, which is needed for trading. In the United States we see jobs by the millions being lost to foreign countries in Asia, Africa, South America and countries that have no minimum wage laws whereby workers can earn a profitable pay from their labor. World trade and labor forces see capitalism slowly destroying western country after country from the lost of jobs and technology of capital countries to other countries that can provide the cheapest labor for the highest of profits for businesses and corporations. This cycle of capitalist countries losing jobs and wealth at home for its workers, and slowly becoming desperate for finances for themselves, will not go away, but persist as you are seeing today. It should be obvious to any high school student that the United States had to change much of its rhetoric and programs concerning capitalism making them more applicable and viable to those of socialism, believe it or not. In example, Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal had to adopt many socialist programs and even socialist ideology as far as governing, in order to save the United States during the Great Depression that started in 1929, or so they say. Without implementing programs like the WWW, WPA, public housing laws for the poor, as well as public welfare, social security laws, government intervention into how banks are regulated; transportation laws for the highways, as well as government intervention into military life and its integration, the United States would be much different today as a nation. Even the names of many of these programs that still exist from the Rooseveltian era, utilizes the word social, connoting socialism in its meaning and early forms. Rich people do not as a rule spend their wealth on public programs for masses because even though they are rich, they still can not come up with yearly income for such programs, whereby, the government collects it through taxation from its populace. In the last fifty years or so in the United States, we have seen big government hands into how things are being ran at home. Government bureaucracy, likewise, is getting out of hand here in America. There is simply too much red tape in doing business with the United States government. At the same time, many cannot see the failure of the capitalist system around the world in its absolutionism, slowly coming apart. Whereby, capitalist countries of Europe and the Americas are slowly coming apart, and the inflation of goods, unemployment, recessions and depressions are as real as the people that experience them. Even in America the richest country in the world economically, we see many going hungry and several thousand cases of people dying of starvation are reported yearly, but not publicized my the media for fear of how it would make American propaganda look abroad and to the rest of the world. Here’s a country that gives away billions each year in food and foreign aid, but will not feed its own citizens, but let them layup and starve to death. First lady, Mrs. Bush, goes on national television in ads asking the American people to help feed and clothes its poor, unbelievable, but true.By combining socialism (government control of major industries, transportation, utilities, banks and other businesses that control a high percentage of the GNP) and capitalism, we come at a realization of what CapSoc (Capitalist-Socialist Party Of America) is all about. Here, a rotation of power to city-states types of governments must be realized to ensure its success. This in no way violates any country’s laws that are based on democratic vote and freedom of expression. Abuse of CapSoc is not permitted or the degradation of any country or people. CapSoc adds to the dignity of mankind and people that believe in an equality of life, and a government free from tyranny, despots, and any kind of totalitarian state. In short, any country is as good as its laws that govern it and those that carry out those laws are its safeguard against any internal or external forces that would abuse them. CapSoc uses the highest forms of leadership based on morality that governs us. CapSoc does not adhere to past records of it followers, but a pledged-vow of allegiance. Those that govern us have made mistakes like those it rule over, an understanding of what is right and wrong is needed to safeguard those rights and liberties as put forth and advocated by CapSoc. Our leadership is never based on Machiavellian philosophy, but sound morality as put forth by those who believe in ethics and a fair government for the people. CapSoc sets out its laws, principles of morality for its public officials. (*1 CapSocs Manual of Ethics) Our rank is not broken by any and any hanky-panky like tampering with votes, human and legal rights, property, and wealth is not out objectives. CapSoc never tolerates stealing and killing, discrimination, maltreatment of people. CapSoc does believe in resistance when subversive people arise to meet that need, however. Those that have the gaining of personal wealth and personal power are not true CapSocs. In America, we have only a two-party system, whereby, the Democrats and Republicans play political football with our lives. Here we find much deceit, mendacity by government, stealing and many other crimes by government to it citizens, and many unaware of what is going on at city, state and federal levels of government. The United States is being stolen blind at all levels of government. This is being publicized more and will continue to be alarming to many citizens. CapSoc will be the third-political party in America giving the people another choice of governing themselves. CapSoc has a judicial, legislative and executive make-up. The congress will only supercede city and state when it feels laws or political actions are warranted to insure equal and impartial justice and administration. CapSoc puts less emphasis on the executive and federal levels; the city-state orientational approach is desired with the executive and other branches of government looking in on them. Then, under CapSoc, your government officials at the lower levels of government are as well trained and knowledgeable of government as those at the top of government. When fighting a cancerous tumor, one goes to the source of that tumor to eradicate it at whatever means. By controlling the growth of this tumor, one thwarts its growth, being able to destroy it. You don’t put your best technicians and doctors in the operating room at the last moment, but to use them early and not to lead to a more serious problem. Broader power is given to mayors, councilmen, aldermen, city and county agencies. Why? To stop any situation from getting worst, you go to it at the most earliest of opportunities. This rotation of power from the upper levels of government to lower government officials must have the best workers to carry out social programs. Upper levels of government will continue to advise and offer ideas and programs, but it is at the grassroots of government that these programs are implemented as we see much failure in the federal government today in America in carrying out many of its social programs due to mismanagement of funds, stealing of money and merchandise, discrimination, etc. CapSoc is not giving its power entirely to the city-states and doing away with the other levels of governmental powers, but the emphasis of power is being rotated more to the city-states where many of the problems originate in governing the masses. The executive and federal branch of government, as well as congress (legislature) will still have the highest powers of authority, only paying more attention to the city-states that has gained power in implementing programs. Hence, the federal government and bureaucracy will set up offices and headquarters in city-state communities to overseer and gain more knowledge of what is going on throughout the city-state communities. Likewise, would the governors of city-states have power over the city-states governments, but would act as a perfunctionary of overseeing executive level policies being carried out as implemented through the city-state programs. Their powers would be in outlining these programs with the city-state executive branch of government. A state budget would be no more than the cost of running the city-state government as outlined by the higher branches of government that has the final say. Legislature representation of the state would meet the same fate, no more than a safeguard of the city-state system of that state. Power is being giver to the city-state government through the upper branches of government. It is the people who make a government; therefore, the power must start with them in a democratic society. Government workers only carry out the peoples wishes of how they are to be governed under CapSoc. The people make public servants.All laws must be given the final vote of approval by the federal and executive and legislative branches and not states. The city and state must adhere to these laws. We can see all around us the chaos of each states laws and how they cause us so much trouble and money being spent on them in implementation of these laws. Discrimination in any law makes them unsound, if not unjust to those under it. *CapSoc Party believes in unity of state laws and their conformity. For each state to have their own judicial laws would make room for a lot of headaches at the upper echelons of government as we see all around us the burden that the federal government is carrying to overseer state laws and regulation, often the federal government must implement its owns laws to overseer how states are being ran. We see this in businesses like airplanes, trains, highways laws and money to build them; ships at sea, housing, schools, hospital programs such as Medicaid, Medicare; hence, the federal and executive branch of government in America must overseer much of what the state does in many of its programs as mentioned. To deny a person the rights given another because of locale is unjust. This is absurd when one weighs this with the impartiality of justice that the federal government is to adhere to. How can a government be impartial when each state has its own laws that it goes by? It is the duty of national government to have a check and balance on laws and rights of the individual within each state and city. Our legal system is very chaotic and biased in performance to the blindness of justice one is to receive; and this becomes more apparent on the appeal of laws at the state and federal level, showing the ineptness of the system.[1] Thus, have the United States government and United States Supreme Court implementing for e.g., civil rights laws that are impartial to all states, as well as commerce laws, criminal laws, etc.CapSoc is unique in that it places the power in the hands of those that need it and would best implement laws of the land and would likewise have a first hand knowledge of how things are being ran. Under CapSoc, the private ownership of property and merchandise that one works for would still exist. Innately, human beings desire ownership of some kind of property or merchandise and will do almost anything to obtain this personal ownership of commodities. Private ownership of property and merchandise is also a necessity for its survival in the world free trade and marketing. It is the epitome of free trade and what people around the world work for: something to call their own, and at the same time keep that identity of individuality. Working for something to call your own is inspiring and enhances the will of the creative person and does not hinder freedom of expression. Under CapSoc the vital industries to a country (transportation, utilities, major industries and corporations, medical programs, etc) are placed in the hands of the government to ensure that the people will get the best for their tax money and not being monopolized by private ownership disrupting normal usage of these vital industries. We have seen in capitalistic countries where private ownership of public utilities has caused excessive and unfair rates. Government intervention is always needed to offset the greed of many capitalist pigs that monopolize all at any price or consequences for the masses. Strikes that can cripple corporation and nations must be offset by government intervention, especially when they are of vital needs like energy, transportation, utilities, housing, etc. Mankind has not learned to know when to stop greed, avarice of capital for a handful and not benefiting the masses. People are at a mercy to wealth and power and must be legislated into putting the essentials of life and others first and not themselves. History has shown us that society and a country will fail in the end when this is not checked.In countries like England, France, Italy, United States and Germany, we see socialist parties and forms of it in governing the people going on. These socialist parties work along side capitalist ones in establishing fair play for it citizens. These countries would be in economic decay if not for socialist programs being adopted by the masses to keep them going and compensate for the inadequacies of the capitalist national budgets that fail to solve the social problems of a nation. This is not a misnomer, as socialist parties and programs have grown tremendously in recent years throughout Europe and the world. Many people around the world are realizing that large private industry will not take care of the masses in the long run, but put money into rich peoples’ coffers. It is the people who must support their own efforts to proper representation of people to public offices to carry out their programs and social efforts. Both socialism and capitalism are here to stay, but there must be symmetry of both; although in the long run socialism will predominate as the favorite government to adhere to and live under simply because of its pragmatism. Socialism came before capitalism anthropologists tell us because the small world population had little need for want of food and clothes. It was only when population changed and avarice that earlier rulers did little to satisfy the masses with the same wealth they had amassed. Capitalism is more of a one-on-one, whereby, socialism represents the control of a larger body of people. However, both systems go way back in time, although called otherwise. To use both capitalism and socialism would form the most powerful government the world has ever seen. If the world was once destroyed by water, (flood) people will succumb to one based only on capitalism or socialism alone. In short, if people cannot see the viableness of a system and way of life, they will simply not accept it, but fall with their fallibilities. It is up to the people and no one else to decide their future as to what type of government they will live under. Capitalism is an intrinsic way of life, as is social programs for the masses altruistically and osmotically with us. This is CapSoc in essence, the realization of both capitalism and socialism within a nation. CapSoc believe as well in the American dream of self-expression and the freedom of a people, no matter how different that belief may be. We defend those rights of all men to aspire to their personal goals.In the treatment of many diseases one drug or therapy is in itself not a cure or alleviation of that ailment, but a combination of drugs and more than one type of therapy is needed. Most serums for cures of our ailments will not stand alone if only one drug or component is used, but a combination of other drugs and their components do we perfect a cure and a remedy to what ails us. Isn’t it about time we applied some of this same logic, reasoning, to our chaotic political systems and governments around the world? In the last 200 years we have seen governments doing little to cut down on pollution of air, water and land based factories. We find this very true in capitalist countries as well as some socialist countries that place a higher value on their budgets and five-year work programs. Both systems blame one another for the pollution of the earth. It is obvious that both are at fault due to the oversight and failures by both to set down proper guidelines against pollution and the destroying of green plant life. Our ecological environment must be safeguarded if we are to live here on planet earth, as few environment scientists would tell you otherwise. We must ask ourselves can we continue to live this way? Or, is there other alternative to resolving us from digging our own graves?CapSoc emphasizes health and ecology first. Would you burn down your house to live outside in the elements of nature? Non-pollution of environment would not harm economic and social programs of a country but would only help in the long run ensure such programs. Countries would still want to trade in commodities. Look at the billions of dollars the United States, China and Russia loses each year to pollution. This same lost money could easily be used to correct many social programs such as housing, job creations, medical treatments and even income for it citizens. CapSoc emphasizes simplicity. The less bureaucracy we see in government and red tape, the more efficiently that body of government can operate. Mankind has not learned to simplify the things that need simplication, but only complicating them. Intelligent and educated people are coming to realize that the more advance one comes in technology the need for simplicity is most needed. Most people in their college majors, and even if they majored in more than one subject, there are hundreds and thousands of other subjects they are limited in knowledge. Did I call money here? We have created a host of complexities from problems that should not be complex. A conundrum of problems exists in our governments absorbing our governments in a chaotic maze of misery, not only for it citizenry, but those inside government as well. Such a chaotic government breeds waste, greed, poor management and defeat for itself in the end. Just as you check your car for flaws, a government should have a check-and-balance system to overseer its proper maintenance. CapSoc does this in its check-and-balancing at all levels of government. New cabinets under CapSoc are rare since what we call a circle or cycle that revolves to protect itself. The creation of new laws and cabinets only tell one that the system of government is not working. Hence, the same problems are still there, thus, why is a new cabinet or new laws needed to solve those same old problems? Records only represent what you want them to represent.Owenites in England, Debites and Larouchites in America, Marxists in Russia and many other political parties were created to put forth socialist programs and agendas to solve social ills. None of these political parties thought to combine both systems, coexisting as one and not trying to do away with the other. Utopia is always beautiful on paper. Socialism is real as is the science and political system of socialism. The ownership of private property must bring a tax on such property, but at the same time not being excessive. A personal tax on income is not desired under CapSoc. Why? The collection of personal and business and property taxes go back thousand of years. As in ancient times and even medieval times of serf, lords and peons, we saw a disparage in unfairness in such systems, whereby, kings, pharaohs, governors became rich, as masses ate slop and lived likewise. It is always the duty of government to collect taxes. There are many ways government can collect taxes outside the ways they collect them today and in olden days. Kings that did not like adversaries becoming too rich and building armies against them levied enormous taxes against them. Some of the kings human rights foes were imprisoned, killed and even ostracized from the land they had called their own. Under CapSoc there would be no need for such since laws are there to offset such people from building armies and fortunes that take away from the masses and social programs that would do likewise. A person can still have a fortune, being a millionaire or even billionaire, only that his or her wealth does not interfere with the masses and vital programs that are need by the people of a country. In short, the government by it laws sees that the vital programs of a nation are safeguarded and any private wealth takes away nothing from the people and social programs of a country. Under CapSoc the emphasis of a government is to take its taxes right off the top, all money has a tax on it. How can this be so? Business that employed are taxed and not the personal income of a person. Hence, taxes are taken out of business payrolls. There are no tax loopholes as under capitalist systems. Everyone and every business are subjected to taxation in one way or the other. Corporate, private, etc owned businesses are all taxed. Under CapSoc the church must likewise give to Cesar what is his in the form of taxes. The church is a business and has its own government as put forth in its creeds, doctrines and laws. We see in many countries, churches getting government grants and money, but paying no tax money, only taking away from the masses and poor and becoming richer. The church has no conscious when it comes to collecting money from the government, but it will not pay taxes. Then, why interfere in government programs when you do not want to become a part of it? This is being very hypocritical wouldn’t you say? There then, must be a separation of state from all religion, including the catering of churches wanting government money. Alternatively, the church will carry its load as others are doing in paying taxes if it is to receive government money. CapSoc honors the free will of man to worship his or her god. In short, CapSoc is not opposing the freedom of religion, but condoning its freedom of that expression, as long as it does not function within the government in getting it to adhere to its beliefs. This includes religion parties being viable as governing the people, but not the mixing of that religion or church with politics. In short, until the church governs the masses, then, the state has control over how it is being run and how far the church can influence it.Remember, the government is a business and under CapSoc, you, the people, have created this business to help run your daily lives because you cannot work for food and livelihood and try and run the country at the same time. Therefore, you elected to political officials, those you feel can best help you run your daily lives. In addition, in the United States we see billions of dollars being never collected by the government tax agency, as well as many big corporations paying no taxes at all, and of course, the church we just mentioned. In short, the United States government could save billions each year in trying to collect lost taxes and imprisoning people, by adhering to a new way of collecting taxes. The government of CapSoc is not only concerned about its workers, but all aspect of human life that concerns the welfare of its people. The collection of garbage should be just as important as organizing a union or club to benefit workers. Every aspect of life must we be concerned with and what affect every citizen. History has proven mankind motives in the usurping of power of government due to economic and political decay. When the moral decadence of any society is apparent, people have resorted to arming themselves to bring about changes. The bullet or the ballot, people have said, and whichever they felt the more apropos. This is only human nature and sense of survival to live a better life free of tyranny, chaos, moral and economic decay. The masses know when things can be better for them and will act according to bring about that change. At no time does CapSoc advocate violence or armament of others to do so. This comes as only an occurrence of human nature to various situation that call for such, but not being advocate by us, only that all democratic processes are in order. As stated earlier, the people of a country historically have decided this fate and how they should be governed and by what means.A class-conscious society will still exist under CapSoc. There will always be people who want to remain poor for whatever reasons. People wanting wealth will always be with us and there are many that only want to live modestly. Human nature is this way and why tamper with it. No government can force a person to be wealthy or force wealth upon that individual who doesn’t want it. Neither can a country force education or morality upon it people, but only getting them to live within the laws. These things, as many nations are learning, are voluntary, although looking very good on paper when you can say a country is 100% literate, or has a 100% believers in a god. Not even all the angels in heaven believed in their creator. The enactment of laws to prevent poverty, illiteracy and non-belief in that deity, cannot change something as innate as human nature and thought and what that individual desires. It is the governing bodies of a country duty to control these people behavior and lifestyle that is most favorable to the state, not hampering in any way that lifestyle. Here we have the epitome of government function; no one faction is offended by the other, but works in unison as a whole rather than a faction. This is very difficult, as history has shown us.A government must be able to feed its people, provide work for them, housing, medical treatment, as well as controlling those vital industries, corporations, transportation, utilities, etc. Above all, government must inspire its citizens to want to do these things and take the necessary action to do so. Where there is no concern for governmental functions, there is no concern for self. A government is always its people and their concerns.Even a prostitute that sells her body, (commodity) in turns desire ownership of that body. Under capitalism, the prostitute sells her merchandise (body) to the highest of bidders. The socialist buyer of the prostitute likewise wants ownership of that body, even if for a short time. Here we have a paradox, non-utopian of both capitalism and socialism coexisting. It is only human nature in wanting to own something, even if ones body. It is also human nature in wanting to share things with others and to co-exist. Hence, here we find socialism and the government control of major industries and resources to allow all access to them. Capitalism will always coexist in some form even under a socialist regime. Likewise will socialism always be needed to keep a check-and-balance between the rich and poor; not having one hogging all the wealth, and the controlling of vital resources, industries and utilities. Both World War I and II are considered economic wars whereby the countries that perpetuated them were countries lacking in natural resources such as gas, oil, minerals and things it could not obtain at home but had to get from elsewhere. From ancient times, history is redundant in the collapse of countries from inflation, recessions and depressions. The largest world body of peace is the United Nations. It has many agencies including that of world labor and employment, as well as that of world trade. Until world countries agree to establish workable guidelines whereby all countries can satisfactory trade with others, the world will see others wars as World War I and II taking place and over those same things for countries existence. Then, if not the United Nations to help solve problems, we still need some world control on tariffs and international trading of resources and very soon. Even natural water is becoming depleted around the world and this problem must be looked at closely and soon. (*2 The California Water Plan) A handful of nations should never be able to dictate the trade in natural resources and imports to countries, but all nations should be able to decide. Mr. Santyana comes to mind and to paraphrase him: “Those that do not heed the past, will repeat it.” If we are to live here on earth, then, a number must likewise be placed on world population and who we can feed and take care of. Children are born every day to starve to death and die from no medical treatment. In short, we have no way of taking care of them or showing them the love and understanding they should have from parents. Too many of these children are homeless, in poverty, illiterate and diseased. No god meant children to live this way and the degrading and devaluing of human life as we now see it around the world. The economy of a country influences its morality and even religious beliefs. A person who is starving will steal, kill, lie and even perform lewd sexual acts so that he or she might have food to eat or money in their pockets. This is not contrary to human nature that seeks out self-preservation and some means of livelihood in keeping sanity and equilibrium in daily life.We have a duality in our lives and just as evil and good are two good examples of it, capitalism and socialism are two others. Sooner or later capitalism and socialism must realize that they must depend on another, each to the best advantage of the other. This duality is a bond, not a division between the two, but stands as a reinforcement of the other in working in harmony for that nation. Any world government of the future must rely on some forms of socialism to be a viable system. Likewise, capitalism will always exist in some form or another, as there are those who want wealth and those who do not. Human nature and motives will always vary.LET US STAND AS ONE(A song of CapSoc)Let us stand as one,One people under the sun.Our strength is in our unity,Mankind we love and not disunity.Those that hunger and thirst, let them be fed;Those in bondage, freedom shall they be led.Let us stand as one,One people under the sun.CapSoc is for all;And so shall we call.Let the people around the world hear our voice.That they might make a choice,Between what is right and wrong,In freedom we grows strong.Let us stand as one,One people under the sun.Working people around the world unite, In our struggles for peace that we ignite. Our forefathers lay down the groundwork,Let us continue their work. Let us stand as one,Our work to be done.EndEpilogueOne of the most powerful countries in the world has trouble feeding many of its people, as well as clothing and housing them. A decline in jobs and personal check payments has declined. Former President Gorborchev wanting to correct many of the flaws and short comings of communism in Russia, could only concede in the end that communism was not the ultimate governing system for the Russian people, but would need some forms of capitalism and western entrepreneurship to help it out. Countries in Eastern Europe started to distant themselves from her control with the Russian government, because of internal economic ails, being able to do little about it. The worlds trade is based on capitalism in the exchange and the selling of goods, whereby, communism preaches just the opposite; Gorborchev and eastern satellites of Russia realizing the inadequacies of communism (state run and controlled) in competing with capitalist countries around the world. Although Marx and Lenin could produce large momentary economic gains for their system of governing, they would be doomed in the end and long run by the failure of the communist system in competing with capitalist theorists who controlled the world economic marketing trade. Even the Russian space program is suffering from lack of funding.Communism is its biggest enemy in a capitalist orientated free world marketing of goods and finances. It stunts its own growth as Marx and Lenin would soon find out because it has no one but itself to compete against in the marketing and production of goods and not being self-sufficient in natural resources and other commodities. Where parallel competition is needed as a motivator of human competition, it is lacking here. It feeds on itself and not the world market of competition that controls its existence in a capitalist world of free trade; hence, the word Free Trade! Socialism is based on state and non-private ownership; Capitalism offers private ownership and freedom of trade. In brevity, socialism is not designed to compete in a free world market. This was the biggest mistake that Marx and Lenin never realized. In retrospect, it makes one think that neither Marx nor Lenin really understood the world of marketing and the nature of men and women. Marx and Lenin, people only prostitute their bodies and skills because they choose to do so. Their mistake is being felt throughout the world as the U.S.S.R, (now dissolved into several countries) along with other former communist countries are changing their ways of life, adopting more the theories of capitalism and its capabilities; as is capitalism turning more toward socialism in order to survive here in America. Marx and Lenin saw communism in a utopian sense. Utopians of any kind, overlooks one of the most important things, that of human variables, as well as those non-human. Absolute communism was no more than utopian dreams, being unpragmatic in a capitalist world trade market. Marx and Lenin theories were doomed to failure by its very nature and adherence to absolutionism.At the same time, many cannot see the failure of the capitalist system around the world in its absolutionism slowly coming apart. Whereby, capitalist countries of Europe and the Americas are slowly coming apart and the inflation of goods, unemployment, recessions and depressions are as real as the people that experience them are. The CapSoc Party of America at no time tries to make everyone equal. We are only equal in creation. CapSoc though gives everyone an equal opportunity to aspire to their goals of endeavors whatever they may be. To say that all men and women are of the same abilities and desires in life would be deceiving ourselves. Freedom of choice under a democratic functioning is the goal of CapSoc and not to try and make all people equal in abilities, but equality in choice of destiny and goals that are aspired to. *1 CapSoc Manual of Ethics is given to workers of the CapSoc Party.*2 The California Water Plan is a confidential plan to utilize sea water (Pacific Ocean) to help solve the shortage of water in California and other western states, especially those states that use the Colorado River.

Instead, like many other families, are left without pay and scrambling to get food on the table for our children. Yes, we are one of the many families affected by this long Government Shutdown.  I posted a little bit about our situation on Day #24 via social media. It said the following: Day #24 Government shut down. I keep hearing things like 'Federal workers make the big bucks, they should have enough saved up' or 'They knew what they were getting into when they signed up'. This is not true. We are a shut down affected family, this is what we look like. We are not some 'big wigs' who make enough money to own three houses like some are portraying we are. We are a everyday working family, whom, like most working families do, pretty much work paycheck to paycheck because the cost of living is so high. We also have three amazing growing boys, who eat a lot!While most companies are working with Federal Employees to defer payments and such, grocery stores and gas stations are not. Not only are families like mine worrying about food, they are worrying about gas to get to work. My husband drives 70+ miles a day to get to work and gas is expensive in New York. Credit cards can only take so much.. and think of all that interest adding up. Most families pay for childcare, which they still NEED because they are being forced to work without pay. We are a everyday working family, we don't get assistance, we don't qualify for assistance. We also must have good credit to keep our jobs, so missing payments and racking up credit cards puts us in jeopardy. We were just told that if this shutdown extends to the end of the month we would have to pay for our insurance premiums (that typically comes automatically out of our checks) or we lose our insurance.  UPDATE: Health Insurance is working with Federal Employees. However, Dental and Vision still need to be paid. (About $150-$200 a month per family) How do we come up with this? Federal workers can not strike, its illegal. My husband can not just walk off his job, it puts the public safety at risk. Not only that, he has so much invested into his job, we can't afford to lose it. Its simply stressful. Do we need a wall? That is all in a matter of opinion, but using families like mine as pawns in this battle for it is not ethical.Before all your political comments come about the wall, I am not republican, I am not democrat, I am not a liberal. I am a woman with a family trying to make a decent living, that's what is most important. Please friends and family, when you think about this shut down, think about families like mine. Be kind with your words, it's not easy for us..Well, that was January. Now we are heading into February and our savings has run out, credit cards are taking a beating and we are left with only hope that this will end.   Dental and Vision still needs to be paid. Gas to get to work still needs to be available and our children need to eat! My goal, on top of a fundraiser I will be doing, is to have enough to get my family through February along with helping out a few other local families.  This is the worst case scenario.. we are WORKING families, we don't like handouts. But it has unfortunately come to this, anything will help! Thank you so much for your support, you have no idea how much it is greatly appreciated <3 "

She is a dedicated federal employee and mother to her children. The funds raised will be used to purchase food, pay rent and other bills, as well as assist with day to day expenses. Federal employees were supposed to get paid today and they, unfortunately, did not receive the income that is critical to their survival. There are many of us who are experiencing our own hardships or troubles right now but it's absurd that families like my friends' are being affected by the political battle being waged between the President and the Democrats over a wall. My friend wants to go back to work. She is used to working and supporting herself and family. I wish I had the money to help my friend out right now but I know that we have a nation of caring and supportive people who are willing to step up to the plate to help a family in need. I am grateful for every person who helps out my friend, and I know she is grateful to.

While politicians are wasting energy debating funding walls, that would cost billions, graduates are being crippled by student loan debt with high interest rates.As a college graduate, I understand the many challenges graduates are facing. Crippling debt is delaying our ability to live on our own, get married, buy a home, have children and contribute to the growth of the U.S. economy. Too many Americans are being held back because politicians are neglecting to address the student loan crisis.It is time that the American people come together to do the job that our elected officials are not. Eliminating student debt would have profound effects on the stability of the U.S. economy and alleviate an entire generation who is drowning in student loan debt.“1.5 Trillion is a daunting task, but if we unite as one we can make a significant impact on student loan debt.”Student debt is not Democrat nor Republican and affects an entire generation and more. By coming together and working to lower the mounting national student loan debt, we would be doing a great service to our county.This is not easy, but it is a moral duty to help those in need. By sharing this each day the hope is that the national spotlight will be shifted away from border walls and focused more on issues facing many Americans."

$0 raised of $5.0M                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/artkidney,"Orange Park, FL",Artificial Kidney Research Funding,"Created December 20, 2018","Hello. My name is Michael and I, like millions of other people, have Kidney Disease.Before reading any further, I’d like you to know that these funds are not being raised for me but for us. While you may not have Kidney Disease or know anyone that does, I hope to appeal to your compassion and empathy for your fellow Humans enough to consider supporting development of not only a life-saving modern miracle of science, but a vast improvement to the quality of life for many Dialysis Patients. So let’s talk about the Artificial Kidney. The Kidney Project at The University of California, San Francisco is developing a Bioartificial Kidney which will be the size of a coffee cup and can be surgically implanted to treat end stage Kidney Disease.Think about that for a moment. We have come so far in science that we’re able to artificially replace a vital organ that does so much for us including:Maintaining overall fluid balanceRegulate and filter minerals from bloodFilter waste materials from food, medications and toxic substancesCreate hormones that help produce red blood cells, promote bone health and regulate blood pressureWe’ll be able to go from needing a Dialysis Machine which is the size of a small refrigerator and oftentimes located in a medical facility, to having something the size of a coffee cup surgically implanted. I cannot even begin to describe how this not only changes the way we physically treat Kidney Disease but how we start to improve the life of so many people dependent on Dialysis to keep them alive. We’ll eliminate the need for Kidney Disease Patients to have to go through the process of having a Fistula, a blood vessel that is created by connecting an artery to a vein, or if that fails, a neck line, a small tube inserted into a vein in the neck. Kidney Disease patients will no longer have to make multiple trips to Dialysis Centers each week.Waking up will no longer become something to fear. The fear of wondering whether or not Dialysis will work. The fear of whether or not you’ll get a transplant in time. Or the fear that one day, you’ll decide you’ve had enough. I live with the realization that one day, I may have to go through Dialysis and it keeps me awake at night. We’ve come so far as a species that we’re able to do so many wonderful, miraculous things, Dialysis being one of them, but we’re on the cusp of advancing even further.It’s hard to imagine that something as arbitrary as money can stand in the way of such a life changing treatment for so many people.I’d like to share some information about Kidney Disease from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):About 30 million US Adults are estimated to have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and most are undiagnosed.Kidney diseases are the ninth leading cause of death in the United States.48% of people with severely reduced kidney function and not on dialysis are not aware of even having CKD.Every 24 hours, about 340 people begin dialysis treatment for kidney failure.Those are scary numbers just in the US alone. According to the National Kidney Foundation:10% of the population Worldwide is affected by CKD.According to the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study, CKD was ranked 27th in the list of causes of total number of deaths worldwide in 1990 but rose to 18th in 2010. This degree of movement up the list was second only to that for HIV and AIDs.Over 2 million people Worldwide currently receive treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant.It’s not just an American disease, it’s a human disease. We’ve become so tied up with what labels are important to us in society that we’ve lost sight of the connections that bring us all together, our humanity. We can be Democrat, Republican, Black, White, Yellow, Atheist, Christian, Muslim, or Jewish but in the end, we’re all human. Think about what that means and what we can all accomplish together. We’ve raised over $3 million dollars in 3 days to build a wall and while that’s important to a lot of people, I’m hoping that the $5 million needed to fund clinical trials for the Bioartificial Kidney will be just as important. The $5 million will include $2 million that is required for safety testing and $3 million for device testing.To read more details about the Bioartificial Kidney, please visit: The Kidney Project You can also view the progress on the Bioartificial Kidney at: Kidney Project Progress Thank you for taking the time to read our story."

Cass County is one of the fastest grown counties in Missouri. It is becoming a destination spot for people throughout the Metro and surrounding rural areas. Having a museum of the history of Cass County from its inception in the 1830s to today would add to the draw of our county for visitors and tourists. Through a generous donation of a wonderful patron of the Cass County Historical Society, a 9,000sqft building was donated to house just such a museum. Now it is up to us to raise the funds to make it a reality. The building has historical importance in Harrisonville, MO, once housing the printing presses of the Democrat Missourian, Cass County's premier newspaper for more than 150 years. The building is in solid condition, but significant renovations need to take place to make it into a viable museum, archives, and office space for CCHS.

Welcome  to Our     GO Fund Me    website where we explain our 18 year effort and why you should be interested  :-)  :-)If you choose not to donate - we understand - but do choose to understand what we are doing by reading this website.No tricks, no gimmicks - but its a compelling story that you can be a part of if you choose.  Again - no tricks or gimmicks.In 2001  my wife & I started a ""crazy idea"" to find answers to nationwide concerns we  saw regarding our Seniors in the U.S..Now before we go even 1  more paragraph further . . .       Lets define you:    If you are 55 or older               -  you are  a Senior now or will be very soon                                            If you are younger than 55    -  then you will be a Senior in the future.In other words - Certain efforts to benefit Seniors - like ours - will effect you now or later &  your parents or family/children.My wife & I looked for GOOD,   Logical,   Reasonable,  Creative Solutions to solve our country's primary  Entitlement concerns . . .  -  but not with big new tax payer spending or crazy ideas or  ""rose colored glasses""  giveaway  opinions as Congress was doing.  Solutions of common sense & inventive NEW thinking that are also  COST CONTROLLED for Taxpayers. Is not crazy to expect.  But it has seemed like a fantasy to believe Congress could or would do it on their own.   So we started in 2001 to do it for them.But I'm told our efforts have found TOO MANY solutions or we invented too many items or innovations to make it possible.  I've been told readers like yourselves can't understand all our solutions or can get confused by the quantity our husband and wife team offer -  so then  readers don't become donators to our effort.    Many inventors over our 300 year U.S. history have faced the same issues - - - of being told negatives are the only responses to expect.    I'd like to believe everyone isn't so limited if I make better efforts to explain.    Donations is what will keep us working on finalizing these plans.   Is it a compliment we've been told we have too many solutions?    ABSOLUTELY - its nice to hear . . . .  but its still a problem of obtaining  donations to live on while we work for everyone's benefit - - - and its been 18 long years of efforts.    So we've simplified  our GoFundMe story to focus on just 2 goals instead of a dozen we have.  Here are our 2 goals to start with and I'll include a limited number of graphics to explain as well : Goal number ONE1.  Find methods to Reduce ""Entitlement costs"" in the U.S.  -  SPECIFICALLY   Social Security,  Medicare,  and Medicaid.Our concerns of 2001  are coming true  quickly .  .  .   just late in 2018  the Majority Leader of the U. S.  Senate  publicly confirmed in many media interviews -  the U.S. must focus SOON on reducing  certain  ""Entitlements""  . . . . . .   and he named:      Social Security . . . .   Medicare  . . . .  Medicaid.     Those same stories also showed - Democrats confirmed they agree with the situation.      So   . . . . .   NEITHER party by their own admissions  is planning to save your benefits  as they are currently    . . . . .  but they do want to preserve their other spending and/or  tax cuts or both in other areas.    And they'll argue till they are blue in the face that ""their party"" is good and the other  is all wrong.   Talk about illogical - both agree problems exist & NEITHER have a single good solution between them.Elected Congress has continued to spend  more these last 12 years  and Federal deficits have gone up greatly since 2014  which  already had high deficits.   Yes,  the  current economy has improved - but new spending legislation and adding new categories of people to entitlement programs who NEVER DID contribute have been far greater than our larger economy can afford.  I won't debate the merits or partisan politics  of Congress's spending - but the facts are that Congress has NO POSITIVE answers .  .  .  . for the three most important programs  ===>   Social Security . . . .   Medicare  . . . .  Medicaid < ====   their  only ""answers  in Congress""  are to  cut  benefits & increase program fees for those specific 3 entitlement programs & those qualified for them.    I think that is bad planning and weak reasoning by Congress that harms our country and its current and future Seniors.   Why?  Well first off, every one of you reading this is either a Senior now - or will be in the future - we are all effected.Unlike  other so called  ""entitlements"" or giveaways = = = =>  Social Security,  Medicare,  and Medicaid  get most of their funding from  ALL  THE LEGAL workers  of past and present who have ALWAYS been  funding those 3 entitlements programs from their wages and earnings  and been doing that ALL THEIR WORKING LIVES.      Congress is not supposed to be providing benefits to either illegal immigrants who don't contribute or   those  who are refugees and haven't contributed.   And remember all the workers who have contributed for years and decades  . . . . also pay income taxes besides.   Social Security and Medicare entitle those who ""properly supported"" or ""properly qualified"" for inclusion in those insurance programs  to be the only ones  who should  - but Congress tinkered with those rules over and over and over again  too.  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid IS NOT a giveaway ""entitlement"" - its been paid for by most of those who receive it except where Congress added many others even though they didn't contribute.     Now don't do the Democrat and Republican ""thing"".        Excuses DO NOT fix the problems -         but real live solutions could and can correct some of the problems                                                & our husband & wife team have some solutions if you'll read along.My wife & I  started in 2001 - to design, invent, & innovate at levels beyond what most  would expect ""a regular citizen couple"" could or would do.    Congress is ""addicted"" to spending and promising money to voters.   It appears we need citizens to motivate ""treatment"" for those addictions of spending.    Congress wants  to  benefit cuts and increased fees - instead of finding good answers.    A nation of regular people like you & I have been paying toward  those promised  programs to fulfill what we've paid towards them our  whole lives.   But remember - if you aren't a senior now - you will be - its about everyone. ===>      If  you donate to our effort  . . .  its for your benefit or your family & friends benefit if you are to use these 3 programsin the future.    Our grandparents and great parents understood ""there is no free lunch"" - you have to work for it.  WE (my wife and I) have been working to benefit others - but its going to require others to help and support our significant efforts and to add to it to get Congress listening and discussing what they have not been able to do for decades. ===>            How is that possible ?   My wife & I have done what Government has not . . . .  imagining real solutions - then testing to prove them valid & reasonable.    We've been  inventing,   innovating  and testing ways to reduce the costs or  REDUCING the need for services  . . . . .  rather than looking at it from the negative side of reducing benefits or costing more.  Our theories are based on the idea of eliminating the needs for costs - rather than cutting the benefits that make the costs ===>  its a stunning difference in benefits.Here's an example of our country's history and our logic.    Invent what doesn't exist,  innovate to create what has not been thought of -  create what others don't imagine.      Thomas Edison,  Eli Whitney,  Benjamin Franklin,  Henry Ford and 1000's of others invented and innovated our country to successes both large and small.     So we used the exact same concepts.    Use new ideas and methods with common sense to reduce the frequency & expense of healthcare needed for Seniors.                 Each hip NOT broken could save  $100,000 or more to Medicare  . . . . .  imagine how many there are each year.                                        Each pneumonia not suffered  saves  untold hospital costs and nursing home stays.                                                        If Seniors avoid  causes of hospitalization & long nursing home stays, big chunks of money are not spent.    Meanwhile  if Seniors can avoid these problems and stay healthier they don't need to lose their benefits or pay more fees.     =====>    How simple can I say this?   If we can eliminate the need for many big expenses - we don't have the costs to pay.But it takes much more than wild ideas to accomplish this  - and  we've been working on those needed solutions - while politicians have talked for years about ""cutting and reducing"" the benefits as their ""solution"".   Let me be crystal clear . . . .  cutting benefits or paying more fees is not an answer . . . . .  it is merely a painful reaction to not having a solution.     Our effort of having real solutions - avoids the pain - and continues the benefits where needed.Why could a husband and wife team come up with positive solutions by the hand full while Congress over the same 18 years can't ?   Its a difference in motivations and not taking ""the easy road"" to get answers - its a lot more work and testing.   And its understanding normal people don't have the benefits that elected Federal officials are guaranteed.============> end of point number 1.2.   Improve safety and comfort for Seniors who choose to live in our ""proposed""  Assisted or Independent living design structures.  We believe Seniors whether you are 60 or 75 or 90 are not only a rapidly expanding quantity - but a GROWING IMPORTANCE in our country's future.    There are good and innovative ways to make Seniors lives safer and healthier and more pleasant for Seniors and not burden taxpayers at the same time.   But there is more - they have wisdom we are not harvesting.How can it be safer?    a.  Better material choices &  better design to protect against  ever MORE INCREASING yearly Tornadoes,  Storms & Wind damage,  not to mention better protection and safety  from Wild Fires,  or accidental fires and several forms of random crime.b.  Improved air quality,  heating & air conditioning  and breath ability.   As you age - these are big issues to consider.c.  Safer designs to help avoid falls, and reduce healthcare costs caused by  pneumonia,  broken bones,  lung  &  joint issues. d.  Unique NEW methods to help Seniors be more aware of their health  &  be pro-active rather than re-active in responding.      ""Checking the oil in a car"" is much cheaper than rebuilding or replacing ""a car engine that didn't have enough oil"" in it. d.  a focus on making seniors more valued and desired to  others in our country which also improves their mental & emotional perspective as well as helps the U.S. too.   When your body is exposed to a healthier more motivated mind & heart - your body responds as well.   Harvest Wisdom from Seniors just like a farmer properly treating his land gets better crop production too :-)Will people live longer if they are healthier?   We'd like to say Yes . .  but there are No guarantees . . .  but its safe to say they will likely be healthier in those same Senior years no matter how long those years are.    QUALITY of Life - not QUANTITY of years is OUR issue.                 What would I have given for the knowledge I have now - for my grandmother 40 years ago?                 She could have been healthier mentally the last 3 years of her life - and could have remained                              sharp till the end instead of worrying herself into a nursing home for those last 3 years.============> end of point number 2.When combining  goals and solutions for  #1 and #2 above -  you create healthier productive Seniors with less costs caused by hospitals,  surgeries,  medications & clinic visits;  if done correctly with the aid of our inventions & innovations    CUTS  in benefits & more FEES aren't needed because our ideas can reduce the spending on unneeded healthcare treatments.                                This is one of our dozen+  graphics -  this one targeted at the 2 stated above goals of our many solutions.Your government representatives aren't going to invent and innovate these ideas - but our husband and wife team DID.If you're going to be a Senior some day - our ideas help you.    If you have senior parents, friends, relatives etc.  it may help them.  Can these ideas extend a parent's life or happiness or both ?  Maybe.     I can accurately  tell you it did by 7 full years for my mom - because we've tested much of our innovations and ideas on her . . . .   and they worked for her and others.    My wife and I aren't   ""throwing darts at the target and hoping for a fluke bullseye""; from  2001 thru 2018 - we invented and then tested.Your donations keep us working on these goals and finalizing these inventions & innovations . . . .  and  finding ways to influence government as well as private enterprise to adapt our solutions.TWO  solutions - just 2 - from a list of more than a dozen+ solutions we have.   I'm highlighting  just 2 .   Is your donation worthwhile to help for just these 2 priorities ??   Who among you could say No - when YES is the logical answer.Don't even think about the other  12+ solutions not highlighted  here.      :-)Donate . . . . for choices  Congress members are not even considering possible.    They can't  ""imagine"" reducing costs - only reducing benefits or increasing fees.    That is opposite our country's founding and earlier history of  inventors and Innovators to be focused on THE POSITIVE - not the negative.    Why don't we (my wife and I)  contact Government about this.    We DID - starting with Congress and the Executive branch in 2011 and going forward . . .   1000's & 1000's of emails and MANY hundreds of mailings.   NONE of them since then has had a clue of the possibilities and only contacted us - with boiler plate  ""thank you"" letters or an occasional Governor or two interests.We need financial support - we need people support to get a positive and needed citizen impact for current and future Seniors.Congress wants to mess with your Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits - Its up to the citizens (you)  to keep us working because  government . . . . . needs to see and hear something other than their negative answers.Knowledgeable people tell me my wife & I  are offering                         too much proof - too much information - too many solutions.                        _________________     ________________________    ______________________I think that is nuts in a country badly lacking  solutions & answers to many needs.When we benefit Seniors properly  . . . . we benefit the country for everyone especially our youngest generations.===>  The graphic below is our entire plan of solutions woven into a single plan.   Above I talked of only those 2 solutions but the graphic below shows that we INDEED have a large and considerable number of solutions to eventually offer.                   Don't look at it or get distracted with ""too many solutions"".                                         REAL creativity - not just colorful words and  old, tired, worn efforts to be heard only at election time. I'd challenge you to name a single solitary proposed candidate for President in any party - offering ideas like ours.I challenge you to name 2 Senators or Representatives offering this level and quality of solutions to our entitlement issues.The graphic below is focused on ideas . . . . .  then the testing of the ideas . . . .  then experience inventing what is needed.

I have been born and raised as a full blown republican loving American my whole life. My parents have taken me to all the Trump rally’s and Glenn Beck conventions so needless to say I will vote red this next election and the ones to follow but I don’t have to so I ask what is my vote worth for the next four presidential elections and any other major elections in that time? If the donations are good enough and hit the goals I will no longer vote red and will vote blue if the first 2000 is met I will vote blue in 2020 for the leading candidate and blue for any of the following major elections that coincides with 2020 and if the donations reach 1000$ over that I will continue to vote that way for the next 4 presidential and major elections to followIf the donations are met I will prove it by creating a FB page to show I did what I said I would and will give the link to all that donated. Now if that target is not met by election time any money raised will be returned and I will continue to vote as I always have. So I ask how important is 2020 to you. Also if the target is met a year before the 2020 election time I will also campaign for the leading democrat of the donators choice that will be displayed on that FB page. So the decision is yours.  P.s.

Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform.[3][19] Well into the 20th century, the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings; following the New Deal, however, the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities.[20][21][22] After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the core bases of the two parties shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s. White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s. People living in urban areas, women, college graduates, sexual and gender minorities, millennials, and black, Latino, Jewish, and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party.[23][24][25]The Democratic Party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state.[26] It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy.[27] Policies such as environmental protection, support for organized labor and labor unions, the introduction of social programs, affordable college tuition, universal health care, equal opportunity, and consumer protection form the core of the party's economic policy.[26][28] On social issues, it advocates campaign finance reform,[29] LGBT rights,[30] police and immigration reform,[31] stricter gun laws,[32] and the legalization of marijuana.[33]There have been 15 Democrats who have served as president of the United States. The first was Andrew Jackson, who was the seventh president and served from 1829 to 1837. The most recent was Barack Obama, who was the 44th and held office from 2009 to 2017. As of 2019, the Democrats hold a majority in the House of Representatives, 14 state government trifectas (governorship and both legislative chambers),[34] the mayoralty of numerous major American cities,[35] and 18 total state legislatures. Four of the nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court had been appointed by Democratic presidents."

It’s a lovely house, and we rent our home from Mike and Pauline Lock, who live immediately adjacent to us.Mike Lock is a recent former Mayor of Yeovil and current Liberal Democrat councillor.Pauline Lock is current Deputy Mayor of Yeovil and current Liberal Democrat councillor.They are well known local characters. They are people of much wealth and this has shown in the tens of thousands of pounds of legal costs which they are allegedly using to harass and intimidate us.I am a contractor software engineer and we moved to Yeovil for a contract with BAE Systems.We do not own our home, instead choosing to benefit from our relative mobility, by having a young family and moving the family with each contract. As my contracts are normally of the 1 or 2 year duration, and the kids are still young, this has worked quite well until recently.We have been through a long and drawn out civil legal battle with the landlords involving allegations of invasion of privacy, breaking into our home with violence, threats to kill, bullying and harassment, both around our home and at my workplace.This whole thing started because when we moved into the rented property the we were shocked to discover the landlords have a remotely viewed CCTV camera outside our bath room.The Landlords refused to remove it, so we engaged a professional to disconnect it (without damage). Then the trouble started.Having been dragged through all this for almost a year by the Landlords, I have lost my work contract and livelihood.We are now living on the breadline due to the landlords conduct and are faced with constant frivolous and abusive legal proceedings. I am looking for work, but nothing has materialised as yet. I remain hopeful, but at the moment we are fire fighting.We recently received judgement. Please seehttps://aljanabifamily.wordpress.com/We have placed a download link to the civil judgment here. There will be more documents and evidence to come, once we get confirmation from the court that we can publish.As the judgement is long, we would wish to be able extract out relevant quotes from the judgement, to help with consumption of the facts, however we refrain from doing so, as we fear being dragged back into frivolous legal proceedings and claims (Libel) by the Landlords, and therefore we attach only the full court findings.We are not Libel solicitors, and also to protect us from further frivolous legal proceedings, we do not feel safe publishing our court evidence, despite our desire to provide the public with this information also.It may be that this information can be gotten by any member of public, but we have not tested that theory yet. We intend to request this, and if it is the case that we can, we will subsequently publish any and all available additional information on this site.Therefore, it is our hope, to rely on the public to read the judgement, and come to conclusions about the people who represent them, entirely independently from us.This site contains only public documents, and represents a record of our story. For the avoidance of doubt, anything stated on this site, other than public documents, are our opinion only.This information has been published here in order to serve the public interest. Please share this site with all you know. We believe people have the right to know about the people who represent them in the community.I am looking for work, but we are stuck in this property, subject to the landlords constant alleged abuse of the legal process to further harass and intimidate us. We cannot afford solicitors and there is no government legal aid for this case.In addition to defending ourselves, we allege that the landlord has, on multiple occasions (Landlord going into my work place, putting a bag over our gas tank CCTV camera), breached an Injunction that we got from the court (for the Landlord to leave us alone). We fear the costs of taking them to court to get this justice.We hope to gather enough funds to minimally support ourselves whilst also engaging solicitors to fight back and defend ourselves against the constant barrage of frivolous legalities thrown at us, and are grateful and thankful for any support in order to enable us to survive and fight back until such time where I can find work and save enough to escape this nightmare.Thank you.We can be contacted at laythea@hotmail.com"

This book is a toddler step in the right direction. Its simplicity is also necessary for those who suffer from TDS to help them take baby steps towards loving President Trump and loving America. TDS aka Trump Derangement Syndrome is pretty close to being a diagnosable condition because of the way liberals react to anything that has Trump's name on it. (In fact, I expect their reaction to this book to begin in 3, 2, 1...freak out!!! And please burst into flames while you're at it!!!) The sheer lunacy of the Left at the mention of Trump's name, their infantile shrieking and recoiling is the reason for this book. I need your support to independently publish the book and to get it to every PATRIOT's home in time for Christmas.  Do you have relatives who suffer from TDS, order your copy on Amazon and send it to them? Are your neighbors Trump-haters? Put a copy of the book in their mailbox.

'invitation'... to help stop this nonsense in Washington D.C..Let me explain... The September 11th Attacks... put America on a disastrous, hyper-divisive track. It's time to UNITE and change that fact. For 18 years America has fought a war on terror overseas... that has turned into a full blown fight for The American Soul here at home. Over there... we win just about every battle. But when we look at America today... it's impossible to ignore the UGLY truth that we are clearly...LOSING... THE WAR... NONE OF US CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.AMERICA IS AT HER BEST... when average Americans step forward and say enough is enough--- consequences be damned... NOT ON MY WATCH!SO... Today I present to you... THE HOLY GRAIL... a Strategic Plan that will allow America to finally fight and... WIN... The War of Ideas that began on 9.11.America the new venture that I am asking you to help launch today is...'STRATEGIC EQUALITY'... THE 300 MILLION AMERICAN... NONVIOLENCE SOLUTION TO TERRORISM & MASS KILLINGS & THE OPIOID CRISIS & INCOME INEQUALITY & RACIAL HATE.America needs to be 'fixed'... unfortunately we can no longer fix what needs to be fixed in America... because darkness, division & hate have sickened our political process and created a true existential crisis in our nation's capital.18 years ago I began working on The Nonviolent Solution to Muslim Extremism. And my work on that idea kept leading me back to this one idea--- ALL OF AMERICA'S DARKEST PROBLEMS... Tens and Tens of Thousands of Drug Overdose Deaths, The Increase in School Shootings & All The Other Horrific Mass Killings, The Rise of Hate in America and So Much More... were a direct result of America's Failure to fight and win THE WAR OF IDEAS that began on 9.11.So... I literally gave all that I had to give in order to create a ""WAY"" for America to finally fight and win the war of ideas... and the more work I did on this Inspired idea... the more clear it became to me that what America desperately needed was a true alternative to... DARKNESS, DIVISION & HATE.FREICE MEDIA (the new venture I need your help getting off the ground)... IS... NOW... AMERICA'S ALTERNATIVE TO DARKNESS, DIVISION & HATE!!!TODAY... my development work on the alternative to Darkness, Division & Hate is finally complete and I'm ready to launch a new venture that will provide PATRIOTIC Americans the opportunity to UNITE against The Forces of Darkness, Division & Hate... BUT... I cannot launch this new venture without your help.By now it should be clear to everyone that AMERICA can no longer fix what needs to be fixed with an election... BECAUSE... OUR REPUBLIC IS SICK.America is so sick OUR POLITICS spits out one dark leader after another and because of that all we get from our political elections is more darkness, division & hate.AMERICA NEEDS A PARADIGM SHIFT. THIS NEW VENTURE THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO HELP FUND IS A... MASSIVE... PARADIGM SHIFT... that asks all Americans to unite for the purpose of helping to save The American Dream.More:  https://www.gofundme.com/f/UniteAmericaUniteWhat is The American Dream? It's this...""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — ""In other words... THE AMERICAN DREAM... IS... BELIEF IN EQUALITY FOR... ALL!Why... 'Help Save The American Dream'?BECAUSE... IF... 300 MILLION AMERICANS UNITE TO HELP SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM... AMERICA WILL WIN THE WAR OF IDEAS THAT BEGAN ON 9.11.FREICE MEDIA will serve 5 primary purposes:1. HELP SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.2. PROVIDE AMERICA WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL SOLUTION TO DARKNESS, DIVISION & HATE.3. HELP FIX AMERICA'S POLITICAL CRISIS.4. FIGHT AND WIN THE WAR OF IDEAS THAT BEGAN ON 9.11.5. UNITE 300 MILLION AMERICANS BEHIND A COMMON SENSE OF PURPOSE.TheDreamFeeder.com... IS COMING SOON.The primary business proposition of this new venture will become... TheDreamFeeder.com.'The Dream Feeder'... will become the single most important venture in the world... because it will facilitate a MASSIVE transfer of knowledge to all corners of the world... and help solve the problems of Income Inequality, Mass Migration and The Out of Control Cost of Higher Education.ALSO COMING SOON: The 174 Billion Dollar Entrepreneurial Fund or 'E-Fund' ...In every city, state and town in America... all Americans Wishing to pursue their American Dream will begin with a visit to their local Library and witness its transformation into a Community Entrepreneurial Support Center.The Entrepreneurial Spirit has always been the cornerstone of our Nation's advancement and economy.Throughout our history, the government has taken a very active and supportive role in commercial enterprises. Now it is time for the government to remove the special interest stranglehold on business development and establish a direct function to widen the average American's access to the benefits of the entrepreneurial umbrella.We must end the practice of campaign contributions influencing which ventures or industries will receive taxpayer dollars.The E-Fund will invest taxpayer money at the individual level, based on thoroughness and viability of a business undertaking without regard for political connections and donations.By making it possible… more will try. And We need more to try!The Objective is Simple… design institutional infrastructure aimed at demystifying and energizing the entrepreneurial process for those American Citizens with ideas and courage but without the historical experience, family/political connections or seed money to turn their thoughts into tangible value.Every successful enterprise has common components which lead to success.We will use social networking technology and a shared National Purpose to ensure the circulation of resources, experience and ideas for the greatest good of... The Many.The Entrepreneurial Support Centers and E-Fund will make individual skill training and development a primary intention.The Centers will also provide start-up expertise, seed capital investment and large scale coordination of federal, state and local resources while building a bridge to existing small and large business entities.The intent of the Entrepreneurial Support Center is to provide idea incubation until the holder(s) of the idea invest enough ""sweat equity"" to create value which permits the proposition to stand on its own.Once a sustainable business model is established, banks and other traditional funding mechanisms will take over.Remember this... ""If We build it... Congress MUST fund it!""Why attempt to raise 50 million dollars on GoFundMe?Well, when you see for yourself all that it will take to 'Help Save The American Dream'... you will see that it will take a great deal more than 50 million dollars. But not long ago a group of Americans raised more than 20 million dollars to build a wall... so I chose a number greater than that... to begin a conversation about what it truly means to be a PATRIOTIC American.What will it really take to Save The American Dream?The short answer is we need a 'Philosophical Solution' that... STOPS... the spread of darkness, division & hate. And we need a Strategic Plan that gives ALL Americans a different choice... a choice to pick a team that doesn't feed The Forces of Darkness, Division & Hate.It's a really long story and it took me more than 18 years to create...

I am a proud father of one and I am also proud of my niece. Who both are 8 years old.  As soon as they were born I have been very motivated to stay away from anything detrimentaI to my life to be a positive male role model in their lives as they grow into mature adults. Especially, since my niece's father passed away from living a street life that only has two avenues... death or prison. I want to show my niece that she can count on me and support her through life as she gets older. I want to help raise her and be someone she and my son can trust & count on.I struggled to find an occupation I actually love to do. I have been a survey technician since 2013. A close friend of mine got me into this field and I cannot get enough of it.  The work is very enjoyable. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about some (not all) of my coworkers. We all, inevitably, work with some people we do not like. Finally, finding something I like to do and during my 6 year run working as a survey technician I have experienced having some pretty prejudiced and sometimes racist coworkers here in Florida. Believe it or not there is a difference between being racist and being prejudiced. I have a problem with both but a racist is actually a person who has the power to stop you from progressing in life. A prejudiced person just hates and has no power. I am mixed with black and white. Growing up, I always knew I had a black father and a white mother even though my biological father wasn't around.Due to this racially charged atmosphere because of politics constantly being in our faces with our cell phones. People cannot seem to help themselves and talk about the forbidden topics during working hours. Which is race, sexual orientation, politics, religion, etc.  It has happened numerous times while I was working but I did not have the knowledge of how to do anything about until 2018.In 2018 I heard somethings that were blatantly prejudiced but I was put between a rock and a hard place because I had to defend myself from coworkers that were bigoted, had a sargent & cadet style of speaking to me and others prior to hearing racist jokes during working hours. I have a spine and I am the type that will defend. I don't believe in attacking anybody verbally or physically unless I am attacked first. We all occasionally do not see eye to eye with coworkers. It's inevitable for everyone. Prior to me hearing racist jokes and slurs I defended myself from other bigoted coworkers and I felt like I was on thin ice before being told to work with the President of the company's son.I didn't see eye to eye with the President's son and was told that I could lose my job if there were further misunderstandings. After that, I was on my best behavior and rarely spoke to anyone at this particular job. After I was verbally warned that I could lose my job the president's son and another coworker of mine would purposely say racist jokes and slurs in a passive  aggressive manner around me. Knowing that I was on thin ice and couldn't defend myself because they knew I was mislabeled as ""a problem"" at this company and could easily distort the truth to their benefit.I wasn't falling for their tricks. I simply wrote their jokes and slurs down and looked for another job. Took me a while but I landed an interview with another survey company. The reason I didn't immediately report their racist jokes and slurs is because I had suspicions that no one would care or do anything about my eventual complaints. I even tried to record them saying racist jokes with my phone but you can only imagine how difficult it is to read their minds and know when exactly to put my phone to record to actually get something racist recorded. As I was trying to get a recording I didn't know it was illegal to record people unbeknownst to them but my suspicions of no one caring because the President's son and another coworker who are, somehow, related are the ones saying these racist jokes. I felt strongly that no one would care or do anything and I was proven CORRECT when I finally complained to the HR manager.After getting an interview with another company I finally had the courage to complain about my racist coworkers. My suspicions of no one caring and proper discipline being handed down to my coworkers was proven right when the HR manager tried to defend the President's son and another coworker. She told me infuriating things like she's known them for years and doesn't believe that they would say anything racist, boys will be boys and if they didn't call me the n-word that I shouldn't be offended. I immediately wanted to hire a lawyer and sue this company but it doesn't work like that. You can sue someone for anything but in order to sue an employer you need permission from a federal agency like the EEOC. After sharing the outstanding evidence of text messages, emails and screenshots of phone calls signifying that I did complain about their racist jokes and slurs I was granted the right to sue letter after months of waiting. I paid a retainer fee for a few thousand dollars, successfully hired a lawyer and gave him $400 to file a lawsuit. Initially, my lawyer was super optimistic about working for me but after finally meeting him face to face he tried to convince to me settle for $50,000 for a quick pay day. He also said somethings that made me uneasy. He said I might not get a fair trial by jury and that he's not democrat or liberal AND that he's nervous about court. Which made me think that he doesn't want to do his due diligence and make sure I get fair compensation. He tells me all this after taking my money. Depositions are next up in my case and pretrial is all the way in December of 2020. There's no reason to be nervous about something that's so far away and I'm the victim. I refuse to let this man manipulate me into being nervous and settling for less than what me and my family deserve. I hope my lawyer doesn't go into the depositions and ask everyone what their favorite icecream is. I got a feeling I hired a skunk lawyer and I'm just asking for money just in case I need more money to hire another lawyer to sue my current lawyer for possible malpractice and properly take over my legitimate case against my former employer. $10,000 is what I'm asking for to make sure I am not simply too poor to defend myself from skunk lawyers and a racist company who fired me for reasons I cannot help. I cannot help that I was born black. I am living a legal life out of the streets and setting a positive example for my niece and son. I have lost faith in this world but after reading some of these tear jerking stories on this website and how much people are giving to people in unfortunate circumstances. My faith is restored and I am humbley asking for help. The only thing I want to accomplish with the $10,000 is to make sure I am not too poor to defend myself from crooked, bigoted, unreasonable people and pay for therapy because what I experienced effected my ability to trust people. I will gladly want to give back whatever money I do not use.It was very difficult for me to do the right thing in that stressful situation because I grew up with violence in my life. During my adolescence I solved problems by getting physical with people. The kids that are in my life have showed me that I cannot put my hands on people to solve my problems because I will not be here to provide and care for them if I physically fought everyone who makes me angry. Please donate to make sure I will get a fair trial and will not lose this case because I'm simply too poor to hire a better lawyer. Thank you from a dedicated father and uncle."

This means that I can only work for someone else for so long before I believe I can do it better. That usually comes after I calculate the business model and realize the percent of the profits I am receiving. The problem is that I do not come from affluence. The opposite really. No financial educators were readily available in my life. My grandparents did whatever they could to give me and my siblings a solid upbringing including mortgaging our future to send us through private schools. They passed away when I was fourteen (before finances meant anything to me). This left my mother to raise the three of us by herself, on a salary of a preschool teacher, as my dad was off trying to get help with his drug addiction. That didn't work out for him or us. I am looking for a leg up.

GOD knows when these events are going to happen. Furthermore, the only instruction from GOD are in the WORD OF GOD, how Christian should act in the “End of Days” witness that JESUS is GOD and He Died on the cross for the sins of those who receive Him as their savior. Before I begin, I need to take a moment and apologize for my writing, it is not my strong suit and growing up my parents really did not see any purpose for me to get an education. The WORD OF GOD states we should not be ignorant and watch for HIS return. There is a deadline date for these Biblical events.1 THESSALONIANS 54 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.1TH-5:4[52-1116-29626]16V 77CH 1500BK 754093HWIn these End Times the fulfillment of Bible prophecy will have the greatest impact upon man then any event since the creation of Adam. No war that man has fought nor nature disaster that have caused the death of millions will compare to the book of Revelation prophecy as well as those in the Old Testament. Most who have gone to Sunday school have forgotten the prophecies in the Bible but GOD has not and will accomplish it to the last details. Example, in the case of Egypt which the verse below refers to, will allow Israel to stop guarding the border between Egypt and Israel. Most believe that this is from nuclear war but even in a nuclear war man can put on radiation suits and walk around, look at what Russia did in Chernobyl. So, it is not nuclear it is THE WORD OF GOD that states no one will pass through it. HE even includes animals which means life will die on the borders of Egypt as well as in Egypt. This contradicts all those who say “GOD is only love” what they never read the Bible and what GOD thinks of Egypt, a type of the world. Most have seen the movie The Ten Commandments. You somehow forgot the wrath that GOD brought on Egypt, and HE is not done with them, for forty years the wrath of GOD will rest on Egypt that should make property values drop in Egypt and make Egypt invade Iran for their survival. Talk about a movement of war when the whole population of one country invading another country for their life.EZEKIEL 29 11 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.EZE-29:11[26-0831-21195]23V 356CH 21916BK 549868HWIn this book I hope to show you why there is a deadline for Biblical prophecy and will tackle some of the most difficult verses in the Bible as well as show you how you need to understand time in order to prepare for the future. A good example is:2 PETER 38 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.2PE-3:8[61-1159-30531]27V 193CH 1262BK 773627HWFrom this verse we can calculate how much time pass on earth when there is about a half hour of silence in heaven 1,000years/1,440 minutes equal .694 times 30 minutes equals 20 years 10 months. In case you are wondering why I selected 30 minutes Read. It can also be said that a day is approximately 1,136 minutes.Revelations 8 1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.REV-8:1[66-1175-30829]20V 20CH 3886BK 781521HWNow I’m not saying this will happens but like in chess a good player calculates every move the opponent can move his or her pieces in order to defend and attack. Knowing everything in the Bible that can happen during tribulation can only benefit those who are going to go through tribulation and not those who are going up in the resurrection in the Body of Christ. That being said there will be some that will try to make a buck out of what I’m writing about, GOD did not show them the message but they will try to hijack the message that GOD gave me. They will omit the part that they are offended by. That is why this message is for Bible Believers and not Bible perverters in any age.When all life on earth knows that everything is going to change and not for the better, they will make choices that can have a permanent impact on their life. Forever is at stake and they will need to know what to do, to please GOD. Knowing the ordered of what is going to happen as well as the season of when it could happen, will be the only reason for them to get through the day. A small chance is still a chance.In the United States of America, democracy is the rule of law without any reference to THE WORD OF GOD. Tell the elected official that they are fired and from this point forward the United States is going to be a Dictatorship and the ONE in charge is THE WORD OF GOD and therefore we no longer need any elected official until JESUS CHRIST shows up and sits on his throne in Israel. We will do what is written in THE WORD OF GOD on every social issue. The American public will revolt they will state it is illegal to do what is written in THE WORD OF GOD and if you go down this road, we will lock you up and you may face the death penalty. You cannot even call someone an Antichrist because that is a threat. The same way a man eating a steak dinner and calling himself a vegan is the same way people voting to elect liberal democrats into office and calling themselves Christian. As a Christian your views on social issues comes from the Bible. THE KING JAMES 1611 AV WORD OF GOD and not from some liberal democrat who want nothing more than to bring more sin on your eternal soul and destruction on the U.S... Why do you think Hollywood is making movies and T.V. shows about purging the U.S. of undesirables? Remember it can go both ways the Bible Believing Christians can remove from the population those that obey not THE WORD GOD either by deportation or by some other means. Or the public can remove Christians who are being a thorn and threat to this sinful worldly government by peaching and voting Christian into office. After the rapture everyone should start supporting Jesus Christ as the world Dictator and doing what THE WORD OF GOD states. However, everyone knows that is not going to happen. They want their freedom at any cost and the prospect of them not being able to vote on who is in charge does not make any sense to them. In the US all the social issues come from New York city media corporations and Las Angles T.V. and movies. They would never give their authority to those who would call for them to be stone to death on day one after the rapture. Furthermore, the bureaucrats who protect the wicked would never let THE WORD OF GOD be established as the Law of the land. The good news is that America is done with, all you have to do is some basic math. In the following pages I hope to show you how living in the United States will bring nothing but death for the majority of the population after the rapture, after all if you cannot walk to the middle east what good are you. China, India, Russia and many of the European county have invitation to Armageddon. So why would GOD kill them if he is going to kill them at Armageddon. The horseman takes 25% of the world population in the breaking of SEALS. People will be asking how can GOD kill the United States when they should be asking why did HE not do it sooner, we should have gotten Raptured up with everyone else. Read the Bible JESUS the Body of Christ was in the Israel, HE preached to them he died for them and they rejected the WORDS that Jesus spoke just like America rejected THE WORD OF GOD. The same generation that saw JEUSU CHRIST birth saw the Romans destroy Jerusalem. Why do you think he said don’ weep for me? One generation is all it took. The downfall of America was established when the founding fathers refused to established THE WORD GOD in the constitution. Which at the time would have been easy but they were afraid of the Inquisition and loved money? That they, as slave owners, were receiving from slaves. When you read the rules for slaves in the Bible, you would never own one. That is why GOD did what HE did, HE made rules that would make owning anyone not worth the cost. So, in one generation is all it took from the slaughter of children in Bethlehem to the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem.LUKE 2328 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.LUK-23:28[42-0996-25964]21V 560CH 24327BK 672425HWAmerica had every chance to get right but it gets worse and worse. The corruption of the Word of GOD started in the U.S... Preacher had the best weapon against social liberal democratic agenda all they had to say is “WHAT DOES THE WORD OF GOD SAY? And do it” and that is the end of the matter. But now people have taken the positions, if you change the Bible to prove your own personal religious doctrine then you can change it to accept liberal democratic social issues. What is amazing is that those same Bible corruptors sat in a class usually called Theology. In this class they were taught all the special words that are used to describe GOD like “Omnipotent”. The WORD OF GOD also another name for JESUS CHRIST, never had any of these special words attached to it. Because it would be harder to attack THE WORD OF GOD when you attach these words to the Bible. Let me explain GOD exist in every moment of time at the same time, every time and all the time. At this moment GOD is talking to Adam before the fall and after, talking Moses face to face, the LORD GOD JESUS CHRIST is preaching on the Mount, dying on the cross, burning in hell for the sins of the world. As I spoken for many years it is that moment of faith that’s last forever because GOD exist in every moment of time at the same time, every time and exist outside of time, FOREVER. That is probably why the devil thought he was not going to die on the cross and go into hell, who would want to add that moment to THEIR existence a moment that will last forever when You exist at the same time all the time. THE WORD OF GOD is at the GREAT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT being used to judge creatures the same word is being written on Sinai mount. The King James 1611 AV Bible also exist in every moment of time at the same time all the time. Every part, all 66 books, 1189 chapters, 31102 verses and 789,630 words (I counted them) 667 hyphens are from GOD. Take for example there is 23,145 verses in the Old Testament divide that by four seasons you get 5,786.25 years. It is currently 5,780 in the Jewish year. When you believe GOD controls everything then blessing from GOD can be seen with clear eyes. Another example look at the chart below, Abraham was born 1948 years after Adam. Israel became a nation in the year 1948. From the Bible he went into the promise land “Israel” when he was 75 years old or 2023 or approximately 5783.25 (Mal 3:12). This is also why I’m not setting any dates all I will be stating is that in the near future there will be a deadline and some events will happen before that deadline to make the Jewish nation gather again to the State of Israel. In the modern world he used the stick first (the Holocaust) then the carrot, JESUS CHRIST in the air. Furthermore, the Jewish people using the New testament. The Jewish people will see that the sin that they did was not crucifying CHRIST but rejecting the GOSPEL. That is what made GOD turn to the Gentle nations and destroy Israel. GOD has now turned back to Israel even though Israel has not turned whole heartily towards GOD. If they had the Dome of the Rock would be gone and the Jewish Temple would be in the middle of being built. The Jewish nation has not even declared the Word of God as the governing Document of the Jewish people. Why do you think GOD has called Jerusalem? Sodom in the book of Revelation 11:8. That’s the present and future of Jerusalem, why does the Jewish people have no faith in these last days?Revelation 118 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.REV-11:8[66-1178-30881]26V 230CH 5438BK 783073HWName Created Age at birth Year lived after birth Age at death Time of death Bible verse Name meansAdam 0 130 800 930 930 Gen 5:1 Take out of earthSeth 130 105 807 912 1042 Gen 5:3 compensationEnos 235 90 815 905 1140 Gen 5:6 Man is his frailtyCainan 325 70 840 910 1235 Gen 5:9 AcquisitionMahalaleel 395 65 830 895 1290 Gen 5:12 The praise of GODJared 460 162 800 962 1422 Gen 5:18 He that descendsEnoch 622 65 300 365 987 Gen 5:21 Teacher no deathMethuselah 687 187 782 969 1656 Gen 5:25 It shall be sentLamech 874 182 595 777 1651 Gen 5:28 OverthrowerNoah 1056 500 450 950 2006 Gen 5:32,7:6 RestShem 1556 102 400 500 2158 Gen 11:11 RenownArphaxed 1658 35 403 438 2096 Gen 11:13 One that ReleasesSalah 1693 30 403 433 2126 Gen 11:15 Eder 1723 34 430 464 2187 Gen 11:17 A flockPeleg 1757 30 209 239 1996 Gen 11:19 DivisionReu 1787 32 207 239 2026 Gen 11:21 FriendSerug 1819 30 200 230 2049 Gen 11:23 Shoot BranchNahor 1849 29 119 148 1997 Gen 11:25 Breathing SlayerTerah 1878 70 135 205 2083 Gen 11:32 Wild goat TurningAbraham 1948 100 75 175 2123 Gen 25:7 The Father of multitudeIssaac 2048 60 120 180 2228 Gen 35:28 He LaughJacob 2108 77 70 147 2255 Gen 47:28 He strives with GODGenesis 124 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.GEN-12:4[01-0012-303]29V 109CH 6877BK 6877HWNow there are past events where the dates are up in the air, no one knows for sure when it happened only that it did happen and doing a web search will give you approximately the time of when these events occurred. By most the destruction of the Jewish temple happened between 601 B.C. and 586 B.C. another event, when was the Dome of the Rock Built. Doing a web search again and you will find the Dome of the Rock was built between 686 A.D. to 691 A.D. So, know we need to bring this information and what the Bible says and see how the future will unfold. The days in the Bible can mean days, years and even both at the same time. Daniel 1211 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.12 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.DAN-12:11[27-0862-22093]30V 370CH 11561BK 578914HWDAN-12:12[27-0862-22094]17V 387CH 11578BK 578931HW1,290 days we can take as years and days. So, from the year 599 B.C. to 691 A.D you get One thousand and ninety days from 691A.D. to 2026 or 5786.25 you get One thousand three hundred and thirty-five day or years. Why is that so important to understand because the Jewish people and Muslim have some common belief. That is the worshipping of Idols, eating pork, don’t do either. From the verse below we can see GOD’s hand in it.Isaiah 664 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.ISA-66:4[23-0745-18927]42V 174CH 36399BK 481250HWIf the Muslim refuse to worship the image of the antichrist then they will be killed, the same goes for the Jews however the Jews have several protectors. Whereas the Muslim do not. Their existence has been to persecute all who are not Muslim. Now the world, Devil, antichrist and false prophet will persecute them. All those old saying will be used against them “dam if you do and dam if you don’t”, “he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword”, “A message of death for all those who read the message of death, the Coran”. It is amazing that the Muslim world has been trying to punish all infidels in the U.S. and now the only ones that can help them would be the U.S., or what is left of the U.S. infidels during tribulation. Many claim Muslims claimed to be the children of Abraham. Genesis 2740 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.GEN-27:40[01-0027-768]34V 1073CH 18828BK 18828HWThat Dome of the Rock could be the biggest mistake they ever made. That rock would be the perfect place to sacrifice all those who do not worship the image of the antichrist. How many Muslims can be killed in One thousand two hundred and ninety days on one rock? The Arabic people saw how GOD dealt with the Jew and decided to make a religion that mirrors it. The problem was they took it from the Old Testament ignoring the prophecies. The fulfilment of prophecies is what makes everything tie together. This is a saying I came up with to explain He gave the Jews the letter of the law, He gave the gentle THE WORD OF GOD, and after us He will give the meaning of life. Letter, Word, Meaning. The meaning can be found in THE WORD OF GOD.Revelation 411 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.REV-4:11[66-1171-30780]27V 348CH 2400BK 780035HWWe are here to please GOD!!!!!!!We start by receiving JESUS CHRIST as GOD.The acknowledge we are sinners going into eternal damnation. Then we accept JESUS CHRIST as GOD dyeing on the Cross for our sins.Furthermore, HE rose from the dead and is on the right hand of GOD As I previous mention I will be going through some of the most difficult verses in the Bible. The Odds of these verses being written at different times and by different authors cannot be calculated. I hope this will help you during the end of days. For the Muslims in the middle east they will either bow and worship the image which would make them bad Muslims and worthy of death by their own belief. Or not worship the image of the beast and be killed by the Devil, antichrist or false prophet. Brother slaying bother or brother death by the devil. An important matter to bring up. In math man has come up with the symbol infinity ∞ it describes a mathematical constant of an unending amount of FOREVER. Infinity minus 1 equals infinity minus 2 or infinity plus 7. Using that same concept compared to GOD all creatures are the same value. Compared to GOD the devil, man and an ant are equal. GOD can disrupt the mind of a devil just as easy as disrupting the mind of an ant. Moreover, GOD can disrupt all creatures just as easy a disrupting one creature. The WORD OF GOD can be easily read by a child. However, a noble prize-winning medical doctor won’t be able to understand THE WORD OF GOD if his of her life depends on it. It is so important to have faith in the all-powerful, all-knowing GOD.When I talk about time, people usually don’t understand how GOD can exist outside of time. The we use Einstein theory about a blackhole where the mass is so great the light cannot escape it and it warps time. So, then the question to ask, how much does GOD weigh? He has the mass of INFINTY without end. This where time stops when a creature is with HIM (THE CREATOR) the creature will experience time. The creature can enter where GOD is, be judge have a very long conversation with GOD, and the exit to the same moment of time the he left. Having a good personal relations ship with GOD is the most important task there is in a creature’s life because it is forever. Read and study your BIBLE, pray without stopping, instead of thinking to yourself, think to GOD, ask HIM to remind you of thing that need to get done.Which bring me to asking, look at what Joshua ask for and after reading how do you know what day it currently is, after all that was one long day, it was literally the day the “earth stood still.” Joshua 1012 ¶ Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.JOS-10:12[06-0197-6077]43V 428CH 7444BK 164181HWJOS-10:13[06-0197-6078]47V 475CH 7491BK 164228HWThe Jewish people did something along time age that cannot easily be explained. From Exodus 12:2 GOD told them this was the first month of the year Passover, but not anymore when you look at the Jewish calendar it is the feast of Rosh Hashana and not Passover.Exodus 122 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.EXO-12:2[02-0062-1819]21V 35CH 8011BK 46273HWLeviticus 235 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD'S passover.LEV-23:5[03-0113-3408]14V 102CH 19135BK 90083HWLeviticus 2324 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.LEV-23:24[03-0113-3427]32V 681CH 19714BK 90662HWIn the last part of September or first part of October is the first of the new year. This goes to the problem of setting dates for Biblical events what do you use for the New Year. In the past did the Jewish people state “this was a year so bad that we need to cut it short”. So, they celebrated Passover then came to Rosh Hashanah and said this will be the New Year. Which also mean in the future will the Jewish nation bring back the right New Year so the Jewish New Year would be back 14 days before Passover which would make that year approximately 17 months long. They would do this in order to follow THE WORD OF GOD or the United Nation would ask them to do it in order to push a Biblical event 5 months down the road. So now you would have 2026 5th month May for the new dead line. I need to state this again I’m going through every different possibility through THE WORD OF GOD. Year Begins Pass OverWednesday, March 25, 2020 Wednesday, April 8, 2020Saturday, March 13, 2021 Saturday, March 27, 2021Friday, April 1, 2022 Friday, April 15, 2022Wednesday, March 22, 2023 Wednesday, April 5, 2023Monday, April 8, 2024 Monday, April 22, 2024Saturday, March 29, 2025 Saturday, April 12, 2025Wednesday, March 18, 2026 Wednesday, April 1, 2026Wednesday, April 7, 2027 Wednesday, April 21, 2027So, Joshua did it for a day the Israel did it for a year. Just like in the book of Daniel 8:14 we don’t think about the major event that happen in the Old Testament. That would be the Flood, GOD destroyed everyone except for those on the Ark that Noah built Gen 7:13. That event would have been on everyone mind even past the life of Daniel. The other is how to tell time. How long does it take for the moon to be back in the same position as it started? Trust me I’m going somewhere with this. Daniel 814 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.DAN-8:14[27-0858-21976]18V 482CH 7679BK 575032HWNow take 2,300 days times 24 hours which equals 55,200. Now take the revolution of the moon which is 27.3217 times 55,200 hours which equals 1,508,157.84 days then divide that by 365.2422 number of days in a year. The total is 4,129.199 years add that to the year that the flood was over and Noah walked on dry ground 1657 and the total is 5686.199 in the Jewish year. In the verse the sanctuary can only mean where the Dome of the rock is or the Temple Mount. Now there has been a lot going on the temple mount from the flood to present. The question is, was everything that has happen or will happen covered under the term “cleansed”. I have and many others have assumed that “cleansed” only referred to the abomination that took place in the Old Testament. However, the “cleansed” could be accumulative covering everything that was and will be done on the Temple Mount. When considering what will take place during tribulation on the temple mount the “cleansed” can only mean everything past present and when JESUS CHRIST sits down and rules. Now in the time before JESUS CHRIST showed up the children of Israel was looking for HIM. The question is, what made them think Immanuel was going to be riding on an ass going through the Prince’s gate and setting up HIS Kingdom. Now in the previous paragraph I showed how Abraham was born 1948 years after the creation of Adam. Anybody reading the scriptures would take notices of how long GOD made Abraham wait for his true heir 100 years from his birth. That is a long time to wait by faith. GOD plan was to have everyone show up at the right time, JESUS CHRIST, John the Baptist and Judas the future antichrist. From Adam to Abraham 1,948 years from Abrahams birth to Isaac birth 100 years or 2048 years from Adam. From the birth of Isaac to the birth of CHRIST 1,948 years or 3,996 years from Adam. The Jews in the time right before CHRIST was doing the math. The 3,996 is what most scholars have as the birth year of CHRIST. Furthermore, John the Baptist was before CHRIST in order to prepare HIS was. Genesis 215 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.GEN-21:5[01-0021-519]15V 91CH 12493BK 12493HWMalachi 31 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.MAL-3:1[39-0928-23122]45V 45CH 1078BK 608545HWNow Judas birth date could also correspond with math 6 times 666 equals 3996. Those in the old testament did not have a clue about 666 it was not given until the book of Relations.Revelation 1318 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.REV-13:18[66-1180-30927]31V 538CH 6823BK 784458HWTo drive the point home this period of time has been marked as one of the most important times in past history. Man has never had so many important Biblical events done and by such few men and GOD. Again, forgive my writing. Before the New Testament was written and before JESUS CHRIST died on the cross the Jews could have accepted HIM as their savior. If they would have done this act of faith then JESUS CHRIST would have still died on the cross. All he had to do was go to the Roman army and state I AM the true King of Israel and not Cesar. They would have crucified HIM with the help of Judas. After he has risen, he would have sent the state of Israel into the world to proclaim the Gospel. When you look at the population of the world and that of Israel the Gospel could have been preached easy within 70 years. Furthermore, at that time everyone knew the story of Israel. GOD knew that Israel was going to reject the Gospel. The question is when did GOD accept their rejection of the Gospel. Remember there is man’s will and there is GOD’s will. These verses prove it. Daniel 417 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.25 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.DAN-4:17[27-0854-21855]53V 514CH 3595BK 570948HWDAN-4:25[27-0854-21863]65V 869CH 3950BK 571303HWSo how many years did GOD give Israel to repent. I believe it is possible to glean some information from the Bible where we can get a high number and a low number. Getting back to the Bible verse numbers there is a total of 7957 in the New Testament divide that by 4 seasons you get 1989.25 years this represents the Church age. Jesus was born in the Gentle calendar of 3996 plus approximately 33.5 years for the life He lives as THE CHRIST JESUS add all those years together you get 6,018.75 years minus 4000 years you 2,018.75 year. Then we can calculate the low number at the year at 29.75 (2,018.75-1,989.25) at the starting of the Gospel. Since it is 2019.75 as I’m writing. We know that it is longer than a year for GOD to count the Jews as rejecting CHRIST as their Jewish Savior. We or at least I can write the deadline for a Biblical event to happen is 5786.25 and I’m writing this it is 5780 we can calculate the high number of 6.25 years plus 29.75 is 36 years, 36 A.D. or forty years from HIS birth. or for the Bible lovers they would prefer 40 years from his birth. However, the start of the Church age and Israel rejection does not have to start at the same time. The same amount of time it took Moses to become one of the tribe “Levi” through the death of an Egyptian. The Jewish people rejected GOD in the Old Testament1 Samuel 8:7. They rejected CHRIST in the Gospels of the Apostles and finally rejected THE HOLY GHOST in Acts chapter 7 by the stoning to death of Stephen. A death can get you into the blessing and taken out of the blessing. Don’t kill Christians stop harassing Christians, and don’t call yourself a Christian and vote for a democrat. Yes, I have brought politics into the discussion because in these last days it will become politics and no longer religion. 1 Samuel 8 7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.1SA-8:7[09-0244-7377]38V 158CH 5027BK 202158HWJohn 1915 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.JOH-19:15[43-1016-26841]31V 352CH 16994BK 691031HWRomans 1125 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.ROM-11:25[45-1057-28235]39V 622CH 6700BK 724076HWI know that many don’t like me bring politics into the message but the trouble is that politics should have never been taken out of the message. Now we are saved through grace and faith not of works. However, after the rapture the works you will need to do is stand up to the government even at the cost of your life. Why the U.S. government got away with shutting the mouth of preachers though the tax law I can never understand. It seems like those who vote for a person to go into the U.S. government would stipulate that they change the tax law about religious speech towards the government. Pastors should be able to indorse and even do fund raising for anyone who runs for political office. Anyone who says differently is of the devil. When I was a child lawyers could not advertise their business now almost every time you turn on the T.V. you see an ad about an Attorney. If the supreme court can say that not letting Attorneys advertise go against free speech why not have the supreme court state that having pastors face losing their nonprofit status because they indorse a political candidate goes against free speech. Why someone hasn’t stood up and called out these GOD hating bureaucrats, I don’t know. Another nugget with in the text in the book of Daniel 12:7 7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.DAN-12:7[27-0862-22089]68V 271CH 11462BK 578815HWHow many has applied this verse to 1948 years. Take 3.5 times 1,948 you get 6,818 years minus 1,000 years of peace Revelation 20:3 and you get 5,818 years. Minus 5786.25 you get 31.75 years also minus the time for tribulation approximately 7.25 leaves 24.5 years the devil, that dam dragon gets a short season to bring about Gog and Magog or less time before he goes into the lake of fire depending on him doing the Will and Word of God for the pleasure of JESUS CHRIST.Revelation 20:8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.REV-20:8[66-1187-31047]37V 265CH 10461BK 788096HWIf wandering in the desert for forty years is a long season than 24.5 years would be a season or even a short season.Joshua 247 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.JOS-24:7[06-0211-6484]44V 232CH 18042BK 174779HWBefore anyone starts sending messages about the moment of silence that I previous wrote about in the book of Revelation 8:1 GOD can also extend the high numbers for the rejection JESUS CHRIST by the present world and the Jews out twenty years and ten months. Or HE can have no moment of silence that affects this world and only in heaven.Now if you ask anyone with an average I.Q., they would put off Eternal damnation for as long as they can. So, you can imagine that the devil, antichrist and false prophet would do anything to extend it out over twenty years after the seals are broken and the four horseman kills 25% of the world population. The Antichrist ( The Beast) and false prophet would even give all the gold in the U.S. to Israel as well as remove the Dome of the Rock and every Palestinian in Israel to change the start of the New Year by five months with any chance that GOD would grant the new start date.Now I will like to write about the cards that the devil can play in these last days. The first one is taken from the movies “Clash of the Titans”, “Wrath of the Titans” if you don’t believe in THE LORD GOD, HE can’t hurt you, that was the context of the movies. There is nothing you can do for GOD that HE can’t do for HIMSELF. You cannot weaken GOD by doing or not doing anything, HE is the same today, yesterday and forever. The other is from one of the devil’s favorite show “Star Trek” season 4 Episode 14 “Devil Due”. It took me less than 5 minutes to find and watch on the web. Here a planet is going through tribulation caused by an alien presence. On this world there was old manuscripts stating that the time of tribulation will come after 1,000 years. GOD is not some alien on a ship causing hardship on this present world. Read the past passages I have written. In first John 2:18 it states that there are many antichrists, in Matthew 24:24 it talks about who can be deceived. 1 John 218 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.1JO-2:18[62-1161-30569]31V 455CH 702BK 774620HWMathew 2424 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.MAT-24:24[40-0953-23982]28V 477CH 18714BK 627962HWTo deceive the very elect should not be easy but when you attack THE WORD OF GOD and change into whatever supports your personal belief is. We can see how easy it would be to deceive the elect. Leave the Bible alone don’t change anything. Also don’t add to IT. Now is the time for me to address an important issue, hyper thecal, if you use the word placement in the Bible and discover what the thunder was saying in Revelation 10:4 don’t add it to the Bible it is not your place to add anything to the Word of GOD. That is why I put those verse on the cover. There was a movie made where they invented a machine that could see into the future and man saw a nuclear war then after seeing it, they caused a nuclear war. So many have neglected the lessons of the WORD OF GOD in the Bible GOD appointed a man (King and people) to their death then a King spared their lives (1 Kings 20:42 read for yourselves). GOD has appointed some to their death so don’t write or advertise who is going to die and which cities. After writing all that I will make an exception this time on pure basic common sense.Revelation 104 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.REV-10:4[66-1177-30866]37V 121CH 4976BK 782611HWFirst, I know GOD is in the message I’m about to write about the United States of America and as long as I don’t give out possible dates from the word of GOD but give the reasons behind these places, I should be safe.In the garden of Eden there was a tree, knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:17) don’t eat or you will die that was the only commandment for life without end at that time. Genesis 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.GEN-3:6[01-0003-62]51V 179CH 1608BK 1608HWI John 2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.1JO-2:16[62-1161-30567]33V 404CH 651BK 774569HWIn this present world we have the equivalent. Good for food equals “lust of the flesh” equals New York city, there is so much on this. Look at how large amounts of food are bought on the New York Stock Exchange through options and other form of commodities. Furthermore, where are the most expensive food restaurants are at in the world? N.Y. city. It is also where social policies are established, the Corporate Media are the ones who are responsible for showing what is right to do to your body. It does not matter if it goes against the Bible. I have turned on the T.V. in the afternoon and have seen some of the worst activities a person can do to his or her bodies. What is worse, is that children see it and believe it is ok to do that same act. So good for food equal New York, scratch them off the list of places to live in or visit.Pleasant to the eyes equals “lust of the eyes”, is Las Angles the place that approves of showing every deviant behavior on T.V. and the movies. They state you should approve of these celebrities doing these perversions and say nothing bad about them. Furthermore, you need to teach your children that it OK to do such acts of perversions. What is worse is that they constantly take every opportunity to blaspheme GOD. It started when George Burns played GOD in the movies, then Morgan Freeman, and the last one I seen was the AMC the “preacher”. Las Angles is gone it has become a stink that only fire can get rid of that stink. And if you have not been getting mad about what has been shown on T.V. and the movies there is something wrong with you.To make one wise equal the “pride of life”, for those who read the Bible this Pride of life is the most pervasive when it comes to sins of this world. Read the verse below. This is Washington D.C. who believes their laws are more important than the Laws in THE WORD OF GOD. Currently, in the U.S. THE WORD OF GOD has no standing in the court of law. A matter of fact, if you do THE WORD OF GOD then you will either be locked up for life or face a death sentence. Go to THE WORD OF GOD and read for yourselves.Leviticus 24 11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)LEV-24:11[03-0114-3458]34V 276CH 20531BK 91479HW14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.LEV-24:14[03-0114-3461]28V 327CH 20582BK 91530HWThe amount of sin that Washington D.C. has brought on the U.S. is greater than the destruction than it will receive. All this could have been avoided if the founding fathers of the U.S. were not Christian cowards. They could have placed an article in the Constitution stating all social Issues will be judge by THE WORD OF GOD. However, they didn’t, for those whose names are written in the Book OF Life and are currently in heaven, I hope GOD showed them the current state of America. Also show them the blasphemes that are on T.V. and movies. The pride of life is also the sin that keeps people from getting save and perverting the HOLY WORD OF GOD. Man and woman believe they don’t need THE LORD JESUS CHRIST as their SAVIOR because they are good just the way they are and GOD would not send anyone to hell. The same type of people believe they can change THE HOLY WORD OF GOD because they are smarter than GOD and they know what GOD was trying to say to man. They also want to copy right THE WORD OF GOD by changing words in THE WORD OF GOD they can copy right. And before anyone call me a hypocrite, I do plan on copy right THE WORD OF GOD. What I have done was counted the words in each verse, chapter, book and whole HOLY BIBLE. There you have three cities which are far worse than Sodom and Gomorrah. Although I hope GOD adds San Francisco, Boston, Portland, Seattle, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Miami, Denver, all the cities around Washington D.C. For those who reading and thinking what of the children? The U.S. did not ask what of the children? When they dropped nuclear bombs on Japan or carpet bomb Vietnam. I know some might find the dates in THE WORD OF GOD but you don’t want to spare those who GOD has counted for death. Let them die and be judge after all if they live that only means more sin they will commit and worse treatment in the Lake of Fire. So, don’t use what you know about the end of these three cities to save them. Reread what I have told you (1 Kings 20:42) God can always destroy your city before N.Y. L.A. and D.C. Now days all it will take is a simple computer instruction and since computer also 666 can just change the destination location of a nuke to hit your city first. So keep your big mouth shut!!!!!!!A = 6 F = 36 K = 66 P = 96 U = 126B = 12 G = 42 L = 72 Q = 102 V = 132C = 18 H = 48 M = 78 R = 108 W = 138D = 24 I = 54 N = 84 S = 114 Y = 144E = 30 J = 60 O = 90 T = 120 Z = 150C = 18 m= 78O = 90 a= 6M = 78 r= 108P = 96 k= 66U = 126 o= 90T = 120 f= 36E = 30 b= 12R = 108 e= 30666 a= 6s= 114t= 120666New York also equals 666. You can’t replace the cities until they have been sacrificed. The devil would also want these cities destroyed why take the chance of them stating something on the air that could cause the antichrist a lot of pain like he is going to get a wound unto death on his right eye and arm. The other reason for destruction is like a sacrifice you do it when the time is right and don’t let them escape the judgement, that would make GOD enlarge the area for destruction. The same way a surgeon cut out bad flesh like gain green you don’t let it spread to healthy flesh. In the U.S. there might be places that can make it through tribulation but those places must use THE WORD OF GOD in order to establish the ruling Government and use the Laws out of THE WORD OF GOD to pass judgment on the population.Zechariah 11 17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.ZEC-11:17[38-0922-23046]36V 502CH 4890BK 605914HWWhich explains why the devil cast a third of the satellites to the ground. Now this is me assuming the stars which is a body in heaven that either gives light reflects light and in the case of black holes absorbs light. Since satellites reflects lights as well as radio and microwaves. Revelation 12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.REV-12:4[66-1179-30896]43V 111CH 5899BK 783534HWNow I know there may be some in this world that wants to see everyone get right with GOD and for that reason they are staying in places like New York city. First, you know there are some that will never get right with GOD either under Faith and Grace or after the Rapture under Faith, Grace and works. In the old days before digital scales there was a Balance scales with a weight on one side of the scales. Imagined a scale where GOD shows HIMSELF and even sends Moses and Elijah (one for the land the other for the people). In order to balance the scales, the sinner has to do works that are equivalent to what they are seeing. When you see the wrath of GOD which is a sign you have to do works that will put the scale in balance. I want you to memorize two verses then try to apply them during the time of tribulation. A man and his family built and stock a bomb shelter in their backyard. They have water and can go 7 years easily without going to the store and taking the mark of the beast. They have everything they need. However, their neighbor has not prepared and is not prepared to last 6 months much less 7 years. So, how can you love your brother and watch him and his family starve to death. The two commandments that the LORD GOD told you to do to please HIM. You may make it through the time of Jacob Trouble or if you prefer Tribulation but once the Church is in charge how long do you think you will last. You have won the Battle but lost the war.Mark 12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.MAR-12:30[41-0969-24704]32V 718CH 11041BK 643973HWMAR-12:31[41-0969-24705]22V 740CH 11063BK 643995HWThe end of this dispensation brings a beginning of a dispensation that will leave such a permanent mark on man that he or she will praise GOD forever just for making it through tribulation. Look at the verse below.Matthew 10 36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.MAT-10:36[40-0939-23454]11V 765CH 6912BK 616160HWIf this is what GOD is going to do with a man’s family think what he is going to do with the GOD hating, WORD OF GOD hating government agents, employees and bureaucrats. They will hunt the very men and women they work with. A government purge this will be done for those that supported anti GOD and pro worldly view of doing whatever you want and THE WORD OF GOD does not matter. Think about someone you work with gone to your backyard bar b que is now hunting you down to not only kill you but your whole family. This going on in the C.I.A., the N.S.A., The F.B.I. all purging because GOD put it within their heart and mind the same way HE put it in the heart and mind of Nebuchadnezzar to live like a beast. Even local police will start to kill one another.James 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.JAM-4:4[59-1150-30342]31V 95CH 1545BK 769130HWEvery presidential democratic candidate with their social agenda as well as all those in the U.S. congress and senate are not Christian nor is anyone who votes for them. The same way if I set down and eat a steak and call myself a vegan. They are an enemy of GOD also all those that vote for them. Currently there is impeach the President of the United States Trump what they should be saying is impeach these Dam liberal democrats but I know that is asking a lot. However, I would not shed a tear when the wrath of GOD falls on them nor any place they came from. The love of money, (which all republicans are guilty of the sin) may be the root of all evil but it is not the enemy of GOD and it is the lessor of two evils. That is why you can not love GOD and go against THE WORD OF GOD and elect a devil filled and devil loving liberal democrats. Once GOD has established HIS THRONE on the Temple mount how long do you think it is going to be before HE cleans house on these dam liberal democrats?1 Timothy 6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.1TI-6:10[54-1125-29799]29V 220CH 2003BK 757455HWThe claim that the Bible verse numbers are from the Inspiration of the HOLY SPIRIT is a hard pill to swallow for all these BIBLE perverters. However, when you attach that infinity to THE WORD OF GOD and THE WORD OF GOD has always been then you can get a blessing. So, in the Bible a man of sin will be born just like in the time of JESUS 6 times 666 which equals 3,996 when he was born. In this present time, we can get 9 times 666 which equals 5,994 what year would this be on the Jewish calendar? 5,994 minus 4,000 you get the year1, 994 to 1,995 because the Jewish year starts three quarter and 1,994 to 1,995 minus from the current years 2019.75 you get 25 to 24.75 his approximately age given that you don’t know his birth. Minus 24.75 from the current Jewish year 5780 which would make it 5,755.25 times four seasons you get 23021. He was most likely conceived in the last part of 1994 and given birth in 1995 as is part of generation Z the last generation. Zechariah 10:4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.ZEC-10:4[38-0921-23021]24V 131CH 4111BK 605135HWAs I stated before just as it was GOD’s will for JESUS CHRIST to die on the cross it is GOD’s will for the antichrist to become a world leader. You can’t fight the will of GOD you can only seek ways to please GOD during tribulation. Now some may want to do to the generation Z and all the 24.75 year old what Herod did to the males two years old in Bethlehem, but it can not be done."

Gretchen Whitmer’s veto of $35 million for their schools is allowed to stand.While traditional schools bring in $240 more per student under the new state budget, it seems increasingly likely that charter schools will be held to the same amount as last year — effectively a budget cut, when accounting for inflation.“We planned our budgets last spring with the confidence that the money would come through,” said Mike Conran, superintendent of Global Educational Excellence, a charter network that includes nine schools and 4,500 students in Michigan, including some in Detroit. “Now we have to look at phasing in curriculum instead of buying it all at once, reducing professional development, reducing teacher-to-student ratios.”Whitmer, a Democrat, had hoped to add $500 million to the state education budget. The budget that reached her desk, however, included an increase of roughly $300 million, and it didn’t send additional funds to disadvantaged students, as Whitmer had hoped.Calling the Republican proposals a “mess,” she axed $127 million from the proposed $15 billion education budget, characterizing the vetoes as a tactic that would push the legislature to renegotiate. Her line-item vetoes mostly targeted issues that are important to GOP lawmakers — things like charter schools and support for isolated rural school districts. On Tuesday, Republican leaders filed bills to reverse a number of Whitmer’s vetoes, including of charter funds. “There are a lot of charter schools that are doing a really good job for students, and they need that funding restored,” said Sen. Jim Runestad, a Republican.Yet there is no guarantee that the $35 million will be restored. The new Republican-backed bills don’t offer any additional concessions, and Whitmer could veto them, too.Rise & Shine!Thats Why I want our charter schools to have the money we need to get proper education but we need your help!"

The idea is we are not a political party in a sense. We aim to add amendments to the constitution that would allow for an open and honest president who has no prior commitments.   Citizens can vote via a double biometric check (eyes and fingerprints) from a secure connection using their smartphone and a secure partitioned app on their phone with notifications of their vote, or use any library or voting center. No more recounts just strong public transparency.   I would like to see this achieved by an artificially intellect non biased electoral program. Candidates would be analyzed for honesty in their answers. An AI system can be created to analyze the zeitgeist and the most important issues to americans  and assign a value to determine the questions for the analyzation process. A citizen can take a survey about what they want to see happening in the government and match them to a candidate in the candidate pool as a recommendation for voting. Each candidate must agree for a thorough data analysis and a thorough check as well as providing financial statements and  buisness interests as well as data gathering into their general public standing.The AI would recommend the top 10 front runners in rank based off of the president elects percentage of matching with the general population to allow citizens to know where their vote may count the most. I would like to eliminate campaign fund raising and to allocate travel expenses for top round candidates for their speaking engagements ect.This obviously would be funded by the immense cost savings by completing an overhaul that could replace entire bodies of government.  A small Congress  as in 7 members and Senate will  follow the same suit for sensitive non public decisions. These will be elected the same way and do not represent a state, they represent the whole of america. I want to see americans to actually have a say without districts just as a whole to any measure. I want to see the actual best candidate who is actually participating because he believes in democracy, true democracy. I want to see the political fighting to stop, no more government shut downs.We have the technology for this right now and can buy every american a smartphone with dual biometric checks before voting online securely. The department of treasury can also be exceptionally reduced by using an AI recommendation and appointed decision makers to either accept the recommendation or vote on a different solution.  I think we can improve so many things using materials at hand and agreeing on any measures that should be taken to improve the system.   For those of you afraid of an ""AI Uprising"" it will not be connected to the internet directly it would be fed information through an intermediary and housed in multiple locations in nuclear and EMP proof bunkers.    The military spending can be also cut dramatically by analyzing foreign risk, deterrent, on going programs and as for citizens votes regarding allotment of funds and the analysis will provide a basis of expected expenditures and hope to see less spent on standing military and allocate it towards equipment, drones and protecting the lives of our soldiers.  All of these arguments and political issues can be resolved by patriotism and the understanding that we can't have a perfect government but we can get much closer to not being democrats or Republicans, just Americans with personal views.   To have a more perfect system in place where people who vote regardless of their district still counts.   This is what we want, if you believe in this as a cause to have a truly free America please contribute share or post. We are trying to become recognized as an actual ballet party, or to choose a party to run under and enact this overhaul during the first administration. By Americans using metrics on their character, beliefs, empathy, readiness to defend if needed, intelligence factors with a quite extensive observation and a large candidate pool, we get a president that is actually concerned with America not their constituency.Ant American can also write amendments and measures and with enough backing introduce it to the monthly vote. An instance would be is a citizen who's gained enough signatures would be able to Visas with RFID technology and require them to have a smart phone and that acts as their visa and instead of a wall that costs more since the majority of illegal immigration happens through legal port entry and out-staying visas. With enough support it will be voted on in a national monthly vote.   In American history we've always flourished most by large infrastructure projects, I want a system that we can choose what industry subsidies to allow, and what programs we think we need such as a high speed rail system connecting all borders. These are just some personal ideas but it shouldn't be up to me, it shouldn't be up to corporate sponsorship and superpacs and backdoor arrangements.   Over time and hard work a system can make a determination based off of facts and social feelings and thoughts to prioritize and select a voting timeline based off of criteria. It could also allow citizens to auto vote by filling out a comprehensive survey or following keywords like ""pharmaceutical"" for alerts on that measure.   I am asking for 10 thousand dollars to get the ball rolling and try to become nationally recognized political group and guarantee a clear ledger of expenditures and progress updates. It's a Country for the People,  by the People. Let's use what we have labored for and accomplish the visions of our founding fathers.Please Sign, Post, Donate or communicate fears or questions regarding this. Richard Rule Founding Member"

The constant harassment and false claims they constantly bombard him with are preventing  him from doing an even better job than he has done already.  He's the best President in history, in my opinion and I want them to stop. I'm asking you to donate to my cause, to help make a voice and begin to end this corruption that is tearing this country apart. Don't fool yourself, Hillary Clinton wasn't the only corrupt politician in 2016. Look at them, they're all in this, they're all lying, cheating, manipulating and doing terrible things to OUR PRESIDENT and it's time we get off our butts and fight back.! I'm asking YOU to HELP ME  MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I'd like to go to Washington to lobby against this behavior with others like you, to protest this behavior in large groups but also TAKE LEGAL ACTION.We the AMERICAN PEOPLE have a LARGE VOICE TOGETHER WE STAND, THEY MUST LISTEN. I would like to start a petition and acquire as many signatures as possible of people willing to have their names put on a law suit against house democrats to be sued for the harassment of President Trump  in the name of the American people, stating we have had enough of their games and we will not tolerate anymore false accusations and lies, wasting the time this president has to accomplish what we voted him into office to achieve. I'd like to obtain legal counsel to file this law suit. We can no longer sit on our couches and hope that Jim Jordan and Rudy Giuliano and others like them, fighting for Donald Trump to win this fight, we, the American people, we, the Republican Party have to Stand up, NOW. It is time! We cannot wait any longer while AOC and the Squad get louder and louder and we do nothing, we're losing this fight, and President Trump can't can do it alone. If you or anyone you know would like to join me in this fight please contact me, I'm looking for as many people to fight this cause as I can get, as this means the world to me, I want to make a difference and stop this corruption  and I'm going to give it my all and I hope you will join me, So please help me!  Thank you for for I  joining me in this cause.

Hey y'all,As the South State Regional Director for the California Young Democrats, I'm responsible for getting our local Young Dems to conventions across California so they can represent their communities.

Our next convention is October 18-20 at Lake Tahoe — and it's approaching fast. We'll be voting on endorsements and taking part in training sessions to prepare us for 2020. It's really expensive getting our Young Dems up there and housing them though. The rooms work out to about $95 per person and the drive up is almost 9 hours long and gas intensive. Most of our members are high school and college students who can't necessarily afford that by themselves. That's why we need all the help we can get. Money shouldn't be an obstacle to our Young Dems getting to participate and benefit from this event.

Anything you can contribute will help!

But you only ""kind of, sort of"" know,  because you haven't had a government class since the 4th grade? Are you not quite sure who makes the laws in your town, or what you can do about the ridiculous one they just announced?  Or what you can do to protect your rights in a legal or court situation?Do you JUST want our government to be FAIR, and you can't understand why some people don't seem to understand what you mean by ""fairness"", and maybe even get angry about your wanting fairness? Do you wonder why liberals and conservatives BOTH constantly accuse each other of being ""fascists"" and ""Nazis"" these days, and maybe wonder what exactly fascism, ""Nazi-ism"", socialism, communism, capitalism, federalism, libertarianism and all the other ""isms"" really mean?  Or, how about ""oligarchy""?Do you wonder why, if we have majority rule, we can't just force people to be patriotic?  Or religious? Or to not be racists or homophobes?*   Do you want to speak up when people are talking nonsense about things that affect you and your family, but you worry that you don't know enough the basics of our governance structure to participate without feeling embarrassed (or, perhaps worse, being misinterpreted, labelled or shamed)?If you answered ""yes"" to any of those questions, you aren't alone.  Not by a long shot.   It turns out you especially aren't alone if you're between 14 and 40.  You went to school in the years when civics, government, world history and American history increasingly got smashed down into one little box to be taught all together, once in grade school and once in high school.  When we made more room for STEM, we didn't see that we were doing it by eroding the roots of American civic understanding and participation.  Turns out, we really need both--as is true of so many things in a healthy society.Americans' lack of knowledge about their own country is widespread and epidemic-- it affects all income and education levels, and all ideological bents.  And it hurts people.   A few  examples just from my own knowledge:   •   A 30-something relative who is a  successful dot-com executive admitted they weren't even sure what the difference was between a governor and a mayor, or exactly what the role the Democratic and Republican parties have in our official government.  Their Catholic school 'didn't really teach American government.'•  There's the poor girl from Colorado on YouTube who's brother publicly shamed her for being loudly and scornfully positive that there was no such place as ""the District of Columbia"" in the United States, since she had never heard of it.•   When listening to current news, my friend's college graduate kids constantly turn to their (lawyer and now government teacher) mother to ask ""Can he (or they) really  do that?""  We  all need know our own Constitution well enough to have a good sense of the answers to those kinds of questions--not everybody has that kind of resource at hand!•  There was my poor friend who claimed the whole justice system was ""broken"", when a judge ""sided with"" the terrible jerk she had sued, in a case where she had right and decency on her side.  But the jerk had submitted at least *some* independent witness testimony and documents that seemed to support some part of his sketchy version of the facts, while my friend had brought no evidence of her version, or to contradict his, but her own heartfelt testimony.   The justice system wasn't ""broken"":   she just sadly didn't know how to do her part to let it operate properly.•  Then there's a friend who encouraged me to take on this project:  she grew up following a parent's job all over the world, and so never got even a 4th gradegovernance class. She has a PhD in an important field and is one of the smartest people I know; yet she feels embarrassed and disadvantaged in conversation, because she's quite ignorant about the whats and whys of her country's political and legal systems.•  And perhaps worst of all: a 2016 survey that revealed that 40% of Americans under 40 don't believe it's important to live in a democratic society.  It isn't clear from the survey whether they actually know that democracy is the thing that allows them to vote and have a say in what happens to them, in how their laws are made and enforced, that protects their property from seizure by those richer and more powerful.  That AMERICANS, who have the first modern government explicitly founded on the principal that ordinary humans have the right to be free from  dictatorship, could believe that democracy isn't important, is heartbreaking and frightening.   This month's Harper's cover even asks ""Do We Need the Constitution?**American citizens are badly in need of an ""owner's manual"" for their constitutional democratic republic and its components.  We are hoping to create one that is both helpful and fun.  Through ""Shamefree Civics"" my friends and I are trying to create a non-judgmental, non-partisan, factual and multi-perspective place to learn about, and safely ask questions about, law and government in the United States.  We hope to help people better understand how American ideas of justice, equality, impartiality, liberty, property, representative republicanism, democracy AND inalienable individual rights shape our national, state, and local governments and court systems, even down to civic organizations and traffic court.  We hope to make it fun, funny, easy to understand, and easy to access.  Our plans include a podcast, a blog, a website, and a YouTube Channel, and hopefully even eventually a MOOC (massive open online classroom) where people can learn and discuss these issues without fear of being thought or called ""stupid"", ""ignorant"", ""libtard"", ""nazi"", ""fascist"", ""communist"" etc, etc.  We know--and will continually discuss-- that different people and regions have historically given more weight to some concepts than others.  In fact, we hope to explain that a bit, so that we might understand each other better as a nation and a people.  We certainly have our own beliefs, but within the initial group there are a range of beliefs, and we hope that with intellectual honesty, disclosure of our own interpretations, and opening up discussion of the range of views amongst ourselves and interview guests, we can provide meaningful, helpful information and ideas without pushing any one ideology.  At this point the people involved are, or have been, teachers, lawyers, historians, economists, farmers, entrepreneurs, executives, small business owners, a local government official, a Sunday school teacher, and a music industry figure, along with several current high school students.  We currently include traditional Democrats, traditional Republicans, Libertarians, young liberals who are trying to figure out exactly what they think about ""democratic socialism"",  and young religious conservative populists.  We're still a small group, but so far we come from both cities and countryside in New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, New York, California, Virginia, Oregon, and Texas.The conversations are often high-spirited, if not downright heated, but we always learn something from each other, and we keep each other honest and thoughtful.   And these people know stuff, so if you have questions, they have answers and won't make you feel dumb for asking.  Please join us when our podcast and website go live! *Hint:  We *don't* have majority rule or direct democracy for many things; we have a written national Constitution to spell those things out, and prevent violation of the few ""inalienable rights"" that the founding fathers and we as Americans declare that all its citizens are born with.  As it turns out, pure majority rule (direct democracy) unrestrained by established rules of law has historically resulted in theft, abuse, injustice and even mass violence by one group against the lives and property of the other.  I can think of at least five things my friends might say to differently about that.  Tune in and let's discuss it--it's really interesting!**Spoiler alert:  My answer is ""Yes.  Definitely.""   Tune in to find out why, and tell me why you might think otherwise!"

Save the Electoral CollegeOur Mission:  To defend the Electoral College by providing                                 education thru TV, radio, paper and digital media.  2016:  Donald Trump Beats Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton wins the popular vote.                 People want to abolish the Electoral College.2000:  George W. Bush Beats Al Gore.  Al Gore wins the popular vote.               People want to abolish the Electoral College.People are saying the Electoral College is too old, archaic, not fair, doesn’t work, has failed, needs to be abolished, doesn’t represent our “Democracy”, etc.  They say the President and Vice-President need to be elected by a national popular vote.  We Disagree.Our Founders gave us a Republic, with many checks & balances.Benjamin Franklin exclaimed that the Founders gave us a Republic - if we can keep it.  The Electoral College is a corner-stone to our Republic.Perhaps the Electoral College is working the way it was designed!  Five times a Presidential candidate has won the national popular vote and has not become President:      1824:  John Quincy Adams won over Andrew Jackson.      1876:  Rutherford B. Hayes won over Samuel Tilden.      1888:  Benjamin Harrison won over Grover Cleveland.      2000:  George W. Bush won over Al Gore.      2016:  Donald J. Trump won over Hillary Clinton.     Additionally, 19 times a President has been elected without getting 50% of      the popular vote.  That is 42%.  These Presidents include, but not limited to:       JFK, Abraham Lincoln and Bill Clinton.This doesn’t mean the Electoral College failed.  It means the Electoral Collegeis actually working the way it was designed!  Why the Electoral College?  Here are a few reasons from our Founders:     1.   Every State is its own Sovereignty – States’ Rights.        2.   Rural areas would be ignored in favor of those with bigger populations.     3.  “Election of the President is to be made by the States” - James Madison     4.  Distrust of Elected Leaders to Elect the President.     5.  Distrust of the people to Elect the President.     6.  Fear of the “Tyranny of the Majority”.     7.  Fear of Pure Democracy.     8.  A deep-rooted distrust of government.     9.  The United States is a Republic.Alexander Hamilton wrote:       ""If the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent.''We hear and heard a lot about:     1.  Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by about 2.8 million votes (2.1%).     2.  Al Gore winning the popular vote by about 550,000 votes (0.51%).We do and did not hear about:     1.  Trump and Bush won the overall popular vote of 49 States out of 50            – 98% of the country.     2.  If you take California out of the election, Donald Trump won the            popular vote by about 1.4 Million Votes (1.14%).     3.  If you take California out of the total, George Bush won the            popular vote by about 750,000 Votes (0.80%).The Electoral College is working the way it was designed! Now, this is not about Republicans vs. Democrats.  It’s about the ElectoralCollege, why it exists; and the movement to abolish it.Electoral College is Under Fire to be Abolished     Today, more people are calling for the Electoral College to be abolished.       Commentators, journalists, celebrities, 2020 Presidential Candidates      (even President Trump stated it was archaic), etc.       The movement to a National Popular Vote is stronger than ever and the      Electoral College is under fire, guided mostly by emotion rather than reason.     Case in Point:  In 2019, Tennessee Congressman Steve Cohen introduced a      Bill in Congress to abolish the Electoral College.  He said in a statement that his      proposal was inspired by his party’s defeats in two presidential elections in the      past generation — Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.       Pure emotion and no reason.       The organization National Popular Vote is pushing an interstate compact      under which each State would pledge to deliver all their electoral votes      to the nationwide popular vote winner. 16 States have approved a bill      already (32%).  In 8 other States, the Bill has passed at least one House      of the Legislature.  If approved, that is a total of 24 States (48%).       Still think a national popular vote will never happen?      This is a way around the Electoral College, very disguised.      If the Interstate Compact was in effect in 2000 and 2016, connecting     States Electoral Votes to the national popular vote, the Electoral      College results would have been:     1.  Hillary Clinton 283 – 248 win over Donald J. Trump.      2.  Al Gore 314 – 223 win over George W. Bush.     In addition, there is a coalition of prominent law firms and      professors that have also filed four federal lawsuits claiming      the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College (of States)      distorts presidential campaigns and violates the U.S. Constitution.     And there are other organizations trying to do the same.     Again, this is not about Republicans vs. Democrats.  It’s about the      Electoral College, why it exists; and the movement to abolish it      with a national popular vote.     As we have shown above, California would dictate whom the      President is over all the other 49 States.The Future Dominance of California:     On February 10, 2015, California had 17,717,936 registered voters.       On February 10, 2017, California had 19,987,449 registered voters.       That is 2,269,513 new voter registrations in 2 years going into 2020.       We do not know the number of new registrations from 2017 to the      present.  We wait for the February 10, 2019 report.  If the number      increases by the same amount, that is over 4.5 million new voters for      the State of California.     If there was a national popular vote, California alone will dictate      whom the President and Vice-President will be.Education     It is easy to discard what we do not know or understand.  Every      Elected Leader or person running for Office talks about Education,      Education, and Education every 2 years.      How about educating on the Electoral College and our form of     Government?  People need to understand what they have before      they throw it out on pure emotions.Knowledge is power. We know education is a big issue (few examples):     1.  When only 24% of the people can name the 3 branches of government.     2.  When only 1 in 3 Americans can pass the U.S. citizenship test.     3.  When only 50% of college graduates know how long the Terms of            Office are for Congress and Senate.     4.  When only 28% percent of Americans can name three of the             original 13 States.      5.  When less than 33% of college graduates know that James Madison            is the “Father of the Constitution”.     6.  When 12% of Americans think General Dwight Eisenhower led            troops in the Civil War.     7.  When 50% of Americans believe the War of 1812 and the            Emancipation Proclamation  were BEFORE the American Revolution.      With a sample of just the above, we know education is a problem.     It is easy to discard what we do not know or understand.       The train has left the station to abolish the Electoral College.       All emotion and no reason.            You may think it may never happen, but the Constitution has      been amended before (27 times).       The organization National Popular Vote is well funded and is      circumventing the Constitution.     The only way to stop this train is education.  Knowledge is power.Who we are and our Mission:     I have worked on the ground for political campaigns for over 15 years.     My associates the same.      We are looking to produce TV, radio, multi-media and other forms of      communication to reach the public in support of the Electoral College      and stop the movement towards a national popular vote.     We are looking for $20 million.  This is an information endeavor.     The funds are for, but not limited to:     1.   Company Start up.     2.   Legal     3.   Production and distribution for TV, radio, internet      4.   If possible, Super Bowl commercial     5.   Administration / Office     ""Googling"" Electoral College and sitting at home is not enough.       We need to hit the airwaves in every form to make the Electoral College     a ""kitchen conversation"" and in the media.     Benjamin Franklin was asked about our form of government:    ""Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?  A Republic or a Monarchy?        Benjamin Franklin responded:  ""A Republic, if you can keep it"".     The Electoral College is a corner-stone of our republic.If you are:     1.  In favor of the Electoral College.     2.  In favor of State sovereignty.     3.  In favor of keeping the remaining foundation and pillar of            check and balance in the election of the President.     4.  In favor of one State not rolling over the other 49 States.     5.  In favor of stopping the train that has left the station.Please support and donate today.Thank you for your time.The Electoral College is working the way it was designed!

$0 raised of $5,000                    ",https://www.gofundme.com/sight-to-unite-the-white-despite-the-fight,"Massapequa, NY",United for All,"Created September 2, 2019","I'm raising money to start a non-profit charity to organize and protect people around the world. The name is United For All (UFA), and I envision this group to become similar to the NAACP or ACLU but for all people. Us citizens have some of the best solutions for our problems, however most of us don't have a voice in our own government unless we belong to a lobby of some sort. I'm a scientist, an inventor, an environmentalist, and a businessman. I care deeply about human rights and fairness for all people.      The donations will allow me to build a website to unite the people and create a non-profit organization. Together our members will create a huge voting block and political influence. I'm a political independent and I vote for the best candidate not the best party. I actually disagree with the whole ""voting along party lines"" theory anyway. I'm going to try and keep politics out of this group since we are republican, democrat, independent, progressive, and conservative...I call myself a CLIP, Conservative, Libertarian Independent, progressive. The order is insignificant it's just the best fitting acronym.     The first thing I would like to work on is solving this whole bicycle issue in NYC. Here is my solution. Elevated bike paths above the avenues and main cross streets similar to the high line on the west side. We can make them more narrow than the streets so sun can still shine down on the sidewalks and building lobbies. In the middle of these elevated bike paths can be a center lane for pedestrians, tourists, and those out on leisure time. On the right side of the center median would be the north bike lanes, and on the left side would be the south bike lanes. We can connect these elevated bike/pedestrian paths on the wider east west streets like Chambers, Canal, Delancey , Houston, 14th st , 23rd st, 34th st, 42nd st, 57th st, etc.. Also lead into central park and the other parks along the East river and Hudson river and connect to the bridges and maybe even the tunnels. Anyway we can also install public restrooms and covered sitting areas in the pedestrian median area for tourists to congregate and take photos out of the way of the hustle and bustle on the sidewalks. Plus we can plant many trees, bushes, and flowers which will actually increase the overall air quality in the city. Another idea that just popped into my head is motor vehicle exhaust scrubbers. We can fit air intake ducts and an entire integrated HVAC ventilation system to intake dirty vehicle exhaust air, filter it, and re-exhaust clean air back into the city through vents. This combined with thousands of trees and bushes will definitely provide cleaner air for us all. I would also eliminate street parking in most of midtown and all of the avenues and major cross streets. We would have to add more municipal parking garages at the same price as street meters. Make accommodations in areas where there is free street parking for free garage parking, for limited times anyway. The exact rules can be ironed out later but the point is get parked cars off the street and out of the way by giving people a better alternative at the same price as street meters. the city may have to fund some of these garages or share revenue between those with meters.  I have more great ideas and a really cool invention, but that is another story.     We will also gladly accept women and protect them and their rights. I'm a fairest above all and women have been oppressed for centuries on this planet. Times are much better especially in this country, however there are still many inequalities and this can become a great platform for us all to discuss these inequalities logically and educate and help each other understand our differences.     Finally, I'm going to post something I wrote several years ago. I had already been through some life changing experiences and I had found my true love finally after searching for her my whole life. She wasn't wearing a wedding ring and although she was on television, somehow I knew it was her. I still know she is my true love although she has yet to realize this or act on it. We belong together and someday we will both become our first planetary Ambassadors and fulfill our destiny as true lovers...This is the original version it was not redacted, lol... Interested people who would like to join this group please email your name, address, email address, and phone number: UACAP99@gmail.com                                                                      UNITED FOR ALL                          The Good People of Earth’s Declaration of Independence  This is our Declaration of Independence, not from our governments, but from hatred of all types, creeds, and colors. This idea first came to me a few years ago and this was going to be a group of unity, piece, and racial harmony called “unite the white” here in the United States of America. I very recently decided to include ALL PEOPLE into this group. My wife is a Hispanic immigrant who risked her life to be a part of the melting pot called America. Our children are of multiple races, as are most Americans. We need to unite all good people of the world to stop oppression and hatred for everyone. I want to create a website where people of different races, religions, and nationalities can post stories, blogs, and ideas so we can better understand each other and achieve world piece. We are all one race, the human race and we need to unite as a planet, before it’s too late. Two days ago, was the anniversary of the great Dr. Martin Luther King’s famous and inspiring “I have a dream” speech and it was on that same day that I had my revelation of including ALL PEOPLE into this group of understanding, love, and ultimately world peace. I have always believed in racial and international harmony. However, I lost my job several months ago and I don’t have a lot of money, so I need your help to promote this group. I’m asking for donations of any denomination to build the website and promote this group. I will also be seeking other people of different colors, creeds, genders, and nationalities to become members and to help me run this group. You do not need to give a donation to become a member, all you need to do is ask. However, this group is for the rich and the poor and everyone in between, so if you can afford to please give whatever you can to help promote world peace and understanding of all people of this beautiful planet we call Earth. I would also like to promote Green Technology to save this planet, which will be phase two of this group called UNITED FOR ALL. Together we can change the world and free the good people of Earth from oppression.  I truly believe that the United States political system needs to change. It seems these days that our politicians are for sale to the highest bidder (the campaign donors). Then when they get elected to office, they are indebted to the campaign donors, who are the elite rich (the 1%), and not to the public, who they were elected to serve. These days in America the only people who have enough money to “donate” are the elite rich who then get laws written in their favor. I believe that this is the reason why the income gap between the rich and the poor is widening and I also believe that this system is destroying the very fabric of our nation. In addition, politicians then spend half of their term fundraising to get re-elected instead of doing the job that they were elected to do. It should be illegal to “bribe” politicians, after all our founding fathers created this great nation to be governed by the people for the people. We should outlaw lobbyists and campaign donors and switch to a system of 100% publicly funded political campaigns. This would allow politicians to create laws to help ALL PEOPLE not just their “campaign donors”, and they won’t have to spend half of their term fundraising to get re-elected. By-laws are supposed to be notes from a meeting, not what billionaires do to our government. I also believe that people should run for office based on who they are not what party they belong to. This creates “gridlock” in Washington and not very much gets done. Politicians increasingly “tow the party line” and block each other’s ideas, and most of the time they don’t even answer questions from the media until they check with their party to see how they feel. We may have to give politicians raises to make up for “campaign freebies” and also to more closely match the salaries of company CEO’S. Then we might attract good people who want to help everyone not just their campaign donors. I truly believe that these two changes will fix our broken government and help us to become the great nation we once were; the UNITED states of America. I thank you for your time and please pass this along to all of your friends and family."

By abandoning his role as mayor in favor of growing his own personal ""brand"" Bill DeBlasio has neglected the people of New York City and the issues of homelessness, crime, drug addiction, and poverty within our five boroughs.Some Additional Background in case you thought Bill actually had (or has) a chance...On May 16, 2019 our Mayor declared his intention to run for the President of the United States.  Per a Quinnipiac poll in April, it was clear to everyone except our Mayor. ""De Blasio should not run for president, New York City voters said 76 - 18 percent. Every listed party, gender, racial, borough and age group agrees that the mayor should not (have) hit the campaign trail.""""It would be bad for New York City if de Blasio runs for president, voters say 47 - 32 percent, including 43 - 35 percent among Democrats"" ""Mayor Bill de Blasio's flirtation with a 2020 White House bid is prompting a rare moment of unity among New Yorkers. Three-quarters of them say, 'Mr. Mayor: Don't do it,'"" said Mary Snow, polling analyst for the Quinnipiac University Poll."

Repeated attempts to resolve these issues through legislation had collapsed in the face of the inflexible partisan positions staked out by Democrats and Republicans.The first attempt to resolve the issue came in August 1861, with the First Confiscation Act declaring that all property used in aiding, abetting, or promoting the insurrection was “to be seized, confiscated, and condemned.” Fearful that the legislation might appear a desperate response to the Union defeat at First Bull Run, and might also be unconstitutional, Lincoln reluctantly signed the bill, and then immediately ordered Attorney General Edward Bates not to enforce its provisions. Lincoln’s timidity angered the more radical members of his party.The following summer Lincoln again found himself at odds with several Republican members of congress. Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull’s Second Confiscation Act authorized the government seizure of “all the estate and property, money, stocks, credits, and effects” of anyone in rebellion against the United States. Furthermore, “all slaves of persons…engaged in rebellion…that [come] under the control of the government of the United States…shall be forever free of their servitude.” The Second Confiscation Act lacked provisions for enforcement and proved no more effective than its predecessor.Confiscation by the Union military, however, proved to be an altogether different matter. Commanders on the front lines seized abandoned Southern plantations and their slaves. But Congress and the Lincoln administration proved unable to dispel the uncertainty surrounding experiments in free labor by agreeing on policies for the seized lands.Black leaders, wary of Congress and the administration, had put forth their own ideas regarding possible land redistribution. In November 1861, the Anglo-African newspaper published an editorial titled “What Shall Be Done with the Slaves?” that argued when the war ended “there will be four million free men and women and children, accustomed to toil” who should be awarded the confiscated land.The growing likelihood that a Union victory would bring an end to chattel slavery led many black leaders to join the frequent calls for land redistribution. For tens of thousands of freedmen, ownership of the land they had labored on as slaves promised economic self-sufficiency and a path to citizenship. Nowhere was that promise more eagerly embraced than in Savannah in January 1865.Union Commanders on the Front lines seized abandoned Southern plantations and their slavesSherman and his army had occupied that city following their seven- week march from Atlanta through northern Georgia. “I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the City of Savannah,” he telegraphed the president on December 22. But controversy had tainted Sherman’s gift. On December 9, Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis had ordered a pontoon bridge over Ebenezeer Creek, near Savannah, disassembled before the freedmen traveling in the army’s wake could cross. The result, in the words of one Union cavalry officer, caused hundreds of blacks to rush “by the hundreds into the turbid stream,” where many drowned. Confederate forces captured those who remained on land. On January 9, 1865, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton arrived in Savannah to investigate the incident.The secretary of war asked Sherman to arrange a meeting with leaders from Savannah’s black community. On Thursday evening, January 12, Stanton and Sherman got together with 20 ministers and lay leaders from the city’s black churches; at least 15 of the attendees had at one time been enslaved. In response to a question about how freedpeople could take care of themselves, 67-year-old Garrison Frazier, a former slave and the group’s spokesman, remarked that the best way was “to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor….” All but one of the group wanted to live separately from whites, “for there is a prejudice against us in the South that will take years to get over.”Sherman issued Special Field Orders No. 15 four days after the meeting. It “reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States…the islands from Charleston, south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. Johns River, Florida.” Subject to several bureaucratic strictures, “each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground…in the possession of which land the military authorities will afford them protection, until such time as they can protect themselves, or until Congress shall regulate their title.”The order encouraged the enlistment of “young and able-bodied negroes” in the service of the United States, and guaranteed anyone enlisting the right to “locate his family in any one of the settlements at pleasure.” Finally, the order provided that “no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside; and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves, subject only to the United States military authority and the acts of Congress.”Michael Fellman argues in his book Citizen Sherman that Sherman solved a number of problems bothering him by issuing Special Field Orders No. 15, as the general had washed his hands of his “negro problem” by purging his columns of large numbers of black camp followers and passing them onto a man he despised, Brig. Gen. Rufus Saxton, the Union commander stationed at Port Royal, S.C.Saxton, as inspector of settlements and plantations, was responsible for assigning each family 40 acres of land and furnishing a “possessory title” (which granted the right to use but not own the land, subject to the president’s approval). He sought and received assurances from Stanton that the federal government would not renege on its promise of land. Under Sherman’s orders, the Union Army also provided the freedmen with mules no longer fit for military use to work the land.Saxton efficiently processed thousands of requests for land, and by June 1865, approximately 40,000 blacks had settled on 400,000 acres. Despite the enthusiastic response of the freedmen, the settlement of Sherman’s Reservation quickly encountered problems. One was largely practical. Many of the freedmen received their plots too late for spring planting. This created the need for temporary relief—the provision of food, clothing, and shelter—that the government was ill-prepared to meet. Of greater long-term significance was the change in political circumstances, as Sherman’s order was out of sync with the Lincoln administration’s evolving Reconstruction policy. (Library of Congress) Freedman’s FriendRufus Saxton was an excellent choice to implement Sherman’s Field Orders No. 15. The Massachusetts native and West Pointer was an outspoken abolitionist and recipient of the Medal of Honor for his command of the Union defenses at Harpers Ferry in the spring of 1862. After his reassignment to South Carolina, Saxton was instrumental in the organization of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, the first official black regiment.On March 3, 1865, less than two months after Sherman issued his order, the formation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands added a new, often confusing layer of administrative oversight to the Sherman land grants. Although Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, commissioner of the Bureau, immediately ordered Saxton to continue his work, the heretofore autonomous venture in land redistribution was quickly caught up in larger political currents in the wake of Lincoln’s assassination.Andrew Johnson’s ascendancy to the presidency in April 1865 marked the beginning of a bitter struggle over the seized lands, as he instituted a lenient policy of special pardons that restored most of the rights of former Confederates who swore an oath of allegiance to the United States. Simultaneously, Howard was putting the infant Freedmen’s Bureau on a collision course with the new president. His “Circular No. 13” issued on July 28, 1865, instructed bureau agents that land redistribution was the official policy, despite the president’s emerging amnesty program. Had Howard’s policy stood, as many as 900,000 acres of plantation lands previously belonging to slave owners might have been redistributed. But on August 16, the president countermanded Howard’s circular and said that if Southern whites obtained a pardon and paid their taxes, they could reclaim their land. In September, in response to a direct presidential order, Howard accepted strict new criteria for designating a property as “officially confiscated,” which in many places had the effect of ending land redistribution. By September 1865, many former owners of the land in the Sherman Reservation had begun demanding the return of their property based on the special presidential pardons. An order from President Johnson to Howard supported these claims.Saxton’s sympathy for the freedmen virtually guaranteed that he would refuse to comply. “Thousands of them are already located on tracts of forty acres each,” he wrote Howard. “Their love of the soil and desire to own farms amounts to a passion—it appears to be the dearest hope of their lives.” Furthermore, Saxton argued in a second letter, “the faith of the Government is solemnly pledged to these people who have been faithful to it and we have no right now to dispossess them of their lands.”Johnson’s second order to restore the lands also instructed Howard to negotiate a mutually satisfactory agreement between the freedmen and the former owners. The bureau commissioner’s first stop was Edisto Island, one of the Sea Islands off South Carolina. There he tried to get the freedmen to quit the land in return for guarantees that they would be hired by the land’s former owners. Edisto’s black residents refused and in response gave Howard a petition to deliver to Johnson. The freedmen argued they were not truly free without the land.Saxton’s removal marked the death knell for land redistributionThe petition remains a painful reminder of the sense of betrayal among the former slaves. “You ask us to forgive the landowners of our island,” wrote the petitioners. “You only lost your right arm [Howard had been wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks in 1862] in the war and might forgive them. The man who tied me to a tree and gave me 39 lashes; who stripped and flogged my mother & sister & …who combines with others to keep away land from me…that man, I cannot well forgive. Does it look as if he has forgiven me,” asked the petitioners, “since he tries to keep me in a condition of helplessness?”Howard reported the refusal to Stanton. The secretary of war, whose animosity to the new president would eventually lead to his dismissal and Johnson’s subsequent impeachment, suggested that Howard’s only obligation was to try to get an agreement. If an understanding was not forthcoming, the blacks could stay. The Edisto petition, however, fell on deaf ears in Washington, and on January 15, 1866, Johnson ordered Saxton removed from his position.Two weeks later, William Henry Trescot, who was in Washington to lobby on behalf of those South Carolinians whose lands had been confiscated, met with Sherman and other officers to discuss the genesis of Special Field Orders No. 15. Sherman told the group that his intention was to offer a temporary solution. In a follow-up letter to the president, he wrote, “I knew of course we could not convey title and merely provided ‘possessory’ titles, to be good as long as War and our Military Power lasted. I merely aimed to make provision for the Negroes who were absolutely dependent upon us, leaving the value of their possessions to be determined by after events or legislation.” As one historian has argued, “What the general had managed in No. 15 was a strategist’s version of bait and switch, at once a magnetic distraction for black people and sufficiently high-minded to leave the secretary [Stanton]…‘cured of that Negro nonsense.’”Saxton’s removal in early 1866 sounded the death knell for land redistribution to the freedmen. Ordered by the president to return the confiscated land in a way that was mutually agreeable to the original owners and the freed people who had claimed it, Howard set out to do the impossible. White Southerners’ resistance to land ownership by blacks proved intense. The “feeling against any ownership of land by negroes is so strong,” wrote one Alabamian, “that the man who should sell small tracts to them would be in actual personal danger.”The restoration of confiscated lands to their antebellum owners proceeded at a breakneck pace. On January 31, 1866, the Freedmen’s Bureau controlled 223,600 acres; within 18 months that total had shrunk to 75,329 acres. In July 1866, the congressional reauthorization of the Freedmen’s Bureau included a provision returning all the lands included in the Sherman Reservation to their original owners. Those freed people continuing to occupy confiscated land were generally given a choice: Sign work contracts, thereby accepting peonage, or leave. Most left.Peacebroker: A period engraving presents an idealized view of the federal government’s role in protecting former slaves from angry ex-Confederates. (The Granger Collection, New York)The Johnson administration’s determination to restore the antebellum patterns of landownership alarmed many in Congress who continued to seek a means of offering freedmen their own land. Signed into law on June 21, 1866, the Southern Homestead Act opened 46 million acres of public lands in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi to settlement. Until June 1868, the land was divided into 80-acre parcels; thereafter the size of the parcels doubled to 160 acres. Homesteaders could not purchase the property. They had to occupy and improve the land for five years before acquiring full ownership.Ex-Confederates were banned from obtaining land, but only until January 1, 1867. George Julian, an Indiana congressman and longtime opponent of slavery, had drafted the most important provision of the law. “No distinction or discrimination shall be made in the construction or execution of this act on account of race or color,” he wrote. The law failed, however, because Southern bureaucrats frequently failed to inform blacks of their exclusive right to file land claims, the land was often of poor quality, and impoverished black settlers generally had little to invest in their homesteads. The program registered fewer than 4,500 homestead claims before the law was repealed in 1876.Impoverished black settlers had little to invest in their homesteadsBy the end of the Civil War, the federal government controlled 850,000 acres that had been confiscated from Rebel Southerners under wartime provisions. Nearly half the acreage was located in the Sherman Reservation, where thousands of freedmen had claimed 40-acre plots along the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and northern Florida. Thousands more lived on leased properties at Norfolk, New Bern, and Roanoke Island.For a time, writes historian Douglas Egerton, “It appeared that federal policy was about to enable the birth of a black landowning class.” Freedmen shared an almost universal belief that they had a right to the lands they had been working, many for several years. “Our wives, our children, our husbands, has been sold over and over again to purchase the lands we now locates upon,” argued Bayley Wyat, a freedman living in northern Virginia. But, Egerton continues, it was simply too “baffling and revolutionary” an idea that “those who had produced the region’s wealth should now benefit from it.”Following the Civil War, public discussions about compensating former slave owners far outnumbered those about compensating former slaves. A proposal that slaves freed by the Emancipation Proclamation be paid for labor after January 1, 1863, fell on deaf ears. The Johnson administration’s decision to return the confiscated land quickly disabused freedmen of any notion that they might be rewarded for their wartime loyalty, as demonstrated by the valiant service of more than 180,000 black troops and the work of thousands more on Southern plantations under the Yankee army’s control.Within a year of the war’s end, the Freedmen’s Bureau had returned more than 400,000 acres to their antebellum owners. By the middle of 1867, all but 75,000 acres were in the hands of their original owners. Few decisions have had a more long-lasting and deleterious impact on American society than the Johnson administration’s decision to force the freedmen off confiscated lands. “Could the nation have been induced to listen to those stalwart Republicans, Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner,” Frederick Douglass lamented in 1880, “some of the evils which we now suffer would have been averted. The negro would not today be on his knees…supplicating the old master class to give him leave to toil….[And] he would not now be swindled out of his hard earnings.” Sited :Rick Beard, an independent historian, author, and museum consultant, writes from Harrisburg, Pa."

Every couple years there's some talk about reparations or cheap ass talk about helping 'people of color,' and then after every election, they go back to doing the same things they've always done. Don't get me wrong, I'm not happy with republicans either, but at least they have the good sense to not make ridiculous promises they have no intention of keeping or talk about keeping hot sauce in their purse as if that somehow puts us on some level playing field. Patricia Arquette is ashamed of being white? How about…instead of pontificating on Twitter to make HERSELF feel better…she help out someone in the community that needs it?
 
So here's the deal. The slavery in the South that started the Civil War, Jim Crowe laws, and the KKK were all started by the democrats - I don't care about parties switching or the Southern Strategy, all that evil shit happened under the Dems (look it up), and it's time for them to ante up, so here is a Reparations fund for you to put your money where your mouth is.
 
You may be asking why I'm doing this and where the money would go - that all depends on what we recieve. Maybe it's paying off someone's electric bill so their lights don't go out. Maybe it's a house or rent or tuition payment to keep someone in school. Maybe it's a grant to help someone start up a new business. I don't know exactly how it's going to work, but once we do start to get donations, if you have a need, send an email to demreparations@gmail.com and I'll distribute everything as soon as I can. Given the stupid political climate that we live in now, absolutely everything will be kept anonymous so that nobody is doxed, fired, threatened, or anything. I will post proof of payments via social media so that everyone knows I'm not hoarding the money - my family is doing well enough, we don't need it.

You have to appreciate a man that takes giant steps! I just hope Mr. Trump realizes China’s ability to reach out and touch someone and will take greater precautions with his personal security. The people of this country need to speak with one voice to assure Mr. Trump of victory in 2020 so that he can assure his own survival by not putting himself at risk campaigning in public. The American people also need to acknowledge the importance of what he is trying to accomplish by confronting China on trade, and the best way to do that is to make it known that we are willing to deal with whatever temporary hardships may come as a result of these necessary actions. We may have to tighten our belts and do without some things for a period of time but the end result will be well worth it, especially if the American people will step up to the challenge and participate in the movement to “Occupy County Court Yards” in safer, small numbers in any one county, but in great numbers, difference making numbers, when totaled up.The fastest and surest way for England’s new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson to get Brussels to agree to an exit plan would be for Boris to get Queen Elizabeth II to grant Ireland sovereignty over the island to avoid having renewed border issues. He could always argue that when China is large and in charge, probably not until after she has passed away, King Charles could follow in his brother, Vladimir Putin’s footsteps and take back the whole island. Speaking of everyone’s favorite ex-KGB agent, it would seem a little tit-for-tat maneuver for Putin’s little tat when he annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine is called for. Since none of Trumps hawks will let him have an easy victory in Venezuela, Trump should take on a slightly tougher challenge, and order a massive build up of military power in Kazakhstan. By drawing a new line at the most narrow land connection between Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Trump can cut Russia off from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and drive Russia out of Ukraine and Crimea. This would give Trump the clout to call for, not regime change, but new, free and fair elections in Russia. The end result will certainly be that a new president and prime minister will be elected that align themselves more with the West than the East.  Trump claims serious trade negotiations with China to begin Darlene Superville, 8/26/2019 Associated PressTrump said his trade negotiators had received two ""very good calls"" from China Sunday, hours after Trump waffled on whether he regretted the one-upmanship on tariffs Friday. Trump at first seemed to express regret over the escalating trade war, but the White House later said Trump's only regret was that he didn't impose even higher tariffs on China. Trump claimed the Sunday evening conversations were a sign China is serious about making a deal. ""I think we're going to have a deal, because now we're dealing on proper terms. They understand and we understand,"" Trump said as he met with Egypt's president on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in France. ""This is the first time I've seen them where they really want to make a deal. And I think that's a very positive step,"" Trump added. Trump declined to identify those involved in the most recent conversation and whether he is in direct contact with President Xi Jinping. Trump added Monday that the two sides will begin 'talking very seriously,"" saying that after the calls he believes the Chinese ""mean business."" A Chinese delegation had been expected to travel to Washington in September to continue talks and that remained the case even after Trump's escalation following China's tariff announcement last Friday. It was unclear if Trump was referring to the previously scheduled talks next month or some other conversations. There was no immediate comment from the Chinese. Trump's optimistic comments on China came as he commented for the first time on the surprise appearance at the G-7 summit by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, and as the international gathering put Trump's differences with his counterparts on display. World leaders had encouraged Trump all weekend to deescalate the conflict with China, he clashed with French President Emmanuel Macron over France's new digital services tax, and he broke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in not forcefully condemning North Korea's recent ballistic missile launches. But Trump on Monday claimed the reports of disagreements were overblown, starting with the Zarif visit. (See interview with Steve Mnuchin and Lawrence Kudlow. Paraphrase of Mr. Kudlow: Every single G-7 leader agreed that somethings gotta be done about China’s unfair trade practices.) Uncharacteristically silent Sunday while Zarif was in France, Trump insisted that Macron had asked his ""approval"" before asking Zarif to attend, as he looks to lower tensions in the Persian Gulf. And Trump rejected the assertion by some allies that the invitation to Zarif was somehow an insult. ""I spoke to President Macron yesterday and I knew everything he was doing and I approved whatever he was doing and I thought it was fine,"" Trump said of the Zarif talks. He said he thought it was too soon for he and Zarif to meet, but wouldn't say whether any Americans had come in contact with the Iranian. The Iranian government had said they would not meet with any Americans during the 8-hour visit to France. Trump said there could soon be time for a meeting between himself and Iranian officials, but refused to lay out clear steps forward or say if he'd be willing to accede to a plan put forward by Macron to offer Iran some relief from crushing petroleum sanctions in exchange for restarting nuclear talks. He said of the Iran talks, ""It's all very new. They're under a lot of financial stress."" After a breakdown in talks this spring, Trump and Xi agreed in June to resume negotiations. But talks in Shanghai in July ended with no indication of progress. Negotiators talked by phone this month and are due to meet again in Washington next month. Trump last week hiked tariffs on China after China taxed some U.S. imports in retaliation for a previous round of imports levied by Trump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 600 points Friday as the latest escalation in the trade war rattled investors. The broad sell-off sent the S&P 500 to its fourth straight weekly loss. Trump also ""ordered"" U.S. corporations to find alternatives to doing business in China and threatened to declare a national emergency to enforce it. Trump softened the threat Sunday, saying he would only consider it if China again responded with raising tariffs on American goods. On Sunday, Trump seemed to express regret over the escalating trade war, which some analysts blame for signs of weakness in the U.S. and global economy. But the White House later said Trump only regretted that he didn't impose even higher tariffs on China.'The “Do It Now!” document explains in detail the rather simple way Medicare and Medicaid can replace the Affordable Care Act that is currently bankrupting the middle class coupled with a very simplified Tax Code that fulfills the highest hopes of the Founding Fathers of this great nation.

The details of the case and the court filings to date will be available to the attorney that takes the case. This case does not offer much in the way of financial rewards to me, the plaintiff, or to the legal counsel interested in getting a percent of the proceeds. What it does offer, if handled properly, is tremendous rewards to the future of the people of this great nation. The methods employed in this case to coerce the signing of a new will is not a singular event, but a widespread scourge upon our society. The actions of those who have been corrupted by mind control always indicates a widespread pattern. What makes this so difficult to be exposed is the common misunderstanding that mind control and brain washing are one in the same. They are not, they are two distinctly different processes. Though mind control often begins with goals that actually produce positive results for the victim, the goal is always to make the victim engage in activities against their will, activities that are corrupt and could be a real source of trouble to the perpetrators if the victim remembers what they have done. This is where brain washing is used to prevent the victim from being aware of the corrupt activities, they have engaged in. The brain washing process involves extreme pain so that if the subject comes up, the victim will vehemently retaliate against even the mention of the subject as they have been programmed to remember the pain, rather than the event itself. In the big picture, the primary target for corruption is the government, to bring the government down and discard the greatest document ever written, the United States Constitution. But programming has penetrated the family circle and one of the main goals at this level is to divert the family estate, regardless of the size, to a family member fully under the control of programmers. By design, programming has taken on a life of its own in families across the country, being passed down from parents to children. Victims require continuous programming to maintain control of them and one of the most diabolical achievements by China, not by the CIA who are all victims of programming themselves, is the fact that husband and wife program each other on a regular basis maintaining programming control of each other and passing the process on, to their children.My two sisters named in the case, were two of the most wonderful people I have ever known when we were children. I never heard it said that my uncle, Kenneth Conner was CIA, or that he was a programmer for the MK Ultra Program perpetrated by the CIA. In fact, I had never heard of the CIA’s MK Ultra program until I read the book, Trance Formation of America by Cathy O’Brien. But after reading the book I knew that this was what my sisters had been put through and that they had passed it down to their children. I know that they have suffered immensely over years. My mother and my sisters engaged in many fights with my uncle when this was beginning back in the sixties. My uncle died about six months after my mother and I don’t expect to prove that he was a programmer for the CIA, that should not be necessary to prove that programming was the form of coercion used on my mother to get her to change her will. It will require an extensive and expensive investigation that will begin in, and around Mercer County but will go up and down the east coast from Morgantown WV to Richmond VA to Chattanooga TN and down to Miami FL.This sort of programming has gone on far to long and now that many of the people most responsible for it have passed away the time is right to put this form of coercion on trial in a county circuit court, to start at the bottom to begin to expose the extent to which this CIA Project has corrupted our once great society. This may be the only way to make our elected officials at the federal level come to grips with this issue. It is time for the people of this country to engage our leaders to make meaningful changes to the way things are done that preserves and strengthens our Constitution and restores the power in Washington to our elected officials. My sisters have suffered enough and will not live as long as our mother who was 93 when she died, if they continue to be exposed to the extreme pressure of being programmed to do things against their will and the extreme pain they experience when their handlers decide that they should be brain washed of the memory of a crime they were programmed to commit.I do have a game plan for bringing the truth out in court that will rely heavily on the thoroughness of the investigation to uncover the crimes associated with this case. I can make available the transcripts of the two cases that have been heard, along with all papers filed, via email, to the attorney that takes the case.Religious leaders must acknowledge that the true source of Christianity is not the King James version of the Bible, the Vatican Archives in Rome are the true source. The Bible is not some magical book whose message cannot be altered by different interpretations, the Kign James version is the result of the agenda of a monarchy that was very deeply compromised by China. The authors of the original manuscripts were not the infoulable inspirations from God. The origins of the Judeo-Christian-Muslim faiths were not based on supernatural, Zeus-type creaters. Although vertually all of the tribes of man from ancient times upto the more recent tribes, including the native American tribes, had their creation stories, all of them recognized that they were just that, stories. Virtually all religious origins were grounded in the worship of nature and a powerful commitment to understand the natural world and discover the truth about our origins. Like Sitting Bull, Moses recognized that the people of the tribes of man were being confronted by an enemy that could destroy them if they could not find a way to unite themselves against this enemy. The leaders of the tribes of man agreed that they must unite and that the many different creation stories were a divisive factor. The creation story depicting the devil as the one tempting mankind to eat from the tree of knowledge is actually a role-reversal of the true story. It is mans nature, God, mans natural drive and inclination to seek knowledge and it is the devil that was seeking to prevent man from discovering his true origins and to prevent him from uniting against the real world problems. God encourages man to seek the truth. The devil, China, has a vested interest in preventing man from gaining knowledge and being able to unite against the worlds only real enemy again. The last time this ocurred “THE GATHERING STORM”Winston Churchill’s Book (updated 8/13/2019)   The reason the debt is so high? The U.S. is at war — with itself.By Charles Lane, Opinion, 7/2/2019Represented as a line graph, historical statistics on the public debt of the United States look like a jagged mountain range. There are peaks where the debt grew to pay for each of the nation’s wars or international conflicts, from the fight for independence to the late Cold War arms race under President Ronald Reagan. The subsequent peace dividends appear as debt-decline valleys. Major increases also occur during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of 2008-2009.What accounts for the current ramp-up in the debt, at a time of relative peace and steady if unspectacular economic expansion? On June 25, the Congressional Budget Office reported that, under the most politically realistic forecast, the debt will hit 105 percent of gross domestic product by 2029, a level not seen since World War II. Obviously, federal spending exceeds revenue, as it has every fiscal year since 2002. On a deeper level, though, the explanation is that the United States is at war — with itself. It is manifestly not a shooting war such as the one between 1861 and 1865, which drove the federal debt to a then-record of just over 30 percent of GDP. Yet polarized and mutually distrustful Republicans and Democrats are engaged in a Cold Civil War, and have been for years, even before the Trump presidency. The impasse has rendered impossible the compromises and trade-offs — tax increases and spending cuts, or some combination thereof — needed to adjust the existing array of government programs to modern priorities, and to available national resources. Two such deals in centrism’s last heyday, the 1990s, helped create a balanced budget from fiscal 1998 through fiscal 2001, the first and only ones of the past half-century.In more recent years, however, politicians keep the government more or less going via short-term deals (usually increasing outlays on existing programs and priorities) and borrowing, borrowing, borrowing — to the tune of 42 out of every 1,000 dollars the U.S. economy will produce in the current fiscal year, according to the CBO. Who fired the first shot? Certainly, Republicans have demanded tax cuts and Democrats have protected every dollar of Medicare and Social Security, with near-equal ferocity. At the moment, however, Republicans seem especially blameworthy; following President Trump’s lead, they used their 2017-2018 majority in Congress to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade, while boosting defense spending and abandoning their supposed interest in entitlement reform. Republicans claimed, as usual, that tax cuts would produce enough new economic growth to offset increased debt. The CBO says that hasn’t happened and probably won’t, but the combination of higher spending and lower taxes over the past year has goosed the economy, so Americans aren’t inclined to worry about deficits. A January Pew Research Center survey found that 48 percent of Americans said reducing the federal deficit should be a top policy priority, down from 72 percent in 2013, at the start of President Barack Obama’s second term. The decline was slightly greater among Republicans. No wonder the Democratic candidates to replace Trump feel justified in proposing huge new tax increases and huge new programs on which to spend them, ignoring deficit reduction. The CBO’s latest deficit projections did not even come up at their debates last week. The “budget constraint” — economic jargon for the need to fit spending priorities within limited resources — has become a non-factor in American government and politics. Unless and until some outside force reimposes it, the budget constraint may not come back. Once upon a time, fear of “bond market vigilantes,” who might stop buying Uncle Sam’s IOUs without crippling interest-rate hikes, kept tax-cutters and free-spenders in check. The CBO report duly warns that the nation’s debt path may “increase the risk of a . . . situation in which the interest rate on federal debt rises abruptly because investors have lost confidence in the U.S. government’s fiscal position.” Current reality, though, is that the global financial markets are swimming in savings and that foreign investors are eager to buy Treasurys, seeing them as a less risky alternative to other investments, according to a June 13 Wall Street Journal report. Foreign holdings of U.S. debt have grown from $1 trillion to $6 trillion over the past two decades, even though purchases by the biggest holders, Japan and China, have started to level off. Maybe the United States now exports financial safety the way other countries export cars. Wealthy people in emerging markets get their BMWs from Germany — and their “money good” promises-to-pay from the Treasury Department. If we can get away with funding our government this way, why not? A less upbeat interpretation, however, is that foreign financing is enabling the United States to indulge its penchant for dysfunctional political warfare, leaving the federal government committed to old, suboptimal policies and, over time, undermining the stability and rule of law that make this country a financial haven in the first place. There’s just no getting around it. “You’ve got to take it on faith.”Lord knows, I hope you understand. “You’ve got to take it to the limit.” Anything that is done in retribution must be viewed as evidence that they do not support our form of government and we must increase our resolve to be “The Rock”. Religious leaders must petition the Pope for access to the Vatican Archives in Rome if they wish to truly understand what Christianity is all about and how it was altered. (The problem is, if there is no time to debate it, there certainly is no time to petition the Vatican and actually get permission. “You’ve got to take it on faith” that I am telling the truth and that the Catholic nun was teaching her students the truth as related to her by a Catholic priest that studied world history as it is recorded in the Vatican Archives.) It is time for the truth seekers to join forces and announce, Mueller not exonerated; for his role in the cover-up of the crimes committed by the Bush family on 9/11/2001. It is time for the Bush boys to speak the truth to the American people. It's all about revealing the truth and helping President Donald Trump restore the power in Washington to those that have been elected and wrench it away from the secretive bureaucracy. The truth about Christianity is that it is first and foremost, a commitment to the relentless pursuit of the truth. “Three Big US Churches in Turmoil over Sex Abuse, LGBT Policy” By David Crary, AP, no date available. Stephen Schneck, Catholic University political science professor. The Rev. Adam Hamilton, The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas. And the central office of the Southern Baptist Church.All of these churches, including the source of Christianity, the Catholic Church, have been led astray. All religions of the Judeo-Christian Muslim tradition have had to kowtow to the power that the Chinese have wielded in the world by speaking of God as a supernatural being that created the heavens and the earth. But the time has come for speaking the truth. Religion was originally the worship of nature and continued to be until China was able to force its’ will upon the world. In the beginning, all of the different areas where people were living, the people of that area had their own creation story, of which, the creation story of the people of Moses was only one. Moses respected the fact that other people had their own creation stories but Moses recognized that all the different groups of people that worshipped nature had a great deal in common with each other, they all understood that they’re creation story was just a story, passed down throughout the ages but they were all seeking to know the truth and understand God, (nature) as well as they could. But Moses also understood that a powerful governing body of the far east was a growing threat to all who were seeking the truth about their origins and the numerous creation stories were a divisive factor that would prevent them from being able to act as a united force when faced with a military assault. It was not that Moses believed that their creation story was the one true creation story because the people of Moses still studied nature, to know the truth about how God’s power worked. The study of nature has always been the study of God. Science is the study of God. The study of God tells us that the most plausible creation story is evolution. The scientists of the Illuminati were not hiding from the Catholic Church just outside the Vatican. The Catholic Church was hiding the scientists and protecting them from the Chinese. The Catholic Church was not opposed to the Knights Templar, but they made it seem as though they were to protect them from the Chinese. When the Chinese discovered the identities of the Knights Templar, they dressed men in the tunics of the Crusaders and slaughtered them. To all who witnessed the assassinations, it was believed that it was done by the Catholic Crusaders. (Such is the record of history, as recorded in the Vatican Archives.) The three big churches of the US must stand firmly against LBGT because it goes in the face of nature, it is an abomination of nature, an abomination in the eyes of God. Anything that is an abomination of nature is an abomination of God. The Catholic nun who taught me these things studied under a Catholic priest who studied in the Vatican archives. It is time to face the truth, God is not some supernatural, Zeus figure that molded man from clay, God is nature. The devil is not some supernatural being that causes men to sin, the devil is the ruling class of China that has sought to gain complete and total control of the world through the use of programming for over ten thousand years. The last time the world got together to drive the Chinese from their midst, they drove them back into southeast Asia and built the great wall of China to contain them. It’s true, the Chinese did not build the great wall for defense against outside invaders, the people of the Mideast built the great wall to prevent the Chinese from getting out. The mistake they made was allowing them access to the Pacific Ocean where they became the worlds’ greatest maritime power and began to operate in secrecy by infiltrating and promoting the use of secrecy in government to gain power in other governments. Centralizing and secrecy are the key elements of Chinas’ unprecedented ability to infiltrate and undermine the primary form of government that the Chinese see as their most feared enemy, Democracy. The single greatest  Chinese coup has been, “The Art of War” by Sun Tzu. In many ways the Chinese are more powerful in the world than they have ever been, but in some very significant ways they are much weaker at their core than they have been in ages. Yes, China has always been weak at its core, because it is rotten to the core. What this means is that even the people at the heart of China hate it. But China continues to exploit the ways that it got the scholars of King James to misinterpret the Bible, keeping millions of the faithful in check. Jesus Christ is not going to return from the grave. Millions of the dead are not going to rise from their graves. As long as Christian leaders teach their followers to believe in things that never have happened and never will then they are doing the devils bidding by not dealing with the real world. The writings in the Vatican Archives do not support these teachings. The devil is real, the dragon has gone by many different names and altered the truth about many times. Today the devil goes by the name of the Communist Party of China. As long as Christian leaders teach of supernatural origins and supernatural solutions, China will grow stronger. There will be no miracles performed that solves the worlds’ problems, but it would be nothing short of a miracle for Christian leaders to face the truth and teach the truth. The truth is that the origin of all religion is the worship of nature and the awesome way in which nature can provide for man to thrive, not just survive, but thrive. The truth is that the theory of evolution gave China a mighty scare and their response has been devastating to the world’s ability to even provide the basic needs of most of its population. The outcome is not set in stone, the outcome will come down to whether China can continue to keep the faithful in check waiting for a miracle, in which case, China will win, and all forms of religion and democracy will vanish, or whether the faithful can face the truth and take the appropriate actions. Jesus Christ taught us what the most important appropriate action is, forgiveness. Forgiveness in the twenty-first century is immunity for crimes committed while under the influence of China’s programmers. Were exorcisms actually performed? Yes! Were demons exorcised from those who were possessed? No! That is what China would have us believe. These people were deprogrammed and were then capable of living uncorrupted lives. Was it some religious miracle? No. It was mainly separating them from their programmers long enough for them to snap out of it on their own. But the difficulty then, was keeping them out of the hands of their programmers. Forgiveness of our elected officials for crimes they have committed while being compromised by our intelligence community and granting them immunity from these crimes can give them the courage to fire all 2.2 million unelected federal employees if we organize the peaceful resistance prescribed in this document. What is perfectly clear after 2 ½  years of presenting this to county officials and rights organizers is that, despite the incredible benefit to the county, county officials have already been convinced that the elected officials in Washington can provide better for all 325 million Americans than they could for the population of their county. This is why it is essential that Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders step up to the plate and face the truth. China is the devil. China has always been the devil. The battle we face with corruption in this country is with the programming that originated in China.China’s deeply rooted weakness will become apparent when people stand together in peaceful unity for the end of secrecy in government. This will lead quickly to the end of corruption in government. The ability for the federal government to steal billions of dollars every year is what our current financial system was set up to do. China will be patient. Patience has always been China’s greatest ally. China knows that all it has to do is prevent the United States from getting its house in order until one of three things happens. They have turned up the heat on all three of these things, with great success, since the start of the new millennium. Driving up US debt and stealing US technology promises to bring an early end to this struggle. Driving up the US national debt is weakening our ability to defend ourselves against an aggressive China and stealing our technology and putting it into production at an astonishing rate is making it increasingly more likely that China will attempt to finish us off within the coming decade. If these two tactics fail to allow them to become militarily aggressive in pursuing their goals within the next decade, they remain confident and patient that the third tactic, the chaos caused by the over population of the earth will be coming  within the next thirty or forty years. I am not an organizer of this movement with a vast number of followers to call upon. My greatest qualification for voicing my thoughts on these subjects is not a PHD in political science or economics. My greatest qualification is the fact that I do not suffer from information overload. What little information I have been fortunate enough to acquire, I have pondered on for decades. I have given great credit to two teachers, that taught with such great passion that what they taught stayed with me forty and fifty years. I have mentioned some things my father taught me, though he died when I was only four years old. My mother is responsible for teaching me the most important things that have enabled me to analyze the big picture with confidence and clarity. One of the things that she taught me is the reason I chose to alter the words of “My Church”  by Maren Morris from Holy Ghost to Holy Spirit. My mother taught me that the Holy Ghost is the keeper of the archives of your mind and that the Holy Spirit is what makes you shiver and shake when you feel the presence of God. My mother taught me that just because you cannot solve a problem immediately it does not mean that the you won’t some-day experience an “Aha!” moment, as I certainly did during my mothers’ funeral. She taught me that even though I may have verbally acknowledged that I had given up on finding the solution, it does not mean that the Holy Ghost has given up on finding the solution. The Holy Spirit made its presence felt far more frequently in ancient times before man had been put through Chinas’ psychology of destroying the human spirit and the very will to survive. The feeling that a person is still alive after their death happens with those whom we have learned a great deal about, how they lived and how they thought, but most often it happens with someone you have known and loved deeply in life. It is the feeling that you can walk with and talk with someone that is deceased. In ancient times these feelings were so strong that many people believed that there must be an afterlife. This is what led the Catholic Church to designate some of the deceased as Saints, because their lives had such a great effect on the people that new them that many people, not just close friends and family, continued to be deeply affected by them even after their death. Many today, still get so familiar with the words of Jesus from the Bible that his way of listening and then stalling to more deeply understand the ramifications of his response, before speaking and when he spoke, he spoke so carefully and thoughtfully that his words still affect people so deeply. Even today many become so familiar with how he thought that when they ask for his help, they feel he speaks to them. This is why I believe WWJD seemed so powerful when it was very popular. Many Holy Spirits can live in your personal “Temple of God”. The human mind is the most extraordinary result of nature and all children born have far greater potential for analyzing information than any human being to date, including Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein was not an anomaly. Albert Einstein was typical, but he was being taught rocket science before most children begin attending school. You have no idea how quickly the horrifying situation we find ourselves in today that is destroying peoples’ lives and making them miserable can be turned around. But to find out, we must begin. I would like to perform some miracles in the desert, but they will strictly be miracles of engineering that will bring Africa to democracy without firing a shot. We must first avoid the pending catastrophe that will be caused by the dropping water levels in the vast aquafer beneath the Sahara. This will certainly drive up the temperatures, increasing the devastating power of hurricanes that enter the Gulf of Mexico or strike the east coast exponentially. This can be averted by ending the evaporation problem by shutting off the water and installing underground piping right up to the point of use for irrigation.   “Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.”George Washington “Assessing how to be in the best position to overcome a future challenge”. IN GOD WE TRUSTQuote from “The Greatest Generation” by Tom Brokaw“Mr. Brokaw, watch my generation now, just watch us.”“ I believe the United States of America is exceptional and inspired. I also believe that after 240 years we have an obligation on our watch to provide diligent stewardship. We must pass our country to the future generations better than ever.” “…we have a responsibility as citizens to engage in the management of our government,” Jason Chaffetz “The Deep State”“As the form of government closest to the people, counties offer a unique perspective that makes them critical players in decisions affecting their citizens and as state and local governments evolve, counties will continue to play a prominent role.” South Dakota Association of County Commissioners. Perhaps, what is printed on the back of President Ron Watson of the Harrison County Commission’s business card will be a suitable oath of office for all county commissioners. “I am committed to a government that is open, responsive and accountable to the citizens of Harrison County.” James Madison said: “Debts and taxes are the known instrument for bringing the many under the domination of the few” and “I go on the principle that a public debt is a public curse.” Thomas Jefferson spoke to the dangers of a government drunk on out-of-control spending that leads to increasing debt: “To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.” Cal Thomas in “Drowning in Debt” 2/13/2018: “the budget bill; … is expected to increase the debt to $30 trillion over the next decade,”.“THE REASON TO REFORM DEMOCRACY is to make government more effective and make the state better equipped to address the economic headwinds undermining the global economy.”                                                                       “This emerging backdrop underscores the urgency of getting the economic and political approach right.”                                                                                                  “TO BE CERTAIN, THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS of democratic capitalism are unmistakable. It has proven itself, historically, to be a peerless tool for growth…”Quotes from “Edge of Chaos” by Dambisa Moyo.                          Decentralizing the Administrative State Teachings of a university professor 40-years ago:The goal of “Decentralizing the Administrative State” is for the federal and state governments to be relieved of the bloated expense of administering programs and services that can be administered more efficiently by the county. According to the article by Damian Paletta and John Wagner “Trump sees a way forward: Shutting IT Down” … “The last government shutdown, in 2013 when Republicans controlled Congress, lasted more than two weeks. During that partial shutdown, the Obama administration said that at one point 850,000 federal employees were placed on furlough or leave without pay. … “Many lawmakers from both parties agree that the way the government funds its operations is broken and does not allow agencies to plan or prioritize. But the stopgap system has remained in place because lawmakers have a hard time agreeing on spending levels for different programs. Steve Bell, a republican former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, said Trump’s call to shut down the government over the problem was merited and could lead to a breakthrough.    ‘I don’t know anything other than a really dramatic statement that could fix this,’ he said.”This article points out how important it is that the White House and Congress shed the responsibility of funding these programs so that funding for what remains, is approved six months before the start of the fiscal year and covers an entire year. It would be advantageous to have the president present a four-year spending plan, during the first year of each term. In fact, if we accomplish this full package, the federal government will be streamlined enough that large portions of the presidents’ four-year plan will be more easily approved by congress, requiring only minor tweaks annually. This strategy that I propose, was taught to me 40 years ago by a professor at West Virginia University based on the writings of the geniuses of governing that were our Founding Fathers. Many of the Founding Fathers were of the mind that counties should be the smallest form of government and the most involved in the governing of the people. This was recognized as the most efficient way to govern, and therefore, the most effective way to avoid excessive debt. The sparse population of many counties was the reasoning for the allowance of municipalities. The need to provide for a strong military was the reason for a strong central government. There are still some sparsely populated counties but the combined strength of the counties in each state, together with our technological abilities makes this a non-issue. By making counties the smallest governing entity and allowing them to impose a 15% income tax on all residents of the county, I put forth, that the counties will be able to provide all services required by the people. Furthermore, our military is the strongest in the world and the federal government will become much stronger when the White House and Congress are able to focus a great deal more of their attention on The World Trade Organization, The United Nations, The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, The Organization of American States and The World Court, et al. -Wikipedia- The mission of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. The 34 OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Personally, I like this roster, the US should throw the WTO under the bus and concentrate on the OECD. To be guided by the writings of the Founding Fathers, who were most concerned with avoiding unsustainable debt and the people maintaining their individuality and free will, calls for the federal government to be responsible for governing the states without infringing on the states’ constitutions, and the business entities that the federal government taxes, among other governing responsibilities that are many. The federal government must also govern itself, and the people must make their voices heard, in how the federal government governs itself. This is accomplished by the people insisting that their elected officials present bills and vote on bills according to the needs of their constituents, or they will not be re-elected. This is happening on an unprecedented scale now, in the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The document before you offer county officials a rallying point, to call for greater autonomy of county government. Unite the county into a single tax base and claim sovereignty over personal income tax of county residents to supply the resources necessary for county government to relieve the federal government of the incredibly complicated, and ridiculously expensive responsibility of providing services to 321.4 million (2015 census) people from Washington.This is the way to achieve the president’s goal of reducing corporate taxes to 15% while paying down billions on the national debt by the end of the year, and trillions every year after that. The idea is for the county to be the only form of government making laws that directly affect the people, directly policing the people, or taxing the peoples’ income. That the state enacts laws that only govern the businesses they tax and the counties, (not the people). That the state be the only form of government taxing businesses income headquartered in the state and that are licensed to do business in no more than four other states and taxing counties with a surplus more than $1,150,000.00/year at a rate of 15%. That the federal government enact laws only governing the states, (not the counties nor the people), the businesses the federal government taxes and the military. That our federal government be the only form of government in the US taxing businesses income headquartered in the United States and doing business in more than five states and international corporations head quartered in the US and taxing states with a surplus more than $1,150,000.00/year at a rate of 15% and taxing the other international corporations that only sell products to US businesses or directly to citizens in the United States with a 15% across the board tariff. No favoritism, no punishment, simply a 15% tariff on all products entering the US.Making the changes of turning over the responsibility for administering and funding of federal programs to the counties is smart business. President Donald Trump is a business man elected to make the government more business-like. Effectively delegating authority is the key ingredient for a large corporation to continue to be successful. Delegation is about giving employees the responsibility, authority and resources to make decisions and carry them out. Effective delegation will allow the president and Congress more time to work on, what have become extremely important and difficult problems. The world is in crisis. Our Founding Fathers provided the blueprints for counties to be the smallest governing entity and to be the only governing entity allowed to collect income tax from the people. Being the smallest governing entity makes them of adequate size that the population can generate enough resources to provide all services required by the people. These proposals are intended to strengthen the federal government, not weaken it. The federal government is becoming weaker because of excessive debt, caused by excessive responsibilities to administer services to the people. The only employee’s necessary to administer these services already work in the counties, but hundreds of thousands of unnecessary employees are required to administer them from Washington. Recognizing that these changes can achieve the president’s goal of reducing corporate taxes to 15% while paying down billions on the national debt by the end of this year, and trillions every year after, should be more than enough incentive to begin overcoming the naysayers and get this started in all counties. Due to the shock to the economy from the tax relief at every level, most of all to the people in cities, the benefits will pour down, not trickle. Certainly, city mayors will be the most likely ones to balk at this move but even they will have to admit that the people of the city would be relieved of an immense combined tax burden from the city, county, state and federal governments to pay only 15% income tax to the county. The mayor would, in fact, have a much larger budget to work with as the commissioner of the primary district in, what was the city or as mayor of the county; (I propose that all states adopt the form of county government used in Hawaii where there are no governing bodies smaller than the county and they elect a county mayor and further that the boundary of each city or town that presently has a mayor be the boundary of a district, or of several districts, named for the city.) It is important that the small towns continue to grow and retain their identity. These changes will result in the County Commission being a full-time job in places it is not already because of a greater work load, and require much higher pay and responsibility, but the county will have a much, much larger budget to work with in all cases. Analysis of this needs to be done by county and state government. A single congressman can request analysis by the Congressional Research Service for the federal government, the CRS has access to the same data as the Congressional Budget Office but doesn’t carry the weight of the CBO score. Turning over this responsibility to counties and having county governments adopt the form of governing used in Hawaii may be able to be initiated by “Executive Order” to the state governors, citing the intent of the Founding Fathers and the dire need of solving the    $22,362,000,000,000.00 (Twenty-Two Trillion Three Hundred & Sixty-Two Billion Dollars) NATIONAL DEBT that costs tax payers $255.5 billion/yr. in interest or a mind boggling $700 million/day. (Visit “National Debt Clock Real Time” 6/9/2019 and rising). This is a win-win-win-win situation. The people living in cities that pay all kinds of taxes to the city, county, state and federal governments will pay one tax of 15% to the county, what a boost to the economy. Ninety percent of counties will have millions in surplus when they send out their first tax returns. All states should do very well with less responsibility and taxing businesses head quartered in the state and doing business in no more than 4 other states and counties with an annual surplus of more than $1,150,000.00 at 15%. The federal government should be the biggest winner of all shedding more than 2,000,000 federal employees in Washington, in counties across the country and starting fresh with new embassies around the world. The people in the counties will be working for the counties but the ones that lose their jobs in Washington should be well taken care of, those with 25 years or more should receive full retirement and the rest should receive, either a partial retirement or a generous severance pay. All should be encouraged to go into business for themselves or join the National Guard (more on the new National Guard later). All federal employees will be fired and those receiving retirement will not receive Social Security, that’s over for retirees receiving more than $50,000.00/year from other sources. The 15% Personal Income Tax collected by the County:Those who earn less than $15,000.00/year will get a full refund in October, one year and a half after filing in April. This year and a half lag will make it much easier to get this massive project off the ground and make it easier for the county commission to budget the money in the future. The tax table will increase 1%/thousand between 15 and $30,000.00. One earning $22,000.00 will pay $3,300.00 in tax and receive a $2,250.00 refund. The $15,000.00 deduction will phase out between $100,000.00/year and $115,000.00/year at 1%/$1,000.00. Married couples with, one or more children, with a single income will be taxed as if it were two incomes. Single parents of children living in the home or attending college up to the age of 26 will be taxed the same as a married couple with a single income, as if it were two incomes. No further deduction for dependent children should be necessary, but that will be left to the discretion of the counties. Minimum wage for 14 and 15-year old’s, working on a work-permit will be $7.50/hour, for 16 and 17-year old’s, minimum wage will be $10.00/hour, minimum wage for adults between 18 and 21 will be $12.50/hour, for adults over 21 minimum wage will be $15.00/hour. All counties will have a minimum raise scale of .50c/6mon. Tips will not be taxed. Minimum corporate salary will be $60,000.00/year, based on a 60-hour work week this is less than a $5.00/hour raise over $15.00/hour. Minimum raise scale for salary earners will be $2,000.00/yr. The answer to all budget issues on every level is getting people back to work in the private sector at a taxable income. The beauty of a $15.00/hour minimum wage is, it is a gross income of roughly $31,200.00/year for 40 hours/week, 52 weeks/year. Minimum salary for county employees would start at $30,000.00/year tax free and would increase $1000.00/year, such as teachers in the county. This would mean teachers with 10 years teaching in Barbour County would be making $40,000.00/year and 20 years, $50,000.00/year tax free. Teachers with a doctorate would start at $40,000.00/year tax free and 35 years-experience would bring their pay to $75,000.00/year.Belington, Junior and Philippi would join with the rest of the people of Barbour County to become a single municipality with one mayor, the mayor of Barbour County. There will be at least three additional county commissioners in Barbour County. The county commissioners of the District of Belington, the District of Junior and the District of Philippi. The Mayor of Barbour County will not be a commissioner as the presidents of WV counties currently are. Barbour County should play a leading role in this effort by determining how much income, the 15% income tax described above would generate and calling upon the teachers, who are already motivated by years of low pay, to take this message to the people. County Officials will find that this single tax will cover everything lain out for the county to take care of, with a substantial surplus. Why? Because, if it is done with a full and open accounting by the Barbour County Commission there will be virtually no outrageous losses due to inefficiency and corruption, excuse me for saying there is corruption in federal government, that’s not “politically correct”, I should have said, “misappropriation of funds” or “improper payments”. It’s not a lie, it’s just “politically correct”. The potential for efficient and effective use of the substantial available revenue by the County Commission working with the private and religious aid agencies in Barbour County to provide the needs of the people is enormous and is something the federal government is totally incapable of. “The spending issues, ranging from Medicare and Medicaid mismanagement to transportation programs to weapon systems acquisitions, cost taxpayers $125 billion in improper payments in 2014 alone, as highlighted in a new report from the Government Accountability Office.” By Kellan Howell - The Washington Times - Thursday, March 5, 2015Counties will have only two sources of revenue to fund the programs and services with one exception, non-residents that own property they rent-out or don’t use, or a vacation home they use only a couple of weeks, to a month per year in the county, will be the only property owners required to pay property tax, because they benefit from the services provided, while paying their income tax elsewhere. People who live in West Virginia for 7 months and Florida for 5 months will be required to break down their income tax accordingly. Everyone that earns a pay check, regardless of where they work, will pay 10% for Social Security and 15% income tax to the county in which they reside for the services provided to them and to share the costs of providing for others in the county. Counties will be required to find ways to budget their money to insure they have a minimum surplus of $1000.00 annually, to maintain a growing rainy-day fund. When the rainy-day fund exceeds 1 billion dollars the top of the agenda each time the county commission meets will be to create jobs for the unemployed people of the county. When the rainy-day fund exceeds one trillion dollars it will simply be a reason for a state-wide celebration. Of course, this kind of reserve will allow the county great latitude to do things that are not required of it, such as reaching out to other counties that are struggling to pull them along by stimulating growth in surrounding counties it will “lift all boats” in their own county, this sort of interaction will allow the state rainy-day fund to grow to be better prepared for a state-wide disaster. When a shortage of funds is an issue it may be solved by calling on local churches and aid organizations to pick up the slack, or in some cases, for them to take care of some needs permanently, so the programs the county cannot afford can be discontinued. The county can interact directly Heart and Hand, Health Access and local pharmacies, doctors and hospitals to bring costs in ways the federal government cannot. Having said that, the main objective for counties should be prompt payment of medical bills. Negotiations should be for the long term at least a year in advance so that bills can be paid the first of the month after the county receives them without question. A further goal of county run health insurance that has been very lucrative, generating a fat surplus, should be to have hospitals send all of a patients medical bills to them, including those that are the result a car accident or any case that may be covered by another form of insurance so that if the bill is not paid within 30 days the county would pay it the first of the following month and bill the insurer deemed responsible at a 10% mark-up. This will relieve individuals of the burden and worry while trying to recover and a successful county will be in a better position to make one of the insurers pay-up than an individual is. Social Security will be used for one and only one reason, retirement, all other programs currently funded by Social Security will either be funded by the 15% income tax or discontinued. Funding the start-up by the state and federal government:            The governor will look at the money budgeted for the Board of Education for the coming fiscal year and break it down county by county determining how much they spent in each and send them a check for how much was spent in their county last fiscal year adjusted in accordance with the amount budgeted for the next fiscal year and the county commission will deposit it in a Board of Education account. State Road will do the same, retaining control over what is needed to maintain the interstate highway system. Regional Jails will be owned and operated by the county in which they are located and will be the location of the county home confinement monitoring facility. Recovering addicts will be the only inmates held here, housing and immigrants caught sneaking across a national border or refugees who have friends or relatives in the county will be vetted here.  All other state services that the governor determines can be run more efficiently by the county will be handled the same way. The state and federal government will provide payroll information for the previous year. Since 2019 will be the last year of funding these programs, rather than reducing funding, the president and Congress should boost it. The President will have the Congressional Budget Office determine how much was spent in each county last year by the Department of Health and Human Services, and issue a check based on the budget for the coming fiscal year to each county to be deposited in a county DHHS account. The county commission will spread these accounts around to the different banks in the county until a County Credit Union (details to be worked out by each county commission that will be afforded this right within the guidelines of state and federal regulations and laws) can be opened in an existing building or built. CCU Rules: Only residents of the county will be able to be members of the County Credit Union i.e. owners, but anyone will be able to open a savings account there to keep their savings FDIC protected or just to take advantage of a higher interest rate i.e. better managed CCU mutual fund. The County Credit Union will be allowed to start its own mutual fund with the CCU assets above the minimum cash holdings required by state and federal law. County residents with a savings account i.e. members savings accounts interest rate will be based on a percentage of the annual gain of the CCU-MF of the previous year ending one month before. Example: Interest rate month of June based on CCU-MF earnings May to April of previous year. Non-member deposit interest rate 80% of the member rate. Members and non-members FDIC protected up to $250,000.00 per 2018 rate. If “We the People” ever stand together and stop the bus from repeatedly running over us. Think: Anthony Borges. Think about what this young man did alone, in the face of near certain death. We must find the courage to stand together in county court yards across the country determined to prevent violence with the assistance of the fire department and rescue squad personnel and working closely with the county sheriff’s department. WHO IS ANTHONY BORGES? HEROIC TEEN SHOT FIVE TIMES SHIELDING FRIENDS FROM FLORIDA GUNMAN BY HARRIET SINCLAIR ON 2/19/18 Funding county-run Social Security accounts:The federal government will advertise in every newspaper across the country, the total amount in the Social Security account, the total population of the country, the total population of each state, and the population of each county and the total number of retired people drawing a retirement check in each county. So, everyone will see that the numbers add-up and the money in Social Security is being distributed to the 3,144 counties in a fair and equitable way. Ten percent of what is allotted to the state will be deposited in a state Social Security account and 10% of what counties collect will be paid to the state account to assist counties that do not take in enough to cover their retirees. Each county will deposit their check in a Social Security account, 10% of residents’ income will be paid into this account. The amount each person pays into this account will be tracked to determine how much they qualify to receive when they retire. The minimum monthly amount paid to retirees will be increased to $1000.00/mon. after age, 65, whether you paid into it or not, and the maximum amount anyone can receive will be $3000.00/mon. No tax will be paid on Social Security income, even though the maximum is $36,000.00/yr. When taxing retirees, their income from Social Security will not be counted. This means retirees can make $15,000.00 from a part-time job or in dividends and get a full refund or pay no tax on that income. Gains on money in the stock market, other than dividends, will be taxed only when the stock is sold. Retirees that sell “all” of their stock, will be taxed only for the amount more than $1,000,000.00. Not everyone that pays into Social Security will be eligible to receive a SS check. Those that have a retirement plan that pays them more than $50,000.00/year or those that have stock and savings that exceed one million dollars in value will not be able to receive a SS check. Those that have less than one million dollars in stock and savings and has a retirement plan that pays less than $50,000.00/year will be eligible to receive a SS check that boosts their monthly retirement income to $50,000.00/year or the maximum, $36,000.00/year.                  For counties that are going in the hole the state will build recycling plants that recycle paper and melt down glass, plastics and metals for reuse. Canning jar plants that use recycled glass for the jars, that are a standard quart size and recycled metal for the lids big enough to get your hand in. And a food cannery that cans food in the quart jars made next door. If only one county requires this assistance, the three plants will be designed to handle the needs of the entire state, based on 100% recycling. All counties should be working toward having their own recycling plants that separates, reuses or melts down the materials for reuse, with the goal of mining old dumps when 100% recycling is achieved. The larger recycling plants funded by the state will begin recycling for surrounding states that will not be able to handle all of the recycling they require as other counties in the state begin doing their own recycling. Being able to overcome the forces of organized crime that controls Waste Management nationwide and actually get down to the business of melting down plastics, glass and metals and produce bars of cheap raw materials for reuse or resale, here in WV for Washington, Maryland and New York could be a big business.The 15% Business Tax collected by the state and the tax on counties:Counties will be relieving the state government of a great deal of expense and responsibility and the people of the counties deserves some concrete assurances for taking that on. Initially, the state will make it law that the state will tax only the businesses headquartered in the state and licensed to do business in no more than four other states (and make it clear the state will not tax the people) and that tax will not be a sales tax that the people pay. The maximum tax the state can collect from the businesses will be the same exact 15% tax described above with a $15,000.00 deduction, increasing 1%/$1000.00 between 15 and $30,000.00/year, with a one year and a half lag between filing and receiving a refund. With one exception, the $15,000.00 deduction will phase out between $85,000.00 and $100,000.00 at 1%/$1000.00. The state will require less revenue, and the 15% ceiling on the tax rate will keep prices down for consumers. The only deductions businesses can claim will be for the cost of administration salaries, labor wages, materials, rentals, utilities and fuel for transporting goods and personnel and operating equipment, shipping and handling, contract work, new construction, the purchase of land and existing structures and the purchase of new or used equipment expenses for the year with no loopholes. This is a simple, no loopholes, tax code that, not only makes it possible to calculate a maximum 100% markup on the products a business sells, but also makes it easy for anyone to go into business. All states will adopt the same tax code.  All employees on salary will be paid no less than $60,000.00/year. From management to the board of directors to the owner, everyone that is on salary, their salary can be claimed as an administration deduction up to a maximum allowable deduction of $300,000.00 each for those making more than $300,000.00/year. Even though ones’ employer can only claim a maximum deduction of $300,000.00/year for their salary, these individual’s total income will be taxed by the county in which they reside. Counties that have an annual surplus more than $1,000,000.00 will be taxed by the state, on a tax table starting at 0% for a $1,000,000.00 surplus, and increasing 1% per $10,000.00, up to a maximum of 15% on a surplus of $1,150,000.00/year. The tax money collected by the state from the counties will be set aside to be used to help the counties that are going in the hole. The concrete assurance that the state will provide to the people that the contents of this paragraph will be respected will come in the form of an amendment to the state constitution. All calls for a Convention to alter the United States Constitution must be thwarted to avoid the possibility of losing far more than what the Convention was proposed to achieve, even to the point of losing the entire United States Constitution.   The 15% Corporate Tax collected by the IRS and the tax collected from the States:The federal government will tax only the businesses, companies, or corporations licensed to do business in more than five states that are headquartered in the US and international corporations licensed to do business in the United States. International corporations and all other business entities will be required to purchase a license in each state before selling products in the state whether from a store, by catalog or on the internet. To be fair to everyone the federal tax will be a maximum of 15% with a $15,000.00 deduction, the tax table will increase 1%/thousand between 15 and $30,000.00. there will be a one year and a half lag between the time they file their taxes and when they receive their refund. The $15,000.00 deduction will be phased out between $70,000.00 and $85,000.00 at 1%/$1000.00. The only deductions businesses can claim will be for the cost of administration salaries, labor wages, materials, rentals, utilities and fuel for transporting goods and personnel and operating equipment, shipping and handling, contract work, new construction, the purchase of land and existing structures and the purchase of new or used equipment expenses for the year with no loopholes. All states and the federal government will have the same simple tax code, but they will not tax the same businesses, this is a key factor to being able to calculate the maximum markup on all businesses. All employees on salary will be paid no less than $60,000.00/year. From management to the board of directors to the owner, everyone that is paid a salary, their salary can be claimed as a deduction up to a maximum allowable deduction of $300,000.00 each for those whose salary is more than $300,000.00/year. Even though ones’ employer can only claim a maximum deduction of $300,000.00/year for their income these individuals will pay tax on all of their income to the county in which they reside. The federal government will tax states that have an annual surplus of more than $1,150,000.00/year at 15%, starting at 0% for $1,000,000.00/year surplus and increasing by 1% per $10,000.00 (Ten Thousand Dollars) of surplus per year. The tax collected from the states will be used to pay the national debt off first, then it will be used for infrastructure.If you think this is too much for the people to try to accomplish, consider this; What if the Founding Fathers had decided forming a new government was too much to do? Where would we be now? There are multiple possible answers to this question, all of which are highly debatable but most likely all possible answers would be in agreement on one point. We would probably be far less capable of being able to make any changes peacefully or successfully. We can make these changes and it can be done peacefully if county people gather peacefully in county courtyards to debate these issues and come to a consensus on just how much of this the majority of people support and call on President Donald Trump to lead the country through these changes so that we can achieve his goals of tax reform that simplifies taxes. ACA repeal and replace that fully repeals ACA regulations that have allowed private insurers to rob the middle-class blind and replaces it with this combination of Medicare and Medicaid administered by county officials that will bring great wealth to counties. The “Medicare for All” being bandied about by presidential candidates will require even more regulations than the ACA and will run the national debt and taxes up even higher. The changes called for in this document are the kind of changes that our president has said that he wants to make, and the kind of changes we elected Donald Trump to make. This kind of simplified tax code is just the sort that would appeal to Mr. Trump because it would encourage new businesses by thousands of people that know that the current tax code can cause a sole proprietor with a successful small business to lose everything because of a minor, innocent mistake that may have gone unnoticed for years that if it is caught by an audit, regardless of the fact that it was an innocent oversight, it can put you out of business and in debt for the rest of your life. This should not even be a concern for people wanting to start their own business, and it would not be possible with this simple and direct of a tax code.Argument for no loopholes: “There’s a lot to like about cutting corporate taxes” article by Noah Smith, May 5th, 2017, The Exponent Telegram, Clarksburg, WV: “…perhaps the clearest reason to cut corporate taxes is the waste they generate through avoidance. A key often overlooked fact about the U.S. corporate tax is that many businesses manage to pay little or nothing. One of the most common ways to do this is to shift profits overseas, through transfer pricing, inversions or other perfectly legal methods, to a tax haven country like the Cayman Islands. There, a company can avoid taxes indefinitely, reinvesting the profits in its business and letting them compound. If the company wants to cash out, it has to repatriate its cash and pay taxes to the U.S., but the returns from delaying the date of payment can be substantial. And often, a corporation can avoid taxes altogether by waiting for the U.S. to enact a repatriation holiday.“In addition to tax havens, there are many other legal loopholes businesses can exploit to avoid taxes. As a result of avoidance, the U.S. doesn’t collect much more than other countries do, despite having a much higher official tax rate. A number of recent studies find that, on average, U.S. companies pay about 27 percent to 30 percent of their profits in taxes, compared with 24% to 26% average for other nations. Meanwhile, because of tax avoidance, the true rate isn’t closely tied to the headline rate. The official U.S. rate has remained 35% since 1993, with only minor changes. But the percent of corporate profits collected through the tax system has fallen quite a bit. All that avoidance costs real resources – hours of labor by tax accountants and financial professionals, buildings for them to work in, and computers to keep everything in order. By cutting the corporate tax rate, the U.S. would reduce the incentive for companies to waste all that money avoiding taxes. Reducing the reward from tax avoidance might also lower an important barrier to entry in U.S. industries. Tax avoidance probably has big fixed costs – you have to hire teams of lawyers and set up foreign subsidiaries. Those fixed costs make it difficult for small startups to compete on a level playing field with big, established companies, worsening the problem of monopoly power in the economy. Cutting the rate would make the system fairer. (Maybe, but closing the loopholes and making transfer pricing, inversions, etc. illegal would, definitely do the trick). “So, although we shouldn’t expect corporate tax cuts to be a cure-all, there are a number of reasons to slash the official rate. Most advanced countries have already done this. A rate of 15% might be a bit extreme, but a cut to 30 or 25% would almost certainly be a good move.” Thank you very much Mr. Smith! But here again, 15% is doable, but only by significantly lowering expenditures by the federal government. Now we know federal government is perfectly capable and willing to brake laws requiring that lowering of taxes not increase the national debt, as the permanent 22% corporate tax will increase the national debt by trillions of dollars. As will the temporary tax reductions for the lower and middle-income families that will placate the public and make everyone ignore this truth. The federal government will charge a 15% tariff on all products coming into the country to help level the playing field, it will not be used to punish some and favor others. International Corporations with their headquarters outside the US will be required to file pay roll information for the previous year, and they must verify that they pay a minimum wage the equivalent of five US dollars per hour to receive the license and they must file the documents to verify this every year to renew their license. Just imagine what this will do for the Chinese market, and the other markets where labor is paid less than two dollars per hour. International Corporations’, with headquarters outside the US, that do no production of their products in the US, only tax paid to the US will be the 15% tariff paid to our federal government for products entering the US. International Corporations, headquartered outside the United States with manufacturing or retail stores in the US, will only claim deductions for employees working in the US and materials bought in the US for use in the US, likewise for the rest of the allowable deductions. All individuals, businesses, companies, corporations or international corporations will pay the 15% tax annually to only one of the three levels of government, federal, state or county except for owners of businesses that pay themselves a salary more than $300,000.00/year. All entities that pay their income tax to the federal government will be required to verify that their employees, board of directors and owner have paid their income tax to the county. No entity will operate tax free for any reason, not as an incentive to do business, nor as a so-called non-profit institution, nor as a so-called charity, these have been abused to the point they are the most profitable businesses and the richest tax havens in existence. The only exception will be religious groups that voluntarily provide financial records to the county and provide aid to the less fortunate in the county at a minimum of 10% of their net income when their financial records indicate they can afford to do so. The only individuals that do not pay income tax are the people that are paid with tax payer money by the county. State and federal officials and the military will pay income tax to the county or counties where they live. Contractors paid with taxpayer money, most of whom are making money from many other sources will pay tax on their total income. For the first 170 years of the history of our nation, the high integrity of our merchants, displayed by satisfaction with modest profits held inflation down. A 10% mark-up was widely held to be the maximum markup, without government involvement. During our first 170 years, the conservative integrity of merchants led the Republican Party to become staunchly against price controls. Some claim that, the lack of a gold standard causes inflation. “The gold standard is a monetary system that directly links a currency’s value to that of gold. A country on the gold standard cannot increase the amount of money in circulation without also increasing its gold reserves. Because the global gold supply grows only slowly, being on the gold standard would theoretically hold government overspending and inflation in check. … “The country effectively abandoned the gold standard in 1933, and completely severed the link between the dollar and gold in 1971.” MentalFloss. I am a man of common sense, and my common sense tells me that this theory is incorrect, inflation is more closely tied to the modest integrity of merchants and the modest integrity of those that govern, than being on the gold standard. Regardless of who is right, it is not likely we will return to the gold standard and modest integrity is difficult to find, so we must accept self-destruction by inflation or demand a reasonable price control. The insane greed of the drug companies that require that a couple pay more $20,000.00/year for health insurance to buy insulin and then the insurer refuses to pay for the ridiculously high-priced drug that the patient has found to be the only insulin drug that effective for them is not only robbing the middle-class blind but murdering them.What I propose is a price control made possible by limiting the deductions from state and federal taxes. This will produce quick results in lowering prices, but it will take time to accumulate the data necessary for accuracy. It will take more time for the IRS to examine the data to decide if the pricing meets the requirements of the law. It should also be noted that reducing the tax base of the federal government, eliminating loop-holes and simplifying taxes will result in the IRS having more time to devote to this. For this to be fair it should not target healthcare but be applied to all industries and businesses. (Something should also be done to address why there is a middleman warehouse business between pharmacies and the products they sell). Case in point: The article in today’s The Exponent Telegram, Clarksburg, WV, 4/4/2017, “Mylan subsidiary gets hit with RICO Act”. “The lawsuit targets the EpiPen list price last year of $608.62, an increase of 574% by Mylan since it got the rights to market and distribute the drug in 2007”. … “Why has the price of a product, which Mylan did not develop and costs so little to produce, gotten so out of control? EpiPen’s list price has skyrocketed because, as Mylan has admitted, it pays ‘intermediaries’ in the pharmaceutical distribution system, known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), …”. Amazing timing, “thank you”.                                    “WHY DRUGS COST SO MUCH”                                         Article by THE EDITORS OF AARP Bulletin, May 2017          “Nothing stops drug companies from charging the highest price the market will bear.                 The result: PRICES THAT MAKE LITTLE SENSE, BUT LOTS OF PROFIT”Our president is working on ways to lower the cost of bringing drugs to market and that will allow drug companies to lower prices if they are fair about it. I propose that state and federal government cap retail and wholesale markup at 100% of the cost of bringing their products to market, spreading the cost of the only deductions businesses can claim on their taxes, which are the cost of administration salaries, labor wages, materials, rentals, utilities and fuel for transporting goods and personnel and operating equipment, shipping and handling, shipping and handling, contract work, new construction, the purchase of land and existing structures and the purchase of new or used equipment expenses for the year with no loopholes across the company’s products. Because these expenses are the only deductions from gross income for the proposed 15% across the board tax on every business entity, it makes determining that prices are within the guidelines possible, which is not the case with our present tax code. Not allowing for the cost of clinical trials (where applicable) or research and development (R&D), I propose that new drugs, new technology and new products be allowed a markup of 300% the first year, 200% the second year and 150% the third year they are being sold in the market, trusting that sometimes this will be more than is needed and sometimes less but over time it will even out. And knowing full well that company’s engaging in R&D, especially pharmaceutical companies can afford it, or they wouldn’t be paying their CEO’s a median salary of $14,500,000.00 (Fourteen Point Five Million Dollars). More than any other industry. And spending $24,000,000,000.00 (Twenty-Four Billion Dollars) marketing directly to doctors and $6,400,000,000.00 (Six Point Four Billion Dollars) advertising to consumers in the U.S. annually, (per AARP article cited above). Since this is a percent increase of the cost of bringing products to market it will not be necessary to increase it because if the cost of bringing the product to market increases, the price you can sell it for increases exponentially.States will enforce the mark-up maximum of 100% detailed above:The states will be required to enforce the same 100% markup cap with the “new product” guide line and enact a state law to this effect, as described above on the businesses they tax by requiring them to verify their compliance with the law to receive a state business license each year whether the state charges for the license or not. There is, potentially, a lot more money in business licensing, let’s say we keep it at $30.00 for life for businesses netting less than $100,000.00/year here in WV, then increase it to a $1000.00/year for businesses netting between 100,000.00 and $200,000.00/year in the state, increasing it by $1,000.00/year every additional $100,000.00/year after that. The state could allow businesses to obtain their first license in the state at $30.00 as incentive, rather than having to estimate in-state profits. The free market is a wonderful thing when merchants have modest integrity, in all areas of business except one, it can bring the highest quality products at the lowest prices. The one area that this is simply not true is health insurance. Health insurance rates go down as the size of the healthy pool goes up, this means that the more insurers cutting up the healthy pool the higher the rates the insurer is forced to charge. This is being illustrated in every debate taking place in the fight to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The largest pool in any country is a single-payer or universal system. One national health insurance provider creates the largest possible pool of healthy patients available to offset the costs of the chronically ill, therefore providing the lowest rates to the people, or the government as single-payer is defined, but that is not what I am proposing because that requires increased government regulation and that is not my goal.Bill Gates, Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet all agree Medicare and Medicaid, as a universal system, are the future of health-care in the United States with private insurers providing insurance to people who believe they will be better protected with private insurance. I believe this is a fair assessment of the interview I watched, 5/9/2017, on the internet.        President Donald Trump said that Australia has “better health-care than we do” during a meeting with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “Thank You, Mr. President”“Let’s move to a Medicare for all system, that does what every other major country on earth does, guarantee health-care at a fraction of the cost per capita that we spend.”I like what Bernie Sanders said about guaranteeing health-care at a fraction of the costs, but I don’t like the way “single-payer insurance” is defined; increasing federal regulation of health-care, increasing taxes so the federal government pays all the medical bills. That’s no way to control healthcare costs or to be more fiscally responsible, that’s just a sure way to increase the national debt and increase taxes and end the free market in healthcare.Affordable healthcare combined with fiscal responsibility trumps all else. The choice is not, one or the other, it is possible to have both. When we can have both, when faced with a $22,362,000,000,000.00 (Twenty-Two Trillion Three Hundred & Sixty-Two Billion Dollars) NATIONAL DEBT. We cannot let anything stand in the way of choosing both. We cannot run this debt up any higher. At some point, soon, we will be faced with, nearly insurmountable, run-away interest. Jason Chaffetz warns us in his new book “The Deep State” that interest on the national debt is costing tax-payers an earth shattering $700,000,000.00/day. Is there anyone that can wrap their mind around Seven Hundred Million Dollars per DAY!?ACA Repeal and ReplaceMedicare, Medicaid and CHIP as a “Semi-Universal System”:Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP as a “Semi-Universal System” allowing private insurers to try to compete provides a great opportunity today. I am not proposing that Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP have exclusive rights to the healthcare market. What I am proposing will stifle private insurers only as long as it takes congress to rein in health-care costs. This strategy provides a generous price control that does not impede the free market in any other way. We can write a whole slew of laws targeting healthcare or we can accept this full package of tax code reform that facilitates an across the board, ceiling on markup. What I am proposing is that we allow Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP to compete by selling insurance by this simple formula to anyone living in the United States, regardless of immigration status. CHIP to couples wanting children but require fertility treatment, wed or unwed pregnant women and parents with children under the age of 26 starting at $50.00 (Fifty Dollars)/month and increasing $1.00/month each year. A married couple that are facing fertility issues will have to start CHIP coverage to have insurance pay 90% of those expenses, the rate will remain $50.00/month until the child is a year old. Medicaid to people from the age of 26 to 50 starting at $100.00 (One Hundred Dollars)/month and increasing $3.00/month each year. At 49, full coverage Medicaid insurance would cost $169.00/month. A married couple, both 30 years old with a 5-year old would pay $279.00/month for full coverage health-care insurance. And Medicare to people over 50 starting at $200.00 (Two Hundred Dollars)/month and increasing $5.00/month each year.  Medical conditions will not be a factor, the rates will simply be the same for all people of a specific age based on the above formula. Sell them full coverage health insurance with a 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $15,000.00, for those netting less than $100,000.00/year, on hospital bills, doctor visits, prescriptions, dental and eye care, cover every medical bill except mental health and frivolous cosmetic surgery. There must be some attempt to define the difference between necessary cosmetic surgery and frivolous. As well as, a process for clearing up any gray area on an individual case basis to avoid court action. These rates will be set for five years, at which time it will be each counties responsibility to raise or lower rates at their discretion.Regardless of pre-existing medical conditions, sell them full coverage health insurance, based on their age, with a 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $15,000.00/year for those netting less than $100,000.00/year with the same exceptions as above. This plan will provide full coverage health-care free to anyone netting less than $5,000.00 per year. Those netting between 5 and $10,000.00/year will pay the 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $100.00 per year. Those netting between 10 and $15,000.00/year will pay the 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $500.00/year. Those netting between 15 and $20,000.00/year will pay the 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $1,000.00/year. Those netting between 20 and $25,000.00/year will pay the 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $5,000.00/year and 1/3 of the above formula. Those netting between 25 and $30,000.00/year will pay the 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $10,000.00/year and 2/3 of the above formula. Everyone netting more than $30,000.00/year will pay the full amount of the above formula and the 10% co-pay with a maximum co-pay of $15,000.00/year. The amount paid into your personal healthcare account, as well as, the amount spent on your health-care will be available to you. At 26, when you switch from CHIP to Medicaid, the balance of your CHIP account will be transferred to Medicaid and at 51 when you switch from Medicaid to Medicare, the balance of your Medicaid account will be transferred to Medicare.  People netting more than $100,000.00/year will pay the full amount of the above formula with an 11% co-pay, with a maximum co-pay of $20,000.00/year. The maximum co-pay will increase by 1% and $10,000.00/year for every $100,000.00 increase in net income. Those netting between $900,000.00 and $1,000,000.00/year will pay a 20% co-pay, with a maximum co-pay of $100,000.00/year. Those netting over $1,000,000.00/year will pay the 20% co-pay with no maximum limit. The insurance, CHIP, Medicaid or Medicare will pay the rest of the bill.  Those netting more than $100,000.00/year will see an increase in their rates when their account balance is less than $1000.00 after the first five years of joining one of the two plans. This will be the only circumstances under which an individual’s health-care coverage rate will be raised above the rate everyone else pays and only if the county account is struggling, defined as, an account balance of less than $150,000,000.00 (One Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars). The amount of the increase will be determined on a case by case basis, based on the amount of their income and the amount of the projected annual expense to the plan. This is nearly double what I paid, $79.00/month at age of 37 for full-coverage health insurance in 1996, by this plan it will be $148.00/month at age of 37. I am not suggesting that Medicare and Medicaid have exclusive rights to the health care market, only that they set their rates so low that corporate or group insurers are likely to be the only ones to try to compete until the cost of medical care has been reined in, which this does. This will do away with all Affordable Care Act regulations on private insurers so private insurers can find a way to compete. They will be able to compete, but they’ll hate it because as county, state and federal Medicare and Medicaid accounts grow fat with cash, it will become clear as a bell that private insurers were using the ACA to cut the middle-class off at their knee caps while squandering a fortune in federal subsidies as they pulled every trick in the embezzlement book to secret fortunes away from the state and federally regulated accounts and stuff the pockets of the democrats for enacting it and the republicans for making it even more expensive to the middle-class and to the media for making it appear that all of this has been for the best because patients are not yet being turned away. If we allow private insurers to keep robbing “Uncle Sam’s” pockets blind with willing partners in all of the usual suspects including the secretive bureaucracy known as the “Deep State”, you can bet your bottom dollar they’ll get it too!                                                       “KNEE-CAP PLAN”The “Knee-Cap Plan” will be administered on the county level by the county commission. Each county commission will open a Medicare, Medicaid and CHiP account to deposit a check from the federal government for the amount spent in that county during the last fiscal year on Medicare and Medicaid, as determined by the Congressional Budget Office. CHiP is a part of Medicaid, so the amount spent on Medicaid will include the amount spent on CHiP, we will need that broken down because we will be opening a separate CHiP account. The people of the county will be asked to dig-deep and donate to insure these accounts are adequately funded. The governor will open state Medicare and Medicaid accounts and the federal government will supply two billion dollars, so the governor can deposit one billion dollars in each of these accounts. True conservatives are nothing if not realistic, and they will recognize right away that for the state accounts of the “Knee-Cap Plan” to start out with only one billion dollars each is totally unrealistic, but we’re trying to save the federal government money, so why not ask state businesses to kick-in a lot extra to get the balances up to $140,000,000,000.00 in appreciation for businesses not being required to provide healthcare coverage. Each county will be required to pay 10% of the money paid to them for Medicare and Medicaid to the state accounts to be used to supplement counties that are spending more than they are taking in during the first five years, allowing the county the opportunity to solve the problem in other ways besides adjusting the rates people pay, which the county will not be able to do during the first five years, although, moving money from one account to the other is an option if only one account is behind. After the first five years, the state accounts should be used strictly for medical bills when there is some disaster, whether natural or otherwise, or to supplement the needs of a county experiencing high unemployment, at the discretion of the governor. The federal government will also maintain Medicare and Medicaid accounts funded by each state paying 10% of what they collect from the counties to be used in the event of disasters effecting more than one state, or at the discretion of the president provided it is used strictly for medical expenses or to supplement a state experiencing high unemployment. The federal accounts should initially be funded with $1 billion each. In this case, I suggest we go to Corporate America to adequately fund these accounts. This is an increase in the cost to the federal government the first year, but the federal government will be completely out from under the burden of having to fund Medicare and Medicaid annually. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS): The CMS employs over 6,000 employees, of which about 4,000 are located at its headquarters in Woodlawn, Maryland. The remaining employees are located in the Hubert H. Humphrey Building in Washington, D.C., the 10 regional offices, and in various field offices located throughout the United States. The head of the CMS is the Administrator of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The position is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate Seema Verma has been confirmed by the US Senate as Administrator of CMS, a top healthcare position in the Trump administration. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.) This is the savings in the annual cost of administering Medicare and Medicaid from the counties, as opposed to the greater DC area. Over 6,000 employees that are totally unnecessary. Maryland claims a move like this would decimate their economy but: “Maryland is the richest state in the United States of America…”Politicians methods for dealing with opioid drug addiction is exactly the opposite of what drug addicts tell them, (why?), virtually everyone in prison, regardless of the charge that put them there, that were addicted to drugs or alcohol at the time they were locked-up, claim that getting locked-up saved their lives. “The central issue is that the House health care bill would phase out ""Obamacare's"" expanded Medicaid, which allows states to provide federally backed insurance to low-income adults previously not eligible. Many people in that demographic are in their 20s and 30s and dealing with opioid addiction. Dollars from Washington have allowed states to boost their response to the crisis, paying for medication, counseling, therapy and other services.” (The AP: by Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar.)  Addicts in prison tell everyone that getting locked-up saved their lives. Politicians ignore the truth, a 360-day misdemeanor sentence that cannot be shortened by “good-time” with a 5 to 10-day weaning period with Methadone is how their lives are saved and the addiction defeated. The only counseling or therapy necessary is job training, exercise and time. Less than a year, so it’s only a misdemeanor because a year sentence is a felony. But enough time for them to realize, for themselves without counseling, how much better off they are, since being freed from their addiction. Opioids leave the blood system, five days usually, ten days max. No-one should be on Methadone for life. Chronic pain should never be treated with an opioid or any other addictive pain killer. Twenty to thirty-year-old’s, beating their addiction, getting a job making more than $30,000.00/yr. and paying for Medicaid Health Insurance covers the cost of the expanded Medicaid described in this county run system. Especially when it is handled on the county level where county officials can work directly with the medical personnel involved when paying medical bills. PREPARING THE GROUNDWORK FOR DECNTRALIZING THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE President Trump will need a carefully prepared speech to the governors of the fifty states promoting the advantages of maximized autonomy of the counties in exchange for accepting the increased responsibilities of funding and administering all entitlement programs for the people of the county, through “Decentralizing the Administrative State” with a 15% income-tax. A key point here is that more than enough employees than are needed to administer these programs are, already, working in the county doing that job. The president will announce that an executive order to this effect will be signed and call upon the governors to, forthwith, convene a meeting with the county commissioners of their state to lay out the details of counties becoming the smallest form of government under the state, per the Founding Fathers to pay the national debt without mercilessly gutting the benefits that so many have come to rely upon. No doubt, all counties may want to make changes to some programs or discontinue others, but counties being closest to the people are best suited for making these difficult decisions and carrying them out in a way that is not merciless. The commissioners will, initially elect a county mayor themselves, preferably the present mayor of the largest city in the county, to preside over the transition. (During the special election, to be held in 2021, the people will elect the county mayor, as well as, the commissioners.) This message will be carried by the commissioners to the mayors, city councilmen and town councils to describe how the transition will take place.  For two years, all town and/or city employees will be kept on, during that time, decisions will be made determining how many are needed to carry-on the business of the county. There will no longer be city mayors, city councilmen or town councils but there will be all present commissioners and some additional county commissioners and a county mayor to be elected. In Harrison County West Virginia, the borders of the small town of Lost Creek will be the borders of the district of Lost Creek with its own commissioner to represent Lost Creeks’ interests, not just a neighborhood, as proposed by your County Commission President, who would be guilty of “High Treason” against the county if there were such a thing, proposing that Clarksburg usurp the power of two counties. For what? Greater dependence on federal dollars that is being used to twist the arms of mayors across the country. All residents of the county will have the same services available to them depending on their needs and these services will come off the top of the county budget. The County Commission will decide how to best portion the rest of the budget. Per district per capita may prove to be the fairest way. But it will not be possible to skew in favor of the most populated district or group of districts. If it is to be skewed at all, it will be away from the most populated to the least populated districts with districts that had previously been small towns being favored to promote their continued growth. How the county mayor and commissioners decide to budget the money will be shared with the public annually. Doing the deal: The first step is a “Repatriation Holiday at 15%” to bring trillions back into our banks to get the economy moving in a strong positive direction. The second step is an “Executive Order” calling on the governors to inform the counties to begin collecting a 15% income tax from all residents of the county October 1st, 2019, in preparation for the counties to take over all funding and administration of state and federal programs using the same people presently performing these jobs and detailing the paragraph that follows. The third step is to deed over all property owned by the state or federal government in the county to the county. All property associated with the State Road including all trucks and equipment, except for what is needed to maintain the interstate highway system, will be deeded to the county. The Board of Education (it will be clearly stated that counties will have total control of public education, through 12th grade), Health and Human Resources, Social Security, HUD, etc. along with all responsibility for payroll and every aspect of administering and funding these programs and services will be turned over to the county. This will take place quickly in Hawaii where there are no municipalities smaller than the county and in many other counties around the country where there are no town or city governments’ only the county. The mayors and city councilmen of municipalities smaller than the county will become members of the county commission appointed by the county commission to carry out the business of the city for two years while assisting in making it a smooth transition from being separate entities to become a single entity. The commissioners will, initially elect a county mayor themselves, the mayor of the county seat or the mayor of the largest city in the county, to preside over the transition. All employees of the municipalities will be kept on for at least two years. For example: City police forces will be deputized at their current rank, chiefs of police will be the commanding officer of a branch office of the sheriffs’ department that will continue to operate out of their city police headquarters. County elections will be postponed if necessary and a special election will be scheduled in two years. At this time all county commissioners and the county mayor will be elected by the people.A look at the U. S. Military and how a return to tradition can better prepare us for the future: A more secure future using the best technology that takes overt security to the highest level.             National Guard vs. Reserves by Jeffrey Joyne: The United States Armed Forces are comprised of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard is under the control of the Department of Homeland Security, while the other four branches report to the Department of Defense. As of 2011, the combined total of active-duty personnel was about 2.3 million, with an additional 846,000 people in the National Guard and reserves. Although there are many similarities between the National Guard and reserves, there are significant differences.” … “The primary difference between the guard and reserve components lies in the command. Reserve units are part of the federal armed forces, and as such they are under presidential command. Guard units are organized on the state level, and the governor can call them to service in response to civil riots or natural disasters. The president has the power to federalize guard troops, if needed, but a governor has no control over reserve units.“Americas Reserve and National Guard Components” by Col. Richard J. Dunn III “Militia service is as old as the United States. Before independence, local communities formed their own security forces, composed of citizens who would rally in times of emergency, to protect their towns from external threats. After independence, the individual states remained in the habit of raising forces—militias—as needed, providing units to complement those of the federal forces as was the case during the U.S. Civil War.” … “The relationships between the National Guard, the full-time Active federal forces, and the Active Components’ Reserve elements have changed over time as the needs of the country have changed. For much of its history, the U.S. maintained a small Active component that was expanded by draft or mobilized reserves during times of war. Following the Vietnam War, the shift to an all-volunteer force and the heightening of tensions with the Soviet Union led to sustainment of a large standing military that changed the relationship between Active and Reserve/Guard elements, with Active elements kept in a ready status that would enable them to respond immediately to any Soviet aggression while the Reserve and Guard elements served as a strategic reserve.” “…The Vietnam War and its aftermath had a profound impact on U.S. senior military leadership in many ways and on the relationship between the Active and Reserve components. General Creighton Abrams, who as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army had overseen the preparation of Army forces for deployment to Vietnam and who had served as commander of all forces in that engagement, became Army Chief of Staff in 1972 and began to restore the combat effectiveness of an Army that had seen its morale crumble during the Vietnam War. To enhance readiness and expand the size of the force available for large-scale operations, he and then-Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird created the Total Army concept that integrated the Active and Reserve components much more closely. Some have argued that one reason for this approach was to make it impossible for the Army to go to war again without the Guard and Reserve. Some also claimed that the resulting “Abrams Doctrine” would limit the ability of future Presidents and Congresses to commit the U.S. to war without first garnering the public support required to mobilize and commit the Reserve components. However, the historical record does not substantiate this claim. The Abrams Doctrine led the Army to integrate the components to the degree that a third of the force structure of most Army divisions stationed in the continental U.S. was made up of National Guard units. To provide the President with the necessary access to the Guard and Reserve absent a declaration of war or declared national emergency, Congress created the Presidential Reserve Callup Authority in 1976. “…With time to train and properly prepare before deployment, Army National Guard brigades began to assume their place in a rotation schedule for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. “At one point in 2005, half of the combat brigades in Iraq were Army National Guard—a percentage of commitment as part of the overall Army effort not seen since the first years of World War II.”  With combat rotations scheduled well in advance, Reserve component units were given the same time and training resources to prepare for deployment that Active component units received. Active component units train throughout the year, honing their ability to execute both tactical actions and higher-level operations that, due to their complexity, place great demands on senior-level staffs. Guard and Reserve performance in Iraq and Afghanistan was as good as it was not only because of the dedication of the members involved, but also because they were given the time and resources required to train to the same tactical standards as Active component forces before they deployed.Balancing Roles. Traditionally, the Guard and Reserve components have served as a national strategic reserve force, a national asset that can be mobilized in times of significant crisis to provide expanded military capacity to the Joint Force. In the recent engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, they have often served as an operational reserve, filling the manpower needs of an overly taxed Active component. “As an operational reserve,” writes Dr. Daniel Gouré of the Lexington Institute, “Guard forces participated routinely and regularly in ongoing military missions. Entire Guard brigade combat teams (BCTs) were deployed to both conflicts, [and] Guard officers commanded entire multi-national Corps in Iraq.” To their credit, the Guard and Reserve components filled this role well, but it has made them more closely resemble the Active component. The time required to prepare and train to deploy, and the overseas deployments themselves, have exceeded what had previously been expected of individuals not serving full-time in the Active military component.A Critical Component of National SecurityOur armed forces must be prepared to support an effective national military strategy across the full range of potential threats that the nation faces in the current and uncertain future threat environment. This calls for Guard and Reserve component forces to be postured for action in ways that best suit their organizational nature, their access to resources, and the demands of evolving operational and strategic requirements. In general, the Reserve component, composed of Guard and Reserve forces, best supports the country by serving as the nation’s insurance policy in the event that the Active component finds itself in major combat operations rather than by substituting for the Active component in smaller contingencies due to an undersized Active force.” … “The men and women who compose the Reserve components are a testament to the desire, willingness, and ability of our countrymen to serve the security interests of our nation while also contributing to the wealth, resiliency, vitality, and stability of our nation on a daily basis in their various capacities as private citizens when not soldiering. Our Reserve and National Guard forces are national assets that must be resourced and supported in a manner that is commensurate with their critical functions in preservation of the nation’s security.Second Amendment: A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.It’s time to have well-regulated, state militias that are under the command of the state governor and recognize that the right and the desire of the people to keep and bear arms in the nuclear age is to defend their home against intruders and for hunting. Semi-automatic and fully-automatic weapons and silencers for all firearms must be totally banned from sale to the public and an effort must be made to confiscate existing ones. Deadly weapons must be banned from use by law enforcement except for use by SWAT teams.Eighth Amendment: “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”“Listen, you can defend torture, or you can defend the Constitution. Not both. The 8th Amendment explicitly forbids torture with all forms of cruel and unusual punishment. To defend torture is to attack the Constitution.” Mar. 15, 2018 Edward Snowden, American Hero Defending against terrorism using technology and an entirely overt strategy inside the country: In recognition of the changes sense the break-up of the Soviet Union, and the clear and present danger of a terrorist attack on American soil. I propose that we return to the traditional use of the National Guard and The Reserves and bring all of them home. The National Guard will take up its traditional role as state militia under the command of the governor. Furthermore, that President Donald Trump will order The Reserves to act as part of the State Militia, so they can train together an extra weekend each month, for additional pay, as a battalion. This battalion will have four companies, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines; Here in West Virginia most of the old State Farm in Huttonsville has gone fallow for many years. I propose a large portion of the old State Farm be designated as a training ground for the troops. For their first gathering they will bivouac for a month. The first order of business, at the end of the first week will be to elect four company commanders; 3 Captains and the Navy Commander. After 3 week’s they will elect a Lieutenant Colonel to be commanding officer of the battalion. They will meet an additional weekend each month in Huttonsville and an additional 2 weeks during the winter, maybe with Super Bowl weekend in the middle would be a good time, it seems a drive-in theater would be useful for training purposes to Google Earth real-time, militarily enhanced, to be students of the action in Afghanistan and Iraq under General Mattis.As for the Active Duty Personnel, it is time to ramp up the forces to full training capacity. New recruits must be guaranteed they will not be sent to war unless it is on United States soil, during their first four years of active duty. This will bring far greater numbers of volunteers to the service. Only Active Duty Personnel that re-up after their initial four years of service will be sent to war on foreign soil. I totally agree with Trump about pulling out of Syria. Syria is worse than Vietnam. We need to focus on Iraq and Afghanistan and put as many Active Duty Personnel with more than four years-service on the ground in these two countries as we possibly can. We must secure the borders of these two countries. We need to construct a twelve-foot tall chain-link fence on the border Fifty yards to a two-lane road with a substantial, yet see through fence with motion sensors built-in, fifty yards off the inside of the road to be able to adequately patrol the borders of Iraq and Afghanistan. We must ramp up; production of fixed position and land roving robot tanks and flying drone defense systems to act as full-time perimeter forces that can be deployed that never sleep and do not kill, but together can incapacitate hundreds or thousands, crossing a border at once while sounding the alarm for the closest troops to come on the run, so we can secure the borders of Iraq and Afghanistan. The outer chain-link fence with signs and speakers that can explain the situation: Motion sensors will detect your presence and surveillance cameras will track your movements. Disarm yourselves and leave your weapons inside the fence and move across the road. If you follow these directions, we will bring food and water and provide you with shelter.  Careful consideration should be given to deploying Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems in central locations in both nations after the borders have been secured and a democratic republic is in place, with a military. This will require an international airport along-side so that we will be able to insure the security of these installations, as well. Set up “Border inspection Depots” at high traffic points, allowing everyone in, if they have been strip-searched to confiscate all weapons. Beginning the vetting process nearby before allowing them to freely roam the interior and providing food and shelter in Iraq or Afghanistan for these refugees. It is time to stand up for what we believe in and print the United States Constitution in the Afghan and Iraq languages and deliver copies to their people, begin the process by electing county commissioners. And allow the elected county commissioners to use it as a guide if they wish but these elected officials must gather scholars to write their document providing the process for the only acceptable form of government in the “New Millennium”, one that is elected by the people. The County “As the form of government closest to the people, counties offer a unique perspective that makes them critical players in decisions affecting their citizens and as state and local governments evolve, counties will continue to play a prominent role.” County commissioners must take charge of drafting their national constitution and planning their national elections and dividing the nation into separate states along ethnic lines to avoid future internal conflicts. How many of the CIA’s dictators have we ended up having to kill ourselves? That is clearly a failed strategy. The CIA’s reason for putting dictators in power is that dictators are supposed to be more stable business partners. “However, the historical record does not substantiate this claim”, I quote these words from above and acknowledge they were not used in this context, though, these words are clearly true in this context.Traditionally the National Guard has been the state militia under the governors’ command. The State Police, DNR and DEP will become a part of the state militia and train with the National Guard and The Reserves one weekend per month and for two weeks in the winter to prepare for a possible terrorist attack. The State Police will have detector booths wherever a road crosses the state line that can detect sensors attached to the cars. People that travel the road on a regular basis will be issued a license tag containing a sensor that contains coding that match the tag to the vehicle, so they can cross the state border without stopping. When someone is just passing through, they just stop at the booth and scan their driver license. A camera in the middle of the road will read the tag to determine if the car is stolen. If someone drives through a booth without stopping or the tag does not match the license, the State Police will be automatically alerted that someone has entered the state illegally. The vehicle will be tracked automatically by GPS and the closest State Police dispatch will be automatically notified to evaluate the situation and take appropriate action.The role of State Police will be more limited allowing county sheriff’s department full responsibility for county resident’s activities within the county. The State Police will investigate criminal activity by business owners, county officials and criminal activity including drug traffic in the state across county lines and across the state line. And patrol the interstate highways. The DNR and DEP rolls as members of the militia will be expanded, logging much more time walking the state lines, becoming familiar with the terrain and working with land owners to have their support. Their main role in the National Guard and Reserves will be to clear it with land owners when the Battalion will bivouac along remote portions of the state line. The State Militia will become familiar with all parts of the state line and develop plans to defend the state if the need should ever arise. The State Militia will work with the State Police to develop plans that provide State Police Swat Teams with limited levels support when called upon and to provide full Militia support when deemed necessary.Dealing with the drug and alcohol problem within the ranks:The military is not the general public, and alcohol and drugs have been promoted within the ranks as weapons to destroy our military from within, primarily alcohol. The old worn out arguments that the military should have the right drowned the stress of their job in a bottle must be abandoned in recognition of the scope of the current problem. All alcohol and drugs must be banned from all military bases with searches at the gate. If these men want to drink, they can do it off base. Alcoholism has been used as a prerequisite for promotion, I don’t need any proof that this is true, all Active Duty personnel are aware that this is true. Case in point: Navy Seals! Alcohol and drugs must be quarantined from all United States Military Bases around the world. Navy Seals and all other military with drug or alcohol addiction, must be detained on base for a minimum of one year and only treated with decreasing amounts of Methadone for five to ten days for opioid addiction. Alcoholics should be given Ativan at the onset of Detrimental Trimmers. This must be a team effort. Team-work is what the military is all about, and when it comes to Special Forces, team-work must be sacrosanct. Those that do not have a drug or alcohol problem should be right there for those that are going through withdrawals. Just because they are being detained on base doesn’t mean they can’t go out and train with their unit in a strictly’ drug-free and alcohol-free environment. They need to be out there sweating it out. This is something the politicians have gotten totally wrong. I did 12.5 years in prison, and the only ones happy to be there were drug addicts and severe alcoholics, most all of them said the same thing, “I would be dead by now if I had not been locked-up!”The Chambered Nautilus:County lines will be patrolled by High School and College cross-country athletes and other citizens, not in any official capacity, but simply being aware of who the people are that frequent these areas. So that when someone is trying to flee from county to county or state to state after committing a crime it will be much more difficult to get away with it. County officials will make this safe in urban areas and where highways are crossed by providing wide ramped overpasses for joggers and walkers. County officials will work with landowners to make this happen across ranches and farmland. This will make it nearly impossible for someone to get away with kidnapping and transporting the victim across state lines undetected, much less, clear across the country, or someone to drive around committing multiple murders or bank robberies without being caught. When overt security is taken to the highest level that our technological capabilities now make possible, covert security is no longer necessary. Covert security will be abandoned inside and outside of the country in favor of overt security. The active military with more than 4-years in the service will handle all security outside the country using full disclosure overt that relies entirely on drones to gather information that will travel quickly up and down the chain of command and to the local public delivered by a military media that will provide the facts directly to the public and the local media. It will be passed into federal law and military law that all information being used to take military or police action must be made available to the local public before action is taken. If this is seen as making securing the situation more difficult this will be accepted as a small price to pay for the end of secrecy. Secrecy is the source of endless corruption. It will be assumed that 99% of the time, full disclosure of the reasons for  defensive action being shared with those being defended will make achieving the goal easier. Those that the action is being taken against will be informed of the reasons and the action that will be taken if they refuse to surrender and resolve the situation peacefully. The military, state police and county sheriff’s department will be required to provide security with everyone fully aware of what is going on and why at all times. Any failure to provide all information that has resulted military or police action will be considered an illegal attempt to keep the motives for action a secret. In the future the federal government will rely entirely on the  military to provide all security. To make cyber space more secure for US citizens, guarantee privacy, and provide a process for the courts to gain access to any specific communication deemed necessary. The county will record all communications coming into and out of the county and between citizens of the county in a secure facility that guarantees that; “No one has listened to these communications, but they have been securely made accessible to the local circuit court only”. These communications will not be accessed by a simple warrant, they will only be accessed when, during a trial, there are claims that a specific communication or a specific series of communications contains information that could affect the outcome of the case. When the case is not local, public hearings will be held in the local circuit court to determine whether the communications will be made available. When it is a federal agency, there will be strict guidelines directing the request first through a Federal Court, then to the State Supreme Court, before approaching the County Circuit Court to ensure that local authorities are not intimidated by a federal agency, as well as, to demonstrate the high priority and importance of protecting privacy and the fourth amendment. Amendment IVThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.This will be designed specifically to prevent a Federal Agency or anyone else from invading the privacy of US citizens. It will not prevent a Federal Agency from listening to or recording international calls on the side coming into the country, that portion of the communication will be vulnerable, but the US portion will be so thoroughly encrypted that masking will not be necessary and unmasking will not be possible without help from the county. This is the way to prepare our country for the inevitable arrival of AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it relates to the IoT (Internet of Things). What is needed is for each county to be a system that can be effectively isolated with the touch of a button or automatically, to prevent a breach of the control of the IoT systems information to protect ourselves from the unknown future ramifications of AI. It would be wise for each county to employ techies who attempt to, with all due respect to Native Americans, “count coup” on other counties by breaching their system in a strictly benign way, to improve defenses. “It’s one of the cultural artifacts that somehow was handed down in my family. It wasn’t until I was an adult that I realized two things:  First that everyone didn’t know what that meant and second, that it might be significant. Made Mom happy (to me, that’s pretty significant all by itself). But counting coup has a much deeper history beginning long ago and perhaps on both sides of the Atlantic.” (Touché).  … “Counting coup refers to the winning of prestige in battle, rather than having to prove a win by injuring one’s opponent.” Posted 10,5,2012 by Roberta Estes, Native Heritage ProjectThis is the way to secure FaceBook, so that people are confident that their information is being held within their county and when they communicate with friends in other counties their information is not available to that county. When you communicate with friends in another state your information will be shielded by another layer of security. The end result to be that, Robert Mercer’s algorithms or those developed by Cambridge Analytica would be required to go through a licensing process state by state and county by county. I suspect that every county will be determined to make it illegal for personal information to be used to target the people of their county for any reason and mind-altering algorithms certainly must be banned. “Monster Tech Corporations” are not doing a service to customers by collecting information on the sights you visit so they can customize their offerings to your personal needs, this is an invasion of privacy that has crept into our world and our lives using false claims suggesting that it all to better serve the public. Cambridge Analytica taught us that this is about shaping your thoughts, which is? Programming you. I’ve got the new book “Hello World” by Hannah Fry on its way and I hope to learn more from it to be more specific about addressing this problem. I just received “TRANCE: FORMATION of AMERICA” by Cathy O’Brien with Mark Phillips that I checked out of a library circa 2002, unfortunately I saw a video by Ms. O’Brien in which she describes herself as diagnosed with PTSD, which means she has fallen back into the hands of her abusers. I have also received several books mentioned by Ms. Moyo’s awesome, “Rock this World” Edge of Chaos but I want to get this back out to you as soon as possible wrapped around these two awesome new books. To have a Congressman be in the position Jason Chaffetz was in and then to write about it now, is absolutely incredible timing. These two books, Edge of Chaos and The Deep State you must read. Legal Information Institute: Article III Section 1.The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.Section 2.The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to controversies between two or more states;--between a state and citizens of another state;--between citizens of different states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.Section 3.Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.The state will make secrecy of any kind by state or county government strictly illegal. All activity by all state and county officials will be carried out in such a way that it cannot be found to have been purposefully hidden from the public. No secret organization, no matter how benign they claim their reasons are for being secretive will be tolerated. All state intelligence agencies or security agencies and any other state run or privately operated secret agency will be required to order all personnel to report to the county court house where they live, bringing with them all computer files pertaining to their work, prepared to work in the court house or a location provided for the purpose as long as they expect it will take to prepare a full report of their activities over the past five years or since being hired that explains more thoroughly the information they have compiled. Banning secrecy will also be brought before the people to vote on as a state constitutional amendment.I want to clarify that, although the county will accept all federal and state laws pertaining to individual people. It will no longer be the state or federal governments job to enforce or enact laws that pertain to individuals. This will be left to the county, and the county Sheriff’s department, in the future the county will be the only form of government with the authority to pass laws effecting individual people and the county sheriff’s department will be the only police force with the authority to enforce laws or arrest citizens of the county. Repeal of state and federal laws will be the same except the county commission will be a go between for the people and either the State House of Delegates or the Federal House of Representatives. The county commission will be called upon to make use of the many lawyers they now have at their disposal, that no longer work for the state, to examine state and federal law with the goal of identifying laws that need to be repealed. When the county commission decides that a state or federal law should be repealed, they will email a copy of the law to all voting age residents of the county to get consensus on whether the people agree that the law should be repealed, if at least 55% are in favor of repeal, the commissioner will bring this to the attention of the other county commissioners and to the representatives attention and it will be the representatives job to bring it to the attention of the State House of Delegates for them to gather consensus information and begin weighing the pro’s and con’s, of repealing the law. When 55% of county people are in favor of repeal of a federal law it will be brought to the attention the member of House of Representatives. A county that feels a state or federal law that was repealed worked for them, can pass it as a county law. All calls for a Convention to alter the United States Constitution must be thwarted to avoid the possibility of losing far more than what the Convention was proposed to achieve, even to the point of losing the entire United States Constitution. The changes to the federal government will give the house, senate and executive branch of the federal government more time to devote to foreign policy: NATO, The United Nations, and The International Court, the Organization of American States (OAS), etc. and trade: NAFTA, The World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), etc. The US should seriously consider stepping back from all of these organizations to reconsider our role in them or whether to remain in them accept NATO, OAS and  the OECD. Just as the state will govern only the counties, leaving it to the counties to govern the people. The federal government will govern only the states, leaving it to the states to govern the counties. All counties will be sanctuary counties for illegal immigrants presently living in the county, but they will be required to begin the necessary process to become a legal citizen of the United States. The county sheriff’s department will be solely responsible for traffic violations on all roads in the county except the interstate highways. All criminal activity within the county by county residence will be their sole responsibility. When the sheriffs finds criminal activity operating across county lines, if the sheriff’s departments of a two counties can work together to make the arrests, that’s fine, but when three counties are involved the county sheriff’s department will be required to notify the state police and all three or more counties will report their findings to the state police who will begin their own investigation relying on what the counties supply them to issue state warrants for drug traffickers and crime rings within the state. The state police must have the county serve warrants and make arrests of county residents. The state police will be solely responsible for patrolling the interstate highways and investigating crimes by county officials and the businesses the state taxes and crime within the state operating across county lines. It will be the responsibility of the state police to choose which circuit court to file in based on the influence the suspects may have to obtain a neutral venue or simply on what court has the least on their docket. Federal law enforcement will cease to exist in its present form and DOJ will form the new Federal Law Enforcement Agency (FLEA), dedicated to living up to the motto “We wouldn’t Hurt a Flea”, sorry, I just couldn’t resist that when I looked at this anacronym, and required to live stream all activities to DOJ and Congress at all times, no exceptions. FLEA will have extremely limited authority over individual citizens and will be required to have the state contact the county to have the county sheriff serve federal warrants and make all arrests, their focus will be criminal activity in state government and criminal activity in the businesses the federal government taxes. The primary focus of federal law enforcement will be organized crime. Just as state law enforcements involvement in individuals’ crimes will be greatly limited except where it involves trafficking across county lines and the state line, federal law enforcements involvement in individuals’ crimes will be greatly limited except where it involves trafficking across state lines when two states request assistance in addressing a problem and will be required when more than two states have become involved.When a FLEA peace officer is suspected of killing anyone, they will be required to turn themselves into the Army Judge Advocate General to be arrested and charged with murder. All peace officers suspected of killing anyone will automatically be arrested and charged with murder, held in custody for at least seven days during the initial investigation, be tried for murder and suspended with pay until the outcome of the trial. When a state police peace officer is suspected of killing anyone, they will be required to turn themselves in the Department of Justice to be arrested by FLEA and tried in federal court. When a sheriff’s department peace officer is suspected of killing anyone, they will be required to turn themselves in to the state police to be arrested and tried by the state supreme court. This will be a new role for state supreme courts trying murder cases involving peace officers of county sheriff’s departments. Since only drug addicts will do prison time and murders will be exiled to the Yukon there will be fewer appeals so the state supreme will have time to try these cases. Also, there will be very few of these cases because peace officers will no longer carry deadly weapons. When deadly force is called for it will come in the form of a swat team. JAG will continue to have jurisdiction over all military personnel except when the crime is murder, then the suspect will be required to turn themselves in to DOJ to be arrested by FLEA and charged with murder to be tried in federal court.Satisfying the need to Educate the Politicians of the Future:There is a great need for college professors with real world experience from the highest level of our government, to prepare political science, and prelaw students for careers in politics. I suspect that any college would jump at the opportunity to have an experienced congressman teach a class about their life in politics. What an advantage it would be for future politicians to learn the ways to avoid being compromised, rather than trying to navigate these rocky shores in gale-force winds. What about doing away with the rocky shores and the gale force winds and teaching how to avoid falling back into these dangerous, stormy conditions. What I am referring to is the intelligence community, when they have all been retired and secrecy of any kind is strictly illegal it will be important for future politicians to be educated into understanding the ways politicians were compromised to fully understand the importance of transparency in government to preserve democracy and the rule of law. Secrecy in government of any kind breeds corruption but secrecy in democracy that relies upon the rule of law creates corrupt agencies that are above the law. Future politicians must understand this to avoid the pitfalls allowing secrecy to creep back In. Looking at teaching as your next important step in life I urge that all congressmen with more than twelve years in office that recognize the need to pass down a fiscally sound federal government to well-prepared future politicians, get behind this full package, to make it happen. And support a term limits bill limiting the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives to a maximum of twelve years, as a part of this package. The US House of Representatives two-year terms are too short and should be changed to six-year terms with this term being for three years the next election to the House being held in 2021 to always have a three-year offset from Senate elections. The US House and Senate will serve a maximum of two, six-year terms in office, during their second or final term in office they will not be able to run for public office at any level. In recognition of the need for mature, experienced candidates in these high offices, there will be a minimum age limit of fifty for future candidates included in this bill that will not affect present underage members until they come up for re-election. The fact that this law will respect the constitutional minimum age requirements by exceeding them it will be viewed as constitutional by the USSC. With the increased responsibility at the county level, young political science majors and young lawyers with political ambitions should be encouraged to begin their political careers in county government working their way up through the state to the federal level. All county, state and federal employees, whether elected, appointed or hired must be required to wear body-cams with audio, 24/7 to ensure that the decisions they make and the words they speak are their own and not a programmed response. All activity during business hours must be live streamed to constituents. The winds of change are blowing, and Congress knows how great the need for change is, better than anyone else. Congress has the power to order the moles from their holes! Do you in the Congress of the United States of America have the fortitude, the strength of mind that enables one to endure adversity with courage, to weather the storm that will come upon us when we stand up to the entire secret intelligence community. We know they have compromising information on you, but we also know that you were coerced to do things that you wish you had never done. Therefore, we forgive you and ask you now, to grant all elected officials from county, state and federal government immunity from past crimes and make it federal law that all elected officials wear body-cams 24/7 while holding public office. Order all American citizens home from abroad to provide cover for the men and women of the intelligence community that will make the effort to comply with the order for all intelligence agents to return state-side and file reports on their career and recommendations on how to proceed in a transparent world committed to the use of overt security and the end of covert security. Resolve yourselves to indict and imprison those that will make a fight of it. This battle must be fault now, while we still have our constitution and the rule of law and young and old who are waking up to the truth of how we have been victimized. The youth of today will be the incorruptible adults of the future because they know how they have been victimized and will be highly motivated to prevent a return to secrecy and the corruption that comes with it. But it is up to those of us over 35 or 40 to stand tall and lead this fight. Determined that this fight is for the United States Constitution and that no changes are needed to this document because our Founding Fathers were aware of the pitfalls of secrecy in government and they provided no avenue for the protection of secrecy in government, the right to privacy in ones’ home, yes and communications, please. We are not asking that elected officials share the 24/7 recordings of body-cams with the public all the time, only that they be available to you to protect yourself and that you only live-stream when acting in your official capacity as a public servant. The remainder of the recordings would only be made available to the public if the need arises during a trial, the same as the proposed telecommunications warrant, a far higher standard than FISA. This will likely prove more useful in protecting yourself from being compromised than being used to protect the public from you. Sad, sad Americans not fully programmed enough to survive the Chinese Nazi-communist purge but too programmed to try to stop it. Trump has done some things that if we built on them, we could turn this whole thing around. Programming is a form of coercion and coercion is illegal. He told European countries they are going to have to do more to defend their countries. We need to concentrate on stabilizing Israel, Iraq, Afghanistan and Venezuela and tell the rest of the world there will be no more foreign aid until we pay off our own debt. We should promise to aide only democracies in the future and promise countries like Greece that when we have paid our debt, we will assist you in paying your debt if you are using enhanced body-cams to deprogram democratic leaders. We are a democracy and we must make a commitment to democracy and engage in promoting democratic republics based on the rule of law. Call on all dictatorships, whether they are monarchies or communist to adopt these enhanced body-cams to put an end to this history of fanatical control through programming. Xi and Kim, no matter how thorough their programming since birth still have that innate saving grace that calls out for controlling themselves, as opposed to being controlled by others. China, Russia, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and all other non-democratic countries will find their own way to democracy if we take these simple steps to sure-up our own democracy and sure-up failing democracies and stabilize and promote democracies where we have been drawn into conflict. Trump has been exposed to the two groups that display tyrannical behavior of the slave-ship captain retired to his plantation of slaves for twenty years, that is television directors and master chefs and the republican party recognized that by putting people like Mike Pence, John Kelly and Mike Pompeo in his face, they could control him, but his programming is not as focused on Alt-right politics as Pence is. We must wake-up and recognize the golden opportunity we have with Donald Trump being president of the United States of America. This man is truly a non-racist moderate that is willing to rule by consensus, but the republican party has not allowed this man to do anything he set out to do.What ignited the character assassination that began 1987? It seems kind of strange now, but the petition I wrote in 1984 was about building two border fences along the Mexican border about 200 yards from each other with a two-lane road running down the middle. The outer fence would be 12ft high, easy to get over but with motion sensors, so the Border Patrol could move in before they could get over the taller, more difficult to cross second fence. I wasn’t interested in deporting anyone. I wanted the two fences to swing north around Big Bend National Park and build a vetting center there and let the people have a neutral zone while finding a place for them and making most of them citizens in about a six-month period. When anyone was refused, they didn’t have to go back, I thought the Big Bend could hold a small town of those denied entry that stayed but most would be in transition. I’ve since found that Big Bend is a pretty rare and special environment. Seeing as how that was 30 years ago, I’ve had a lot of time to mull this over. And I saw in the news, that the towns east of Big Bend don’t want to change the way it is because their economy depends on the workers that cross the border every day. We do need powerfully strong borders to defend our country against terrorism with an entirely overt strategy. Starting out west, I propose that we build a three-lane border bridge (the symbolic wall), that runs along the top of a hundred or more check points, however many are needed to keep traffic moving, so every vehicle can be thoroughly inspected from end to end removing everything inside a tractor-trailer, family car or FedEx truck, so no-one has to wait very long in the hot sun. If the four people that work in a check point are not needed, they hop in a Humvee and head east into the mountains on patrol. If they are needed, they’re just called back in. When you drive off the top of the inspection stations in southern California that is the symbolic wall the road moves a hundred yards from the border with the low sensor fence extending from above the last inspection station along the border and the 30ft tall see through fence 100yds north of the three-lane road. I propose that these two fences and the three-lane continue, uninterrupted from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. With the 12ft fence being about 100yds from the floodplain of the Rio Grande when the fences get to where the Rio Grande runs along the border. South of Laredo, about half way to Roma, I propose that the border fences and three-lane turn east toward the Gulf with fences only seventy-five yards apart with road in the center, running just north of Roma and the rest of the border cities.Trump is right to put the National Guard on the border, but I believe California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas need to have border crossings onto federal land that are designated welcoming centers where the vetting process can begin with full transparency. Lukeville, Arizona is surrounded by Forest Service property and would be a good place to start handing out yurts and setting up KOA type, campgrounds with security fences set back at least 3 miles from the area being used for camping. The vetting process should begin as soon as an immigrant meets Border Patrol. The immigrant caravan should be directed to come here. We should be welcoming everyone that wants to come to our country. We need immigration to supply the needs of science, engineering and technology and those willing and able to do menial jobs in the face of the horrible mess that a Washington run school system and German psychology has made. I was taught this strategy, that is based on the writings of the Founding Fathers, 40 years ago by a professor at WVU. He had concluded that politicians would never enact this strategy on their own. He believed it would only happen when the national debt reached a critical point and even then, only by enormous peaceful pressure from the people. It can happen, but it won’t without a tidal wave of public support. I am painstakingly sending this to every county in the USA, County Commissioners, Treasurers, and Assessors requesting that they do analysis of how this would play out in their county and asking that they share the results with the citizens of their county.  I believe sharing this information with your people will get them firmly behind it. This is how we can get this done. By doing the analysis on the county level, governors will want to know the results of the analysis on the state level. When that happens there will be growing pressure for analysis on the federal level. Don’t assume this won’t work. Don’t remain uninformed, find out the answers by doing the analysis. I’m not asking you to send me residents voter registration information. You should have enough information available to you to get a pretty good idea of what a 15% income tax would bring in, share this information with the residents of your county. If you get an idea of what a 15% income tax would be to your county and you don’t believe it will be enough, then take a look at the ways this system proposes to assist your county. West Virginia may have the highest ratio of counties that will struggle to counties that will be paying 15% to the state to assist those counties. But I am sure that West Virginia would do very well. By building large recycling plants, struggling WV counties could serve the needs of several east coast states. The cheap raw materials that this would make available can be used to tremendous advantage. By making CNC equipment and 3D printers available to everyone that wants to experiment with making things, we can stimulate a new era of invention. I can’t do the analysis for the state or any of the counties. Most states would be busting their buttons with state pride at the wealth this would bring. If the federal government didn’t let any of the richest corporations off scot-free or the rich and powerful “non-profit organizations” or the rich and powerful “tax-free charities” i.e. tax havens for the rich and powerful, get away without paying a measly 15%, the federal government could increase the military budget and pay off this obscene debt. This is truly a tax overhaul with incredible advantages built in. The simplicity facilitates a reasonable yet highly profitable price control, any company that claims they must raise the price of a product more than double what it cost them to put the product on the shelf, to make a tidy profit, is simply being greedy. Any politician that claims to be a conservative that doesn’t agree that anything more than a 100% markup is taking advantage of the consumer is adhering to a Victorian definition of being a conservative which is so defined for the sole purpose of justifying the excesses of a monarchy. Claw your way out of that box and allow common-sense to define what it means to be a conservative or admit that you’re a robot. We are not a monarchy and we can no longer rely on the modest integrity of merchants and “Big Pharma” to be reasonable about the pricing of products. FREEDOM; Nothing Grows Without IT!        The Twenty Trillion Six Hundred Billion Dollar National Debt, ($20,600,000,000,000.00) is the reason I wrote this paper. I am not interested in recognition for these ideas, for these ideas are not my own. County government with no smaller governing entities was the original plan of the geniuses of governing that were our Founding Fathers. Our constitution has been with us for over 240 years, we are strong and anyone who thinks it can be done better should look around. This is the most dynamic democratic republic of all time. We are the strongest country in the world, our strength is a direct result of the strength of our constitution. It is our constitution that provides the ability to make changes in the way we do things to solve the problems we face. Our Founding Fathers were intense scholars of thousands of years of governing and the absolute pinnacle of democratic governing, the United States Constitution is the result. They knew that to run a large country, even one only as large as the original thirteen colonies from a central location, is so inefficient that enormous debt is virtually unavoidable. They accepted that, for a period, it would be best to have a strong central government to become strong enough militarily to survive the challenges that most certainly lay ahead. We now are faced with a debt our Founding Fathers could never have imagined possible, let alone that we could still be soldiering on under such a burden, but we cannot continue down this road. We must accept the blueprint our Founding Fathers left for us, as the way to go when the burden of a centralized government became too much to sustain. We have gained the strength needed to be the leaders of the free world. We must stand together now in solemn peaceful unity at courthouses across the country taking precautions to prevent any violence and present the solution left to us as our birthright by our Founding Fathers. freedom; nothing grows without it!                     awaiting farm boy c0-op & feed co. caps ok for use                                                                                           Robert James Casey                                                                                                                                                    134 Creek Rd.                                                                                                                                                           Moatsville, WV 26405                                                                                                                                                   ph.304-457-1995 “THE DEEP STATE” by Jason Chaffetz Paraphrased quotes from the book to get at the meat of it. I hope Mr. Chaffetz will approve.“The governments massive secrecy apparatus as conducted by the federal defense (not national defense, i.e. military) and intelligence agencies…is the very much alive and thriving Deep State. It is about control of information to the American people and the control of the truth.” “…In truth, and perhaps most startling, the Deep State doesn’t hide at all.” At least, it doesn’t hide the fact that it is hiding information! “…the Deep State is intentional, unconstitutional, and organized. It is about pure unfettered power and it gets very angry when it is even questioned.” “…their secrecy” is “…the Deep States greatest strength.”“…parts of the federal government” …are actively working against the will of the people.” “The Deep State has an agenda.” “…if the American people are going to win, Congress is going to have to do things differently, and this book helps concerned citizens understand so they can engage.” Thank you very much Congressman Jason Chaffetz for this fine book at this particular time, it is time, time for the American people to engage. Thank you, sir, for all of the fine investigative work you did in Benghazi for Congress, I’ll say it again, thank you, for sharing this most important information with the public.“…This problem is bigger than we can imagine and getting worse, unless we do something dramatic to wrest back control.”- ‘According to the article by: Damian Paletta and John Wagner “Trump sees a way forward: Shutting IT Down”. “…Steve Bell, a republican former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, said Trump’s call to shut down the government over the (stopgap) problem was merited and could lead to a breakthrough.    ‘I don’t know anything other than a really dramatic statement that could fix this,’ he said.”’“…This problem is bigger than we can imagine and getting worse, unless we do something dramatic to wrest back control.” “Washington, D. C., will hand out more than $4.3 trillion in the next twelve months, or roughly $12 billion per day (including $700 million per day in interest on the national debt).”This comes to $255.5 billion per year in interest on the national debt, nearly half as much as we spend on the national defense of over $600 billion. “The Deep State”; receives a big chunk of this money.  “…I believe the United States of America is exceptional and inspired. I also believe that after 240 years we have an obligation on our watch to provide diligent stewardship. We must pass our country to the future generations better than ever.” “…we have a responsibility as citizens to engage in the management of our government, …”“Government does some good things, but it can also ruin our lives or reach too far into them. Our country’s long-term success includes living within our financial boundaries, limiting government to the powers envisioned by our Founders, defending ourselves with a dominant military, and ensuring accountability …”Donald Trump, “A man who loved America so much he was not going to play the game.” “…Trump, the ultimate disrupter and rule breaker, won an election …And the Deep State, …, is having none of it. Before Trump was even sworn into office the Deep State went into overdrive to thwart his presidency. In agency after agency the threat to big government posed by Trump changed all of the rules.”The Consumer Financial Bureau created in July 2010 and now with 1,623 employees and an annual budget of $605,900,000.00. Transportation Security Administration 2017 budget was $7.6 billion and employs 60,000 people and spent $90 million dollars on highly invasive scanning equipment that are ineffective in making flying safer. After the Department of Defense spent $20 billion to determine the most versatile, most mobile and the best way to detect improvised explosive devices their conclusion was a dog. The EPA has about 15,000 employees and a budget of $6.14 billion. The Secret Service employs 6,500 people and has an annual budget of $1.6 billion. “The DOJ is one of the largest federal agencies, with 116,476 employees who receive a base compensation of $10.24 billion (fiscal 2016). Bonuses added another $29 million.”“The American people are footing a tremendous bill for the federal budget, for millions of employees, contractors, and consultants. The federal bureaucracy is corrupt, dishonest, and out of control. It shouldn’t be, and must not be, if our democracy is to survive.”“…This problem is bigger than we can imagine and getting worse, unless we do something dramatic to wrest back control.” “The Department of Justice is without question a pillar of the Deep State.” “…The DOJ should be protecting us. And yet it is the federal agency that stands head and shoulders above the rest in enabling the Swamp.” “…What is new is the scope and complexity of our federal agencies, entrenched Deep State interests, and the risks we face.” “…The capacity of the Deep State to destroy a president, thwart Congress, and disregard the rule of law has never been more severe or held more potential for disaster.”“We are Americans. We have to fix it. But how?”So, let’s just lump the stopgap problem in with the Deep State problem and kill two buzzards with one stone. We need Donald Trump to do just that, shut it down, but not by refusing to sign a new budget, by standing up to the “Deep State” and telling them all, “Your Fired”! All 2.2 million of them and start over, depending entirely on overt security and making secrecy of any kind in government strictly against the law. President Donald Trump has already begun the process necessary to doing away with covert security by strengthening our southern border and the same should be done along the northern border. But then we must acknowledge the great need of immigration at this time and welcome all who present themselves for citizenship. Even those that are caught trying to sneak in may simply not know that they can walk right in with dignity and openness and experience an easier path to citizenship, therefore, we should still make them feel welcome by providing them with food and water, while being more wary of their motives and making their vetting process more arduous for trying to sneak in. The overt security system that is named for what is generally recognized as the most effective form of defense. Defending the national borders and using sensors to monitor state borders and to provide walk paths to be aware of county borders is called the “Chambered Nautilus” and it is the most effective way to defend against external attacks of any kind and highly effective in isolating internal attacks of terrorism. We must get rid of the “Deep State” and the only fair and fast way to do it is to fire them all. We must be prepared to defend our country if they retaliate, and they will.“The chambered nautilus is one of the oldest creatures known to survive in the earth's oceans.  It is a symbol of nature's grace in growth, expansion, and renewal.  It is also a symbol of order amidst chaos as reflected in its spiral precision.” – Becky Beaton We must renew our commitment to democracy. We must pay off the national debt.“Before one can talk about strategies and policies and programs, you have to have the people in place to enact those policies. You have to have people willing and courageous enough to stand up to the Deep State, to unsettle business as usual.”Unfortunately, we don’t have time for all of that, China is on the fast track to becoming aggressive in its endeavor, to rule the world. We need to force Mike Pence to resign and now that Jeff Sessions is gone, we need to get rid of all the rest of the people Pence brought on board to help him frustrate and control President Donald Trump while he pretends to be his greatest fan. We need someone who will take his place and truly support the president and be right there by his side when he tells the Deep State; “Your Fired!” Someone who will step up and say; “You heard him, pack your stuff and go home peacefully and you will begin receiving your retirement, put up any kind of fight and you’ll get nothing. Have I made myself clear?” Someone like Jason Chaffetz!            “Call it the courage to disrupt. It doesn’t always come in the package or the person you expect, or even hope for. The prevailing theory on advice and consent is that it includes authority to dismiss someoneif they aren’t living up to the duties and obligations of their job. You have a coequal voice to appoint and an equal opportunity to dismiss.” “…I was a little disappointed that a broader group of Republicans didn’t support us.” We need unprecedented broad support to provide a public mandate for the president to fire the Deep State hiring new employees where necessary shuttering all secret intelligence agencies and the majority of other agencies that are not needed. Bloody Benghazi                Chapter 8: “Face-to-Face with the Deep State” plus excerpts from the introduction paraphrased into one presentation of the same information. “He is a lawyer from the State Department who has just arrived from Washington, D.C. He knows nothing about Libya. He is not a specialist in anything remotely having to do with the country or terrorism or the military or conflict zones. He will contribute nothing. His name is Jeremy Freeman and he specializes in Freedom of Information Act requests. When a federal agency hires a lawyer to specialize in FOIA requests, they are not there to facilitate transparency. They are specifically there to keep information hidden from the public … and from a Congressman. It’s a scandal in and of itself that the government is allowed to hire smart, talented people to keep the rest of the government from finding out what they’re up to. He is a State Department ‘minder’ sent here to intimidate witnesses from being too candid. I immediately recognized that his presence would inhibit my ability to get the truth. His job was to suppress the release of information to the public, the media, and Congress. And to use all the legal tools possible to make sure the Department of State and its senior personnel were only viewed in the most favorable vantage light. Every department and agency I’m aware of employs staff to serve this purpose. From my point of view, Freeman’s mission was to spy on a congressional inquiry, suppress information, and intimidate State Department personnel.” “Eric Nordstrom had served the regional security officer in Libya prior to the attack. He had consulted with Legislative Affairs at the State Department about talking to us. Although their job is to facilitate such communication, they told him in no uncertain terms that he absolutely could not meet with us unless they were present. This is categorically false. As a whistleblower, he has every right to meet with us, and they have no authority to stop him. They violate the law by trying to prevent him from coming to us.”“But who is going to enforce that law?” DOJ is a part of the Deep State.“What is it you don’t want Congress to see?”“If they really thought they could challenge me I would lift my phone and say, ‘Hold on, I want to get this on video.’”“Nordstrom would memorably describe the State Department this way:‘For me, the Taliban is inside the building.’”“In the months after this important, initial hearing I would get to know the heroes who defended the personnel in Benghazi. They were literally in a fight for their lives and saved more than thirty others from certain death. Four died,” (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia “…from two coordinated attacks, the first took place at 9:40 PM, September 11, 2012, resulting in the deaths of US Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith. At around 4:00 AM on September 12, the group launched a mortar attack against a CIA annex about one mile away killing CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and wounding ten others. At the behest of the CIA, top U.S. officials initially described the attacks as the results of a spontaneous protest triggered by the recently released anti-Muslim video, Innocence of Muslims.”) “…but others lived. Kris ‘Tonto’ Paronto, John ‘Tig’ Tiegen, Mark ‘Oz’ Geist, and Dave Ubben were heroes that night and are still my heroes today. Dave Ubben in particular was severely injured. Once patched up the other American heroes wanted to go home. Ubben, of course, could not. The State Department told them they were free to go but offered no transportation to return home. No military airlift, no airline ticket, nothing. They were required to get their own tickets at their own expense to get home to their families. To add insult to injury the State Department revoked their security clearances. This is how the State Department treated the heroes of Benghazi. This is how the Deep State suppresses, intimidates, and mistreats people. The Deep State didn’t want them home talking about their experiences, and they certainly didn’t want them to work again in their field of expertise.”            “As secretary of state, Colin Powell had developed a process called Standard Embassy Design, or SED, which used a secure design template for each embassy, saving both time and money.” “…we found that the OBO (Overseas Building Operation, a branch of the Department of State) were building embassies more slowly and more expensively…” “This was costing tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars and slowing down the ability to secure embassies. Some of the old embassies are in bad shape and are not secure.” “…Port Moresby is the largest city in the South Pacific outside of Australia and New Zealand. It has a sixty percent unemployment rate. It is filled with poverty, shanty towns, and serious crimes like murder and rape. It is rated one of the ten least livable cities on the earth. The place is a dangerous horror, and westerners are targeted.” The project began at an estimated cost of $50,000,000.00 (Fifty Million Dollars). They decided to expand and redesign the building, which called for dismantling what had already been done and the project price ballooned to $211,000,000.00 (Two Hundred and Eleven Million Dollars). Can you imagine how much we could do for Port Moresby if we spent $161,000,000.00 (One Hundred and Sixty-one Million Dollars) improving living conditions in the city and how much more secure our embassy would be because of it.“Congress has a right to see everything. In theory. But in practice, not so much.”“The Deep State battle against public disclosure is fought against the FOIA and Congress.” J. Edgar Hoover the man groomed specifically for the purpose of the creation of the FBI to deny the existence of organized crime and gather compromising information on members of Congress is one good reason why they get away with it. The only reason he reigned over the FBI for nearly fifty years is that he intimidated members of Congress with the threat of exposing the information he had gathered on them to the public, which would have ended their careers. James Comey, in his new book “higher Loyalty”, is once again claiming that organized crime no longer exists in this country. Jason Chaffetz may truly believe the words he wrote in the Introduction. “I tend not to imagine nefarious conspiracies in dusty dark corners.”But he goes on to describe a far more convoluted conspiracy than anyone could possibly imagine. If you have ever read about the travels of the unemployed men during the Great Depression from August 1929 to June 1938, then you must notice that the US population, in general, were an incredibly more honest and civilized group of people than exist today, that fact, combined with the fact that the crime rate has absolutely exploded since 1980 while to this day the FBI continues to claim that the crime rate is going down, these facts demand much more of an explanation than: “I tend to see ordinary imperfect human beings and ordinary human institutions, acting too often with greed, fear, and with messy self-interests.”Vice President Mike Pence’s choice for attorney general, Jefferey Sessions.“Meet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss”“…those of us who had been toiling to get documents and evidence from the Department of Justice and other executive branch agencies were hopeful. Perhaps this president could help us break the Deep State impasse….” “The announcement that Senator Jeff Sessions would head up the DOJ was a welcome one. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions was on record criticizing the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s email case. A November 18, 2016, headline in the Washington Post read, ‘Jeff Sessions as Attorney General Could Mean Trouble for Hillary Clinton and Her Family’s Foundation.’”            “With a new sense of optimism, I asked for a meeting with Sessions… I put together a professional presentation outlining all the previous document requests to which the DOJ had refused to respond. By the end of the hour, it became clear this Justice Department was going to be little to no help, same as the Obama administration.” “…I told him”, as a Senator, you “would never put up with this.”      “What had changed?”   Perhaps the Deep State has compromising information on Jeff Sessions and reminded him.            “The leaking of classified or sensitive information intended to promote a political narrative is a problem that has dogged the Trump administration even before day one. Whereas the Deep State had seemed to function in lockstep with the prior administration, it became immediately clear there would be no such support for President Trump.”            “One of the most obvious examples of deliberate sabotage took place before he was even sworn in, FBI director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper appear to have colluded with CNN to release information that would provide a pretext for the dissemination of the Trump “dossier.” The dossier, filled with salacious and unverified gossip about Donald Trump and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, fueled the political narrative that Trump had colluded with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Despite breathless coverage of that conspiracy theory by CNN and other Democratic-friendly outlets, hard evidence has been sparse.            “The release of the dossier in January 2017 ignited endless speculation, but the set up orchestrated by Comey and Clapper would not be known until Comey’s book, “A Higher Loyalty” was released in April 2018, long after the damage was done. Comey admitted in his book that he told the president-elect that CNN had the dossier and was looking for a news hook. With the leaking of Comey’s meeting with the president-elect they got their news hook.”            “Subsequent leaks, designed to damage the president, targeted his appointees and casually compromised the safety and security of the United States and its allies.”            “Within a day of the firing of the White House national security advisor Michael Flynn, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Obama loyalists had been plotting to take down Flynn to prevent him from revealing secret agreements that had been part of the Iran nuclear deal. One anonymous source told the Free Beacon, ‘It’s undeniable that the campaign to discredit Flynn was well underway before Inauguration Day, with a very troublesome and organized series of leaks designed to undermine.’ One White House advisor who was also a member of President Trump’s National Security Council at the time told the Free Beacon, ‘The larger issue that should trouble the American people is the far-reaching power of unknown, unelected apparatchiks (member of a communist apparat. An unquestioningly loyal subordinate, of a political organization.) in the intelligence Community deciding for themselves both who serves in government and what is an acceptable policy they will allow the elected representatives of the people to pursue.”Chapter 12: The Wall: Why the Deep State Doesn’t Want It Built            My explanation for this is because they must undermine overt security to keep the need for covert security viable. They will go to any lengths to maintain the illusion that covert security is required. A migrant caravan of mostly women and children is not an attack on our country. The media reporting that they must pass through more dangerous conditions then they left behind to get to the US, as if this makes liars of them, is ridiculous. It takes a tremendous amount of oppression to cause people to leave their homes and walk away with only what they can carry. If these people are being forced from their homes to serve some nefarious purpose, who is it that gains by it. The Deep State uses it to validate their own existence. US Intelligence is so deeply embedded in Central and South America that movements of this size are almost certainly the Intelligence Communities own doing. They are trying to make the world seem too complicated for anyone to figure out and that it requires such extremely expensive covert security to keep us safe. But it is just an illusion that they use to scare people. “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” –Franklin D. Roosevelt. If we allow them to scare us so bad that we are afraid to act, then we will lose. Immigrants, whether they are legal or illegal, are less of a danger to us then agencies that keep secrets from our elected officials. “We do not have to invade the United States, we will destroy you from within.” – Spoken by Nikita Khrushchev because Chinese leaders never speak for themselves, they always program someone else to make their threats cloaking the true source, not taking any heat, therefore they tend to hide their “nefarious conspiracies in dusty dark corners.”– “You Americans are so gullible. No, you won’t accept communism outright, but we’ll keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you’ll finally wake up and find you already have communism. We won’t have to fight you. We’ll so weaken your economy until you’ll fall like overripe fruit into our hands.” - Nikita Khrushchev. Ms. Dambisa Moyo’s economics research for her book, “Edge of Chaos” proves these words spoken by Khrushchev were put in his mouth by China by proving that China has been highly effective in stacking the deck in their favor economically. And to weaken us through infighting and corruption. These words are dangerously close to being true where China is concerned not Russia though it is clear now that China and Russia will work together. Our constitution is still the law of the land and our Congress is striving to kick down the doors of secrecy but as Jason Chaffetz verifies, the republican Senator that Mike Pence brought to Trump to be Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, is not trying to help. President Donald Trump has demonstrated clearly that he was in favor of transparency on the campaign trail and that he is willing to work with democrats since becoming president, but he needs our help to be freed from the control of John Kelly. “If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may be even a worse fate, you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.”              – Winston Churchill –             Franklin D. Roosevelt’s First Inaugural Address took on an unusually solemn, religious quality. And for good reason—by 1933 the depression had reached its depth. “…This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.”                                 - Franklin Delano Roosevelt -  - HISTORY MATTERS -. We have been in retreat from China for decades, yet all is not lost, we must not let unjustified terror paralyze needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.Chapter 13: Taming the Deep State            “Even before the 2016 election, it was obvious to me that Washington, D. C., and the Deep State that runs it were only going to be fixed by bold disruption. We finally have a president who is willing to do that. He can do a lot – more than anyone anticipated, actually. But as we clearly see, the Deep State is waging all-out war against the president. The president needs Congress, both the House and the Senate, to enact policies to restore our country.” John Kelly as ex-director of Homeland Security labels him a trusted programmer in the Deep State to take over for Mike Pompeo in assisting Pence in controlling President Donald Trump. The first step is to get elected officials into “Third Eye” technology beginning with the president to prove that it is true when we say: “Mr. President, we’ve got your back. Have you got our back?”            “Unless we can find a way to check the power of those who enforce the law, they become a law unto themselves, practically exempt from following the very rule of law they are charged with enforcing.”            The solution is simple, fire them all. It is not practical to imagine that we have time to elect the people that are willing and courageous enough to stand up to the Deep State and to enact policies to tame the Deep State because the Deep States power to control who is nominated by the two parties insures that almost no one that is not already compromised by the Deep State runs for the House or Senate, much less, the president. Donald Trump did it because he chose Mike Pence to be his running mate and the Deep State i.e., James Comey was confident that he could get him impeached. The point is we don’t have time to do it that way because, frankly, it can’t be done that way. Therefore, “We the People” must take Jason Chaffetz words to heart in the Epilogue of his book in the section, Changing Course, on page 222. “As I watched all of this from my vantage point in the U.S. House of Representatives, I came to realize where the power resides. It’s not in the halls of Congress. It’s not in the Oval Office. It’s not even in the darkened corridors of Deep State power. The real power resides with the people of the United States of America. Nothing will change unless we demand it, the Deep State is helpless to override us.”In preparation for, let’s call it “Occupy County Court Yards” we will need permits that allow county residents to occupy the court yards 24/7 and make it against the rules of the permit for anyone from outside of the county to be present. This is a precaution against violence being caused by outsiders as was the case in Charlottesville. It would help if counties worked with DMV to issue official county IDs by requiring participants to bring proof of residence same as required by DMV to be issued a new county residence ID. This could be helpful when voting also. Participants must be united in keeping the peace and willing to work closely with the sheriff’s department to achieve this goal. Fire departments and rescue squads must be encouraged to participate. What we hope to achieve in each county is more residents that get to know more of their neighbors and recognize more of them as county residents. Counties are large and where there are several large cities everyone in the county still will not be likely to get know everyone else but in more rural area’s this certainly will become closer to being true if it is not already a fact of life in the county. The primary long-term goal for staging our peaceful sit-in is to prevent the national debt from going any higher since it is already costing tax payers over Seven Hundred Million Dollars per day, ($700million/day) in interest and rising. We must recognize that it could take years of growing support and increasing determination to achieve the goal our Founding Fathers wrote about in the Anti-federalist papers, which enjoyed greater public support than the federalist papers did. The first step is for all of us to use the technology available to us now (sunglasses with a camera in the center of the frames and a voice activated recorder in your pocket) to discover “Who is programming you, and what are they programming you to do?” It doesn’t matter whether you believe that China is the ultimate source of all programming or that you believe you are being programmed. All that matters, is that you be willing to seek the truth. By taking time to review the audio and video in your free time and decide for yourself. Our first demand from all elected officials is that they wear “Third EYE Tech” 24/7and to provide a live-feed of all of their official business to their constituents. The unofficial time is for their own review to protect themselves from being further compromised by the Intelligence Community and to be available for review to defend themselves against false allegations. Here is the strategy that I propose that the American people sign onto, and demand of President Donald Trump. That President Donald Trump order the National Guard to take over security on the Capital Grounds and at the White House. That President Donald Trump encourage all citizens traveling abroad to return state side to provide cover for the return of our loyal democracy loving agents, so they can begin to gather a comprehensive report on their activities and demonstrate their intellectual skills by making recommendations on how the circumstances they encountered can best be confronted using fully transparent overt tactics. Order all military stationed around the world to surround all embassies to escort all diplomats, US citizens and employees of the embassies that wish to leave to the airport to be taken by military airlift directly to the US. Order all National Guard and Reserves and all enlisted personnel with less than four-years in the service to return with them. Order the rest of the military to concentrate in four areas of the world, Afghanistan, Iraq, North Africa and the Philippines. Order the Navy to be on full alert around the world while concentrating in and around the Philippines, tripling the number of aircraft carrier groups patrolling the shipping lanes in that region. Order all returning military personnel to return to their homes and await further orders for the Reserves and active duty personnel with less than four years to act as a part of the National Guard in their home state. Inform the Governors that the National Guard, Reserves and enlisted personnel with less than four-years will be at their command with the specific purpose of monitoring all locations where a road crosses the state boundary with greatest concentration along interstate highways and other four-lane roads. Their job will be to use drones to record the license plate number of every vehicle crossing the state line until permanent monitors can be embedded in the pavement. Inform the Governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia that their top priority will be to secure the portions of their state borders and the roads that lead directly to Washington D.C. Begin working with Governor Jim Justice for the federal government to rent the use of the White Sulphur for use by members of Congress and their families only, for what it designed to be used for in the event the firing of all federal employees precipitates the necessity for the President and Congress to run the country temporarily from a more secure location with the President and Congress performing all government tasks personally until the President and Congress can hire new help from the private sector. With the fabulous new pay increases for elected officials the federal government will only be authorized to pay for nine employees to assist members of the House, twelve to assist members of the Senate and eighteen to assist the President any additional employees the President and Congress will be required to for themselves out of their fabulous pay. Whether they are lawyers, certified public accountants, executive secretaries, legal secretaries or experts in other areas will be left up to the President and Congress, but they will be all new personnel hired from the private sector and extremely well paid during their limited tenure as a federal employee. This will be the new norm, limited tenure, Congress will have twelve-year term limits and federal employees will have twelve-year limits.Once the country is secure using overt security, i.e. the National Guard, Reserves and all enlisted personnel with less than four years in the service securing each state’s borders with a concentration along southern and northern borders of the country. Then we demand that President Donald Trump fire all federal employees and ask Vice President Mike Pence for his resignation and for Pence to prove his loyalty to the demands of the people by calling on his cabinet picks to also resign. The Attorney Generals from each state will be called to Washington D.C., or to the White Sulphur to select three nominees from the private sector for the President, Senate and House to vote on for the new US Attorney General whose pay will be twice the average earnings of the top 10% of attorneys in the private sector. The new attorney general will begin hiring all new attorneys, legal secretaries and investigators from the private sector to open an investigation of the FBI and CIA files, as well as all other bureaucratic agencies. Investigating and exposing bureaucratic files will be on-going for years. The first new investigation the new Department of Justice will be called upon to undertake is the massive amounts of middleclass wealth that is being syphoned off by private health insurance companies. I recently spoke with a man that said he and his wife’s health insurances costs them more than $20,000.00/year. And he said that they just notified him that they would no longer pay for the one kind of insulin that he has found to work good for him. These companies have been robbing us blind and where has of this money been going, that is the question that the new Department of Justice must find out the answer to as counties take over providing health insurance to the public through Medicare and Medicaid. All money in the hands of public and private insurance companies must be secured as public trust funds that cannot be robbed through bankruptcy or offshore accounts.The directors of the tax departments of each state will be called to Washington D.C., to select three nominees from the private sector for the President, Senate and House to vote on for the new director of the IRS whose pay will be two times the average earnings of the top 10% for certified public accountants in the private sector. The new director of the IRS will begin hiring CPA’s to begin examining the paperwork coming in from the largest corporations for how they are calculating their pricing to adhere to maximum across the board 100% mark-up. Taxes will be far more simple to calculate and keep account of, this will mean that computers can nearly completely relieve the new IRS of having to perform this task, so they can turn their full attention  to monitoring the maximum 100% across the board mark-up. All other federal operations will remain shut down until similar means of pursuing the appointment of new department heads can take place, resulting in the hiring of all new employees from the private sector. The one thing that all of these changes to the federal bureaucracy will have in common is that no one fired will be eligible to be rehired working as a government employee at any level, they will either remain retired, go into business for themselves, or take a job in the private sector.In the near future, only the Embassies in democratic countries will be modified to meet the new Overt Security Embassy Standard which will require that a Company of Marines be assigned to go to the Embassy in advance to determine whether the Embassy can be secured by the Company. The Company Commander will determine what changes are needed to secure the Embassy with all Embassy personnel housed inside and the Marine Corps Company housed surrounding the perimeter of the Embassy. All changes will be completed to the satisfaction of the Company Commander using his own personnel to make the changes when possible and hiring local contractors when necessary. The Company Commander will have an open account to purchase additional surrounding property if the current Embassy grounds are not large enough to construct homes for the company personnel and their families. If it is not possible in the current location to acquire enough property to execute this plan the Company Commander will purchase the necessary, amount of land on the out skirts of the Capital to construct a new highly secure embassy surrounding a 10-acre park-like courtyard with a highly secure satellite communications tower at its center. This highly secure Embassy communications center that automatically records all Embassy communications while insuring that no one can listen in or access the recordings without a federal or military court order as the result of  federal or military court hearings will be developed and deployed by the military as a prototype for secure communication centers to be used in every county in the United States. There will be a two lane road running around the perimeter open to traffic with signs along the road indicating that the property of the US Embassy is open to the public as long as they respect the private homes of the Marine Corps Personnel stationed there and that they should be aware that their every move while on Embassy Property is recorded by stationary cameras and drones and that as soon as they stepped on Embassy property Marine Corps Personnel began monitoring their movements. They should also be informed that if they seek the safety of the US Embassy they can rest assured they have found their way to one of the safest places on earth, and if they need immediate assistance such as water, food or medical attention they need only to kneel down where they are to signal their need for help and help will immediately be on the way bringing fresh water and a small amount of food and they will be transported to the infirmary where, whatever their medical needs require they will receive the finest medical care in the world, albeit some medical care may be provided by robotics but that will only further guarantee the quality and precision of the care. This is how all immigrants entering our country by our northern and southern national borders should be greeted at open walk-through entry gates at maximum one hundred-mile intervals along both borders. As we further develop overt security technology and arrange to house National Guard, Reserves and first four-year military personnel residents of border states along our national borders there will likely be a decreasing need for the actual construction of a physical wall. When overt security technology, along with a physical human and drone military presence is taken to its highest level no covert security or physical barriers of any kind is needed. The people of the small towns of Mexico have brought food and drink and clothing to aid the migrant caravan fleeing unrest so severe surrounding their homes that they have taken to the streets with only the clothes on their backs and what they can carry with them and their families in tow. They have thrown down the gauntlet at our doorstep calling on the people of this great nation, the United States of America to take up the challenge of welcoming our American neighbors in a location where they can all remain together and get the things they need while being vetted with a reasonable amount of wariness but also being provided everything they need. I’d just finished writing this when I looked at the news at 7:30 AM 11/2/2018 and could hardly believe it when I saw Trumps Executive Order to hold the caravan in tent cities. This is great news, this country has enormous wealth and we can do more, we can do better for ourselves and for our neighbors. I also read about the five-month pregnant woman hoping for a bus and I’m sorry, but I just don’t see why we can’t send busses for them now that our president will welcome them by providing tents, there must be thousands of very nice buses that are hardly used that could make the trip. I don’t see why federal courts would object to their being housed this way indefinitely considering the warm climate of our southern border. It is the only intelligent thing to do, to run background checks on them but as part of that background check friends and relatives living in this country should be notified to share information and offer assistance placing them close to people, they know for those that are deemed worthy to move on with their families and seek employment. We need to free up prison space to house refugees from around the world by sending those convicted of murder to live free in an isolated area of the Yukon Territory in Alaska with the understanding that they will not be able to legally leave the territory, but they can have their families join them there and live free developing a county government for themselves. We must release everyone else except recovering drug addicts on home confinement. Each state needs to begin monitoring their own people as soon as it can be arranged, and each county should proceed with plans forthwith to open home confinement ankle bracelet monitoring stations housed in county or regional jails. When each county has its own independent monitoring station, “out-mates” can be more closely monitored than a single central station for the entire country currently located in Texas is capable of doing. This will save the county millions of dollars by no longer housing inmates. There are millions of tech jobs that refugees could begin filling from the security of their cell using a lap top. There will be millions of jobs at every level if people have the courage to stand up to the entrenched bureaucracy in Washington and demand change.“Deep State” “…I wrote this book because we can no longer stand by and let the bureaucrats, the politicians, and the big businesses collude against us. Our power must be asserted in all three branches of government. We’ve allowed the Congress, which represents us more directly than any other branch, to be usurped by unaccountable bureaucrats, self-interested partisans, and profit hungry business interests.” “…We need a government with three fully functional branches. The American people are the only ones who can give it to us.”“Edge of Chaos rings the warning bell…”“…The nature of the role of government has changed with the advent of nonstate actors, and the economic headwinds have become more complex and complicated to resolve within the existing framework of liberal democracy. A world in which democracy is not reformed is grim; more years of unqualified electorates and poor-quality political leaders will lead to worsening poverty and conflict as society becomes more unequal and more deeply split.All the easy choices are behind us. What is left is messy and hard, and proponents of reform are likely to be pilloried and vilified. Evolving to a new democratic structure will be challenging in the extreme. But reform will help ensure that Western democracies retain their position as economic leaders and credible vanguards of the democratic process.Edge of Chaos rings the warning bell regarding the major risks and challenges that the global economy faces and how ill-prepared leaders and policymakers are for the future—in rich countries as well as poor ones. It also lays out in detail what needs to be done to avert a global calamity that will lead to economic impoverishment and chaos. For now, we are woefully unprepared.This book ensures that, at a minimum, the world has been warned. The hope is, of course, for more: that this book will provoke and frame a much-needed discussion about how to restore growth to the global economy and sustain it, so that we can all step back from the edge of chaos.” “WHO WILL TAKE THE LEAD in advocating for and implementing these political reforms? Myopic politicians are unlikely to take on the challenge. After all, supporting a reform agenda that includes term limits would be tantamount to voting themselves out of a job. Weakened by the rise of nonstate actors and reduced budgets resulting from tax breaks for corporations and individuals, politicians are limited in their ability to execute their existing mandate, let alone evolve and change the political system.Those within the existing political system lack the political courage and strength to take reform on. Therefore, the impetus for democratic reform will have to come from outside the system, rather than within it. Specifically, politically minded individuals and those perhaps with a political leadership pedigree (such as retired politicians) who have been put off by the entrenched divisions of traditional party politics and the complex web of career politicians that has locked them out could lead the reform change. So too could nonpartisan institutions such as think tanks.The private sector—both wealthy individuals and corporations—also has an important role to play in the renewal of the democratic process. As discussed earlier, the prevailing trend has been for wealth and power to be transferred away from the state and toward nonstate actors like philanthropists. This has not only reduced the amount of cash available to government but also pushed many aspects of the state’s mandate to provide public goods such as health care and education into the hands of private individuals. According to Oxfam, if he is not outpaced by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates is due to become the world’s first trillionaire by 2042—essentially a personal fortune greater than the governments of many countries. The World Bank estimates that there are fifty-five countries whose wealth is less than that of Bill Gates. As of 2015, only fifteen countries had GDP in excess of a trillion dollars. His scale of wealth also sets him on the world stage in terms of power, allowing him access to and influence over political leaders around the world.The point here is that the shift of power and wealth toward wealthy individuals and away from the government weakens the state. In a similar vein, private corporations have seen their wealth and influence grow over time and importance in lobbying and influencing public policy decisions. Their leverage has increased not only because of the vast taxes they pay toward the government purse but also because of the enormous numbers of people they employ and their involvement in the rollout of infrastructure—such as through public-private initiatives.Moreover, over the past decades, and at the behest of a broader array of stakeholders (government, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs], regulators, broader civil society), corporations have broadened their functions to encompass more than just corporate returns and revenues. They have taken on a whole range of social responsibility initiatives (including education and health), thus again encroaching on what has traditionally been the purview of the state. As in the case of private individuals, this expanding role carries a responsibility to ensure that the political environment in which they operate and make investment decisions is stable and effective over the long term. Corporations rarely take a public lead in political transformations, but nevertheless, given their stature, they should be keen to play an influential role. Many people will be skeptical of the power of citizens and NGOs as a force for political reform, and very likely wary of the idea of corporations making a push to overhaul democracy. Yet an alliance of concerned citizens, NGOs, and corporations could be an important start in the direction toward reform; after all, they all share a common desire to see government operate effectively.The proposals to overhaul democracy detailed here will undoubtedly face opposition from certain corners. The largest opposing din will likely come from those with the most to lose and the most vested in the current system, including the incumbent politicians who thrive in a myopic, ideological world and enjoy the daily attention of media; career politicians with a lack of work experience; parts of the media, since the short-termism feeds its cycle; political activists who cling to tidbits of the latest news, reaction, and polls to feed their campaigns; and of course, democratic purists, who believe that anyone should be allowed to stand for office and vote regardless of qualifications. For the most part, these objections lack legitimacy in that they serve the narrow interests of the objectors and are not in the broader interest of improving democracy at large.There should be no doubt that what is being proposed here is a massive overhaul to democracy as we know it now. Implementing any part of the suggested reform agenda would be a big job even if the suggested reforms were not contentious and there was wide agreement that reforms are necessary. That they will be controversial, and that this consensus does not yet exist, will make the task even more challenging.Nevertheless, it is still worth looking even further ahead. If and when these reforms are enacted, their advocates will need to exercise constant vigilance, monitoring their implementation and ensuring that they are achieving their intended aims…” “When these reforms are enacted, their advocates will need to exercise constant vigilance, monitoring their implementation and ensuring that they are achieving their intended aims.”How to Fix the Great American Growth MachineThe U.S. economy is losing its historic capacity for ‘creative destruction.’ A few key reforms are essential to keep it on top. By Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge 10, 12, 2018Imagine that a version of the World Economic Forum was held in Davos four centuries ago. From across the globe, the great and the good of 1618 gather in the Alpine village: Chinese scholars in their silk robes, British adventurers in their doublets and jerkins, Turkish civil servants in their turbans and caftans. They have come together to discuss the great question of who will dominate the centuries ahead.The Chinese point to their superb civil service and mighty navy. A Turk boasts that the Ottoman Empire is expanding westward and will soon hold Europe in the palm of its hand. A plucky Briton argues that his tiny country has broken with the corrupt, ossified continent and is developing dynamic new institutions, including a powerful parliament and a new sort of organization, the chartered corporation, which can trade all over the world. Yet in the entire discussion one region goes unmentioned: North America.Four hundred years ago, North America was little more than an empty space on the map—an afterthought in educated minds and a sideshow in European great-power politics. The entire continent produced less wealth than the smallest German principality. The U.S. was the first country to be born in the modern world of growth and perpetual change. Today, the United States has the most powerful economy in the world: With less than 5% of the world’s population, it still accounts for almost a quarter of global GDP. America has the world’s highest standard of living apart from a handful of countries with small populations, such as Qatar and Norway. It also dominates the industries that are inventing the future—intelligent robots, driverless cars, life-extending drugs. The fact that 15 of the world’s top 20 universities are based in the U.S. according to the QS World University Ranking, suggests that it is well-placed to dominate the ideas economy.The rise of the U.S. to economic greatness is an extraordinary story. But it is a story with a sting in the tail. Productivity growth in the U.S. has all but stalled in recent years. The number of new companies being created has reached a modern low. Geographical mobility has been in decline for three decades. Economists worry that America’s potential rate of growth—the pace at which annual output can expand without pushing up inflation—is also falling.Why did America become the world’s greatest economy? Why has it lost its momentum in recent years? And what light can history throw on the question of whether the U.S. can be as successful in the future as it was in the past?The key to America’s success lies in its unique toleration for “creative destruction,” the destabilizing force described by the economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942. Creative destruction reallocates society’s resources from less productive pursuits to more productive ones—from spinning jennies to factories, for example, or from horse-and-buggies to motorcars. A range of things, from geography to political culture, have contributed to this enduring preference for change over stability. Consider the sheer size of the U.S., which has allowed it to suck in millions of immigrants and construct continent-spanning companies. It has also allowed the country to shift relatively easily from one industry to another. In Britain, railroads had to make strange loops to avoid ancient settlements. In America, they could carve a straight line from “Nowhere-in-Particular to Nowhere at All,” as the Times of London put it in 1874. The U.S. has sometimes paid a heavy price, both aesthetically and economically, for rapid development, but unlike its European peers, it has avoided chronic stagnation.There is also the fact that the U.S. was the first country to be born in the modern world of growth and perpetual change. The War of Independence began a year before the publication of the greatest work of free-market economics ever written, Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” (1776). For most of recorded history, people had inhabited a society that was static and predictable. Smith advanced a vision of society in which the market transformed the pursuit of individual self-interest into the creation of universal progress. Many European countries took generations to come to terms with this insight (some still haven’t).America was born dynamic.As for the travails of today’s economy, much of it has to do with a retreat from the dynamism of the past. But size and newness are not enough on their own, or else Brazil would be an economic colossus. The U.S. possessed two secret ingredients that turned it into a growth machine.The first is its entrepreneurial culture. Americans admire business people in the same way that the English admire gentlemen and the French admire intellectuals. Americans are more inclined to found companies than the people of other countries and are also better at turning small companies into giant ones. The U.S. was the first country to make it easy to create companies without going cap in hand to local bureaucrats who had a right to tell them what to do. This spirit of entrepreneurship was built into the country’s DNA. The U.S. was founded by settlers who wanted to escape from the restrictions of Europe’s ancient regime: Puritans who wanted to escape from the grip of established churches, younger sons who wanted to escape from the consequences of primogeniture, adventurers who wanted to escape from closed societies. A striking proportion of America’s entrepreneurial heroes have been immigrants or the children of immigrants. Alexander Graham Bell and Andrew Carnegie were born in Scotland. Andy Grove and Sergey Brin were born, respectively, in Hungary and the Soviet Union.The U.S. has also benefited enormously from its founding political structure. The Constitution, written in 1787 and ratified in 1788, did its best to constrain the ability of politicians to interfere in the economy. It limits the reach of the federal government by guaranteeing the rights of citizens, not least the right to property, and by dividing power among its branches and with the states. Though governmental powers to tax and regulate have grown enormously over the past century, they remain a world apart from the state control that has long prevailed among America’s chief rivals.The most remarkable period of creative destruction in U.S. history was the era from 1865 to 1900, when government confined itself to providing a stable environment for growth. Titans such as Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller built the world’s biggest and most efficient companies. Railway barons knitted a continent together into the world’s biggest single market. Though this great revolution was sometimes brutal, it laid the foundations of an era of mass prosperity. Carnegie and Rockefeller reduced the price of steel and oil by almost 90%. R.H. Macy sold “goods suitable for the millionaire at prices in reach of the millions.” Henry Ford trumpeted the Model-T as “a car for the common man.” Their efforts gave Americans a richer diet than their European contemporaries and earlier access to innovations such as electric lights, telephones and cars.As for the travails of today’s economy, much of it has to do with a retreat from the dynamism of the past. The Economist recently found that more than three-quarters of America’s major economic sectors have seen a decline in competition, with the top handful of firms taking an increasing market share. In 1980, according to the Census Bureau, one in eight companies had been founded in the past year; in 2015 (the last year for good data), the ratio had fallen to fewer than one in 12. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 showed creative destruction at its worst. The combination of fear and herd behavior led people to overreact to bad news and to plunge economies into self-reinforcing cycles of decline. Nor did the federal government’s heavy-handed regulatory response to the crisis help matters.Fiscal policy has also hurt the economy. The growth of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare has crowded out the funding of long-term investment in the private sector and in crucial infrastructure such as roads and airports. Millions of baby boomers are retiring and starting to receive benefits while still quite capable of being productive. In 1965, entitlement spending amounted to 5% of GDP. Today it stands at 14% and is projected to increase still more as the baby boomers retire. The relative economic stagnation of the past decade has had serious political consequences, breeding discontent and dysfunction in both parties. While President Donald Trump imposes growth-restricting tariffs and bullies errant companies, Democrats embrace ever more interventionist plans to make companies embrace “social purposes.”The threats now facing the U.S. are bigger than in the past. ChinaFor the first time in its history, the country confronts, in China, an economic power that is even more populous than itself. But America still has a chance to solve its problems, not least because it continues to have a unique genius for business. The most important item on an agenda for reform is to address the fragility in the American financial system exposed by the financial crisis. Financial institutions play a vital role in allocating society’s savings to fund new ideas and new businesses. Consider how venture capitalists have funded Silicon Valley startups, persuading investors to take long-term risks in return for a stake in a potential breakthrough company. But too many recent financial innovations have been problematic, not least because they are so sophisticated that even senior bankers don’t fully understand them. They have increased risk by encouraging financiers to package and sell questionable products, such as subprime mortgages. They have also encouraged financiers to become rent-seekers, more interested in serving their own interests than those of the economy as a whole. The relative economic stagnation of the past decade has had serious political consequences, breeding discontent and dysfunction.In the wake of the crisis, the federal government passed the monstrously complicated Dodd-Frank Act, which tried to reduce risk in the financial system through regulation. A better approach would have been to focus on the amount of capital that banks are required to hold in order to operate. In the run-up to the crisis, banks on average kept about 8 to 10% of their assets as equity capital. If regulators had forced them to keep 25%, or better still 30%, it would have radically reduced the probability of contagious defaults—the root of all financial crises. Today, despite Dodd Frank, they’ve only increased it to a little over 11%. Such a move would greatly increase overall confidence in the financial system. It would allow lawmakers and regulators to repeal the bank-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank leviathan with a clear conscience because any bank losses would be absorbed by shareholders rather than by taxpayers. It would also allow them to focus their energies where they are best employed, in stamping out fraud. The usual objection to increasing capital requirements is that it would suppress banks’ earnings and therefore their ability to lend. But a look at history says otherwise. From 1870 to 2017, with rare exceptions, the net income of commercial banks as a percentage of their equity capital fluctuated within a narrow range of 5% to 10% a year, regardless of the size of their capital buffers. This suggests that a gradual rise in banks’ mandated amount of capital would not damage their rate of return or their ability to lend.“As for the travails of today’s economy, much of it has to do with a retreat from the dynamism of the past.” …Many recent financial innovations have been problematic, not least because they are so sophisticated that even senior bankers don’t fully understand them. They have increased risk by encouraging financiers to package and sell questionable products, such as subprime mortgages.”Based on the recommendations of the distinguished Alan Greenspan we demand that bank regulators require that banks gradually raise their equity holdings at 1% per month to 30% of their assets in equity capital and that the bank-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank be repealed. Furthermore, we demand that it be strictly against federal law for banks to engage in financial practices that cannot be easily understood by the general public. The federal law will state that when banks engage in overly complicated schemes they are acting in violation of federal law, as a result, the board members that voted for them will be held personally responsible for bank losses. Board members will never put themselves in the position of being personally responsible for bank loses, so this will never again be an issue. A clearly stated provision of the law will be that this allows banks to make a judgement call themselves based on complexity with the understanding that if they enter into a practice that they cannot fully and adequately explain their reasoning then they will be required to eat the losses, sink or swim and the wealth of the board members that voted in favor of these incomprehensible, overly sophisticated schemes personal wealth will be the first to be drained to repay investors. We demand that the federal reserve refocus on the three key objectives established by the US Congress for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. We demand that it be strictly against the law for a bank to sell a loan of any kind. When an individual or entity takes out a lone at a bank it must be required that, that bank must hold the loan to the end, whatever that end may be. Banks can no-longer package loans and trade them with other institutions or sell them. When an entity or individual gets a loan at a bank, federal law must guarantee that the individual will always owe repayment of the loan to the bank from which they got the loan, there can be only one exception to this rule, and that is if the bank itself is bought. We demand that it be strictly against the law to sell subprime mortgages. We demand that banks return to the more easily comprehended accounting practices of the sixties and seventies when credits and debits were laid out together in chronological order. We ask that experts in the other areas that are affected by “the monstrously complicated Dodd-Frank leviathan” weigh-in on how a single regulation or a few key reforms might replace another large portion of the Dodd-Frank act. Why do banks get away with charging businesses for accepting debit cards when the card saves the bank money compared to the use of checks? Why does it cost the consumer to use autopay if they have five or less transactions per month when this effects the people who need it the most, usually retired people who have only five or less utility bills to pay each month, that can least afford to have to pay for the service?A second crucial reform would be to get entitlement spending under control. Putting the system on a more sustainable footing could be done by raising the retirement age by a couple of years, indexing it to life expectancy so that the problem doesn’t keep cropping up—and more importantly, in the longer term, shifting from a system of defined benefits to one of defined contributions, as Sweden accomplished in the 1990s. Such reforms would assure long-term solvency, release more savings for productive investment and bring down the federal budget deficit. Nor would the reforms impose great suffering on America’s retiring baby boomers. The retirement age was established in 1935, when the system was set up, at a time when life expectancy was much shorter.The demands already presented do a good job of getting entitlement spending under control where Medicare is concerned while keeping health insurance far more affordable to everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions. The ACA is another monstrously complicated leviathan, and it is destroying middle class savings. Mr. Greenspan and Ms. Moyo both call for raising the retirement age but neither state specific age or offer any alternative age for those of us who do manual labor. When our demands have been met the county will have sole responsibility for Social Security whose only responsibility will be retirement. We demand that retirement age be raised to seventy by the counties, but we also call upon the counties to provide for early retirement starting at the age of fifty due to a disability. America’s problems, in short, are problems of poor policy-making rather than of senescent technology or a lack of entrepreneurial drive. This does not mean that they are insignificant. Unless the U.S. changes course, its economy will continue to flag, holding out the unhappy prospect of a self-reinforcing cycle of low growth and populist rage. Some economists think that the U.S. is mired in a swamp of low growth. We prefer to think that it is trapped in an iron cage of its own making. Out-of-control entitlements and ill-considered regulations are condemning the economy to perform well below its potential. Swamps by their nature are very difficult to escape. Cages can be opened, provided that you have the right keys—and are willing to turn them. —This essay is adapted from the authors’ new book, “Capitalism in America: A History,” which will be published by Penguin Press on Oct. 16.

Together we will determine the course of America for many, many years to come. Together we will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent, thank you.Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another – but transferring it from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people. For too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left, and the factories closed.The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. While they have celebrated there has been little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America today. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this – the United States of America – is your country. What truly matters is not what party controls our government but that this government is controlled by the people. Today, January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement –  the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the centre of this movement is a crucial conviction – that a nation exists to serve its citizens.Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation. An education system flushed with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs which deprive people of so much unrealised potential. We are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, we share one nation, one home and one glorious destiny.Today I take an oath of allegiance to all Americans.For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidised the armies of other countries, while allowing the sad depletion of our own military. We've defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own. And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We have made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, shutters have closed on our factories without even a thought about the millions and millions of those who have been left behind.But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, in every hall of power – from this day on a new vision will govern our land – from this day onwards it is only going to be America first – America first! Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every bone in my body and I will never ever let you down.America will start winning again. America will start winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth, we will bring back our dreams. We will bring new roads and high roads and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour. We will follow two simple rules – buy American and hire American. We see good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their nations first.We will shine for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and untie the world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth. At the bed rock of our politics will be an allegiance to the United States. And we will discover new allegiance to each other. There is no room for prejudice.The bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There is no fear, we are protected and will always be protected by the great men and women of our military and most importantly we will be protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. As Americans, we know we live as a nation only when it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are always complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over, now arrives the hour of action.Do not allow anyone to tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, to harvest the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It’s time to remember that old wisdom: Our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look at the same night sky, and dream the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath by the same almighty creator.So, to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean – hear these words – you will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes and dreams will define your American destiny.Your courage, goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together we will make America strong again,we will make America wealthy again, we will make America safe again and yes – together we will make America great again.Thank you.God bless you.And God bless America. Edge of Chaos rings the warning bell,the world has been warned. . “In December 2010, a poor Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi lit himself on fire to protest the arbitrary expropriation of his goods and his economic future. Within weeks Bouazizi’s act of self-immolation precipitated the Arab Spring revolutions, as under the slogan of “Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam” (“People demand removal of the regime”) protests spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunisia to Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Sudan, and Yemen. Today, that region is in the midst of what some are likening to a modern Thirty Years War.” Was this poor Tunisian fruit vendor a Terrorist or was he simply a human being that could no longer make a living, so utterly frustrated by the changes bestowed upon his country that he felt the need to express his frustration by self-sacrifice?  “At its best,the Western model speaks for itself.”“TO BE CERTAIN, THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS of democratic capitalism are unmistakable. It has proven itself, historically, to be a peerless tool for growth…” “When democracy works, it delivers economic growth and fundamental freedoms in a way that no other system can. And when it fails, it is rarely, if ever, replaced by a system that can do a better job of delivering for its population.”“What went wrong?”“As for the travails of today’s economy, much of it has to do with a retreat from the dynamism of the past.”“Is democracy still the best form of government?”“This is the approach that put food, refrigerators, and televisions in millions of homes. It has fostered and nurtured the innovative spirit that won the space race and put a man on the moon. These are the kinds of concrete, tangible results people want: what they saw, what they envied, and what they believed in.”“The U.S. possessed two secret ingredients that turned it into a growth machine.”“The first is its entrepreneurial culture. Americans admire business people in the same way that the English admire gentlemen and the French admire intellectuals.”“The U.S. has also benefited enormously from its founding political structure. The Constitution, written in 1787 and ratified in 1788, did its best to constrain the ability of politicians to interfere in the economy. It limits the reach of the federal government by guaranteeing the rights of citizens, not least the right to property, and by dividing power among its branches and with the states.”“America was born dynamic.We must create a new path to shared prosperity. One that offers a stable social contract, focuses on raising the living standards of the poor and the disadvantaged, driven by greater economic growth, filled with increased opportunities. One that respects, protects and defends existing small countries, markets and businesses and strives to “lift all boats so everyone wins” and provides only what is lacking. Paraphrased and reworded from Edge of Chaos to make my own statement. “I want to live in a country where the law is not just a word in the dictionary, where people are free to tell what they think; to do what they want; to go where they dream.” “It has been estimated that by 2025 over 80 percent of the world’s poor people will be in fragile, mainly low-income states. This emerging backdrop underscores the urgency of getting the economic and political approach right.”“The hope is, of course, for more: that this book will provoke and frame a much-needed discussion about how to restore growth to the global economy and sustain it, so that we can all step back from the edge of chaos.”“We are Americans. We have to fix it. But how?”“By assessing how to be in the best position to overcome a future challenge.”“WHO WILL TAKE THE LEAD”“As I watched all of this from my vantage point in the U.S. House of Representatives, I came to realize where the power resides. It’s not in the halls of Congress. It’s not in the Oval Office. It’s not even in the darkened corridors of Deep State power. The real power resides with the people of the United States of America. Nothing will change unless we demand it, the Deep State is helpless to override us.” “We the People” of the United States of America must take the lead.”“Today I take an oath of allegiance to all Americans.”“Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another – but transferring it from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people.” “Now we are looking only to the future.”'What truly matters is not what party controls our government but that this government is controlled by the people...whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots'There is no room for prejudice.The time for empty talk is over, now arrives the hour of action.This is your day. This is your celebration. And this – the United States of America – is your country. What truly matters is …that this government is controlled by the people.

I asked my neighbor, John Adams, to pick up a couple of quarts of Burlington’s Famous Apple Butter for me while he was at the festival and the label on the bottle says simply: “Ingredients: West Virginia Apples, Spices,Love, Hope and Prayer”Trumps, trump card!“A pioneer movement is an organization for children operated by a communist party. Typically, children enter into the organization in elementary school and continue until adolescence. The adolescents then typically join the Young Communist League. Prior to the 1990s there was a wide cooperation between pioneer and similar movements of about 30 countries, coordinated by the international organization, International Committee of Children's and Adolescents' Movements (French: Comité international des mouvements d'enfants et d'adolescents, CIMEA), founded in 1958, with headquarters in Budapest, Hungary.” From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia“From age 7, Kasparov attended the Young Pioneer Palace in Baku…”How can anyone imagine that there can be any doubt that when Garry Kasparov first showed signs of being a gifted chess player, he was targeted for more intense training by the KGB to be an undercover agent. It is a fact of life growing up in Russia that he would have been targeted for this purpose and he tells us in his own words how he pulled the plug on the “Anti-Putin” movement in Russia by getting the leaders to take a vacation at the critical moment. Maybe hindsight is 20/20 and maybe confession is good for the soul. I prefer to believe that confession is good for the soul because then I have reason to believe that a fully programmed human robot still has a soul or “Saving Grace”. Unfortunately, this would mean ignoring the fact that this man is a world champion chess player. When you become the level of chess player that Mr. Kasparov achieved growing up in Russia then you are programmed not only to be a communist and an elite communist operative and spy but also to recognize every known chess move outcome possible and the best countermove. The move he brags about making was a simple chess move, it is the people he pulled the plug on that he must fear. Being one of the most elite Russian spies he would be used to briefing Russian Intelligence. That this Russian agent is now a part of the Democrats Centrist movement is a clear sign that the Centrist movement is not more moderate as Republican Brady believes but are in fact at the center of the Hard-Core Left.  “We have entered a period of chaos,” Garry Kasparov says. “Putin didn’t invent the chaos. He just sort of helped it along.” Garry Kasparov has won more than two dozen world chess titles, emigrated twice, and launched movements to oppose two Presidents. Born in Baku, the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, to an Armenian mother and a Jewish father, Kasparov fled that city when anti-Armenian pogroms broke out in 1990. He was twenty-seven years old and had held the world-champion title in chess for five years; he was famous and, by Soviet standards, wealthy. He chartered a plane to Moscow and took nearly seventy people with him.Kasparov announced his retirement from chess in 2005, when he was still ranked No. 1 in the world, and declared that he would devote himself to politics. He started a movement called The Other Russia, a broad coalition united in its opposition to President Vladimir Putin. After a series of street protests and a failed attempt to put Kasparov on the ballot for the 2008 Presidential election, the movement sputtered along until the mass protests of 2011–12, in which the movement’s activists—and Kasparov personally—played a key role. In the political crackdown that followed the protests, Kasparov was forced to leave Russia.He now lives in Manhattan; when he is not travelling for his many speaking engagements, he works in coffee shops. His latest political movement started over coffee, too. Called the Renew Democracy Initiative, it was formed by an ideologically diverse group of journalists, academics, and Kasparov, soon after the 2016 American election; signatories to its manifesto include Laurence Tribe, William Kristol, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Last month, the group published a collection of essays, called “Fight for Liberty,” in which members call for a centrist effort to reinvigorate liberal democracy. On the eve of its publication, Kasparov sat down with me at a coffee shop in Manhattan. (I have known Kasparov socially for a dozen years and have written about him and his work in books and articles; I have also participated in his Free Russia Forum.)This interview has been translated, from the Russian, and edited for length.This is your second attempt at creating a broad opposition coalition.We are asserting that some things are more important than ideological disagreements. The difference is, in Other Russia there were people who accepted our values out of necessity, whereas Larry Tribe and Bill Kristol don’t have a difference of opinion on what democracy is.What is democracy?It is the existence of democratic institutions that enable different people to express their points of view within a legal framework that sets the boundaries of the political process. That’s a very rough definition. We have suddenly discovered that this framework is on the verge of a breakdown. The system of institutions that functioned for two and a half centuries has rusted through, and we have to figure out how it’s all going to work in the twenty-first century. The book that we have just published is an expression of our collective consciousness, an attempt to show that these traditional democratic values can be adapted to the demands of the twenty-first century.How long did it take to feel that you know this system and understand its institutions well enough to take a stab at reinventing it?I’m not really reinventing it. But, (a), I have been living here long enough now, and, (b), I have always been interested in the political constructions of the world. You have to know when to act. Trump’s election was a catalytic event because a huge number of people realized that they have to become a part of the process, they have to vote, they have to protest.I am fortunate to have friends on different sides of the political spectrum. I have another advantage: I am not an American citizen, and I can’t run for office. So, as the chairman of this organization, I cannot be suspected of trying to use it to advance my own political career. I am also difficult to place politically. I guess you could describe me as center-right, but, at the same time, I am a social liberal, and I have a lot of issues with the politics of the right.The two-party system is doomed. It makes the world look too simple, too black-and-white. What’s happening with the G.O.P., and what I suspect will be happening to the Democrats, are reactions to the fact that the rainbow of people’s views in the twenty-first century cannot be fitted into two political parties. Some people remain loyal to the party structure, but those who think more actively start saying, “Wait a second, that’s not what we are about.”We are living through the eighteen-fifties, in some sense. The Democrats split into the North and the South, and this reflected the main issues. But it’s instructive to look at how the Whigs split into Republicans and Know-Nothings. An anti-immigration party! A new political system was being born, even if it did revert to the two-party system. There have been some mighty third-party efforts since: in 1892, in 1912. The system was more complex until it was reduced to a total two-party algorithm. Though, at a few key points, a third force made a difference. In 1968, Wallace ended up helping Nixon by taking votes away from Humphrey. And there was 1992, and 2000—And 2016.Of course. It happens more often than people think. And now the model is crumbling. Europe has been undergoing this process for longer. It didn’t have a two-party system, but it had the socialists and the conservatives, and everything revolved around that. Now we see that disintegrating even in the most stable of societies, such as Sweden.We have entered a period of chaos. Putin didn’t invent the chaos. He just sort of helped it along. Like any dictator, he is an opportunist. There is a war in Syria? Excellent. Obama has washed his hands of it? Great: I go in, displace people, they flee to Europe, this creates problems, the right rises.They had been practicing for this since 2004–05. The Internet structures designed to influence people’s minds were under construction in Russia for ten years before they decided to meddle in the American election. [2004–05 marked the years of the Orange Revolution, in Ukraine, and of a series of protests called the Marches of the Dissenters, organized by the United Civil People’s Front, which was co-founded by Kasparov; both of these developments alerted the Kremlin to the potential of Internet-based organizing.]I suspect that they made a conscious decision to create not a Chinese-type system of blocking access to information but its opposite: a flood of information. They created a deluge. For example, they create entire troll debates. You think that there is an argument raging on the Internet, when in reality it’s a script.When a political system is unstable, something like this can play a serious role. It shouldn’t have been hard to imagine that Putin would decide that, since he has been able to influence Holland, England, Germany, and Italy, to say nothing of Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria, he would try his hand here. But everyone subscribed to the traditional mistaken belief that Putin is a regional player. Considering the resources Putin has, it was obvious that sooner or later he would challenge the world’s strongest country, because that’s his way to demonstrate his own invincibility.How well thought-out do you think this strategy was here?At first, they were using Trump mostly as an icebreaker. They expected Hillary to win and wanted to discredit her completely. Trump was the perfect vehicle for discrediting not only Hillary but the entire electoral system. Putin’s great advantage is that, unlike Soviet propagandists, he is not selling an ideology. I call him the merchant of doubt. His message is; We are shit, you are shit, and all of this is bullshit. What democracy? Trump was the ideal agent of chaos.Trump kept saying that the election will be rigged. This was the Kremlin line. I think their main script was that Hillary would win in a close battle and #ElectionIsRigged would be a hashtag that would discredit her. She would be paralyzed. She’d be facing a Republican congress, which would immediately begin impeachment proceedings.And then they saw that they had a shot at the jackpot. In its last stages, the campaign changed. They started using WikiLeaks when they sensed that they had a chance of getting Trump into office.At the same time, Putin held his annual Valdai Club meeting for foreign experts on Russia, and that year it was designed to build bridges with the Hillary Clinton Administration they were anticipating.Some things take time, even in a dictatorship. Valdai was planned ahead of time. And I’m not saying they had any certainty. Hillary was their main expectation. But they saw that they had a chance. They are card sharks. They stow an ace up their sleeve and keep playing the game.Later, they thought that they may be able to pull off something even bigger. If you analyze what was happening between November and January, during the transition period, you will see that they were getting ready for a grandiose project. Henry Kissinger played a role. I think he was selling the Trump Administration on the idea of a mirror of 1972, except, instead of a Sino-U.S. alliance against the U.S.S.R., this would be a Russian-American alliance against China. This explains the Taiwan phone call. [In December, 2016, Trump spoke on the telephone with Taiwan’s President, Tsai Ing-wen, breaking decades of protocol and earning a rebuke from China.]But it all went off the rails on December 29th, when Mike Flynn called the Russian Embassy. Flynn is a few weeks away from becoming the national-security adviser. And still he calls the Russian Ambassador. He calls to say, “Don’t do anything in response to the sanctions the United States has just imposed.” [The Russian foreign minister, Sergei] Lavrov has already announced that Russia will match the sanctions, Cold War–style: the U.S. has expelled thirty-five people and taken away two buildings, and we are going to do the exact same thing. And then Putin, effectively renouncing Lavrov, says, “You know what, we are starting a new life. We are not expelling anyone, and we are inviting American diplomats’ children to our New Year’s celebrations.”A dictator can’t afford to look weak. He can act this way only if he is absolutely certain that Flynn is speaking for Trump. This means they trusted Flynn absolutely. They were sure that they were going to win in this situation.Are you perhaps overestimating their intelligence? You are assuming that they had good reasons for trusting Flynn.Let’s not underestimate Putin. He follows K.G.B. logic. Remember, when several countries expelled Russian diplomats, Putin went tit for tat. I think he even expelled a Hungarian. And yet he didn’t respond to the Americans that time. He was expecting to win big.My conclusions come from looking at Kissinger’s trip to Moscow and, from what I see, his long-standing connections to Gazprom. It was obvious that China was being distanced and Trump was ready to give himself over to Putin. They were readying the ground for denouncing NATO Article 5. This is the picture I get when I add it all up.So why did it go off the rails?I think it was the F.B.I. They knocked Flynn out, and then it wasn’t going to work. [On January 12, 2017, the Washington Post reported that Flynn had called the Russian Ambassador. The report was apparently based on an intelligence leak—the F.B.I. had been listening in on Flynn’s conversations with the Ambassador.] It turned out that the American political system has a certain reserve of stability; ironically, this stability is currently guaranteed by the intelligence services and the Pentagon. While the Republican Party has given itself over to Trump, the institutions that were always suspected of dictatorial tendencies are the ones resisting dictatorship. I think that at that stage they opted for all-out sabotage.And that was about the time when you decided to step in.I realized that we had to set some of our disagreements aside, because the very framework in which we could have these disagreements was under threat. I recently read Churchill’s book about the interwar period, “The Gathering Storm.” He talks about how the Western world stood by and watched as the forces that led to the catastrophe grew in Germany, but also in the U.S.S.R. and Japan and Italy—they kept thinking that it would just dissipate.How useful do you find comparisons to the nineteen-thirties?Why wouldn’t they be useful? Historical comparisons are always contingent and can be slippery, but they are necessary because they enable us to understand the nature of mistakes. Everybody says, “How can you compare Putin to Hitler?” But which Hitler? The Hitler of 1936? Sure, you can.What are the similarities?Hitler was a respectable politician in 1936. Attempts to boycott the Olympic Games in Berlin had failed. Everyone came. It’s important to remember that Hitler had not always been as he was in 1941. Any dictatorship, including the Stalinist one, is formed over time. It’s not a military coup. It’s a gradual press.In 1935, when Hitler decided to take over the Saar Basin—perhaps if France had sent a military division there, things could have gone differently. A dictator never asks, “Why?” He asks, “Why not?” Putin is also annexing territories gradually. He tests the waters. He didn’t venture into Syria right away. The chemical attack in 2013 was a sort of test. It showed that he can intervene there.Ukraine was also a test. [Immediately following the Olympic Games in Sochi, in February 2014, Russian troops invaded Ukraine, occupying the Crimean Peninsula and establishing a puppet separatist regime in the eastern part of Ukraine.] That went over just fine. Putin’s dictatorship is different from twentieth-century dictatorships in that it is driven primarily by money. It’s not imperialism in its purest form. He doesn’t have the desire to attack and conquer everyone. He has no ideology. He sows chaos: break up NATO, break up the European Union, create chaos in America. In the end, he is concerned only with maintaining his own power, and his own power depends on demonstrating his might and uniqueness to his own guys, his own henchmen and cronies.What do you think of comparisons between Trump and Putin?Their backgrounds are different. Putin is not a public person; he is a K.G.B. agent. He is underhanded in everything he does. Trump acts openly and brazenly. Sure, he has to disguise things, but he does that by piling on lies and fake information. I think Trump envies Putin his ability to do things that Trump can’t do by definition. Putin doesn’t have to be concerned with the media or with parliament. Trump resents wasting his precious time on speaking to the press. And then he has to push things through, lobby for them—all that takes time. I think the way Trump acts around dictators comes from his feelings of a sort of inferiority: he’d like to be like them, but he can’t. If he is reëlected, it will be a tragedy—nothing will rein him in.What specifically are you worried about?He will do what he wanted to do and hasn’t been able to yet. He can destroy NATO. He can push the situation to the point of chaos.You started by talking about institutions that are not holding up. But a lot of people are looking around and saying, “It’s been two years and the institutions are still standing.” What do you think?That they are still standing shows that they were built well. But we have learned many things, such as how much of the institutional cement is actually tradition. In everything Trump does, he uses the loopholes of the system, and we see how many of them there are. Many things began long before Trump—for example, the shift of power from the legislative to the executive branch.The Supreme Court situation is extremely dangerous. When Trump said that he would stick with Brett Kavanaugh all the way, I wrote that his saying so was a small problem; the big problem is that Kavanaugh will stick with Trump all the way. For the first time we have a Supreme Court Justice, a fairly young one, who is not only partisan but loyal to the President who appointed him. Now imagine the following setup: Democrats have taken Congress and have started investigating Trump and issued a subpoena for his tax returns, which is something they can only do on national-security grounds. Trump challenges the subpoena, and the Supreme Court issues a 5–4 decision. Is that going to be legitimate? Imagine any 5–4 decision involving Trump in which Kavanaugh casts the decisive vote.The Supreme Court is the institution that saved America in 2000. Everyone realized that the election was a dead heat, but the court decided. Now imagine a repeat of 2000 in 2020. What will happen in the streets? How can this institution pass final judgment?Distrust in the system is growing. It’s important that Kavanaugh was confirmed by fifty votes that represent forty-four per cent of the country.So there seem to be three things you want to reform: the two-party system, the balance of powers, and the federal system.It’s not that I want to reform them. Let me put it this way: a country that has legitimately elected Trump has to consider its political system. How could Trump have won an entirely legal election? If I’d suggested this was possible three years ago, people would have laughed at me. But something is going on.Something besides Russian interference?Absolutely. Putin gave things a nudge, but the process was under way. And it may be that we are lucky it was Trump. It might have been someone worse, with more-rigid ideological concepts. Trump’s goals are ultimately personal: he is a businessman. He has no ideology that could plunge the country into a long-term catastrophe.I was just leafing through a book called “The Wonderful Future That Never Was.” It’s a collection of articles from Popular Mechanics, from 1903 to 1969. People were predicting so many different things—the country was boiling over with ideas. Now try reading what people are saying about what will happen in ten or twenty years. We have gone from utopia to dystopia. Trump is a reflection of our unconscious, in a way. People fear the future, and then a man comes along and says, “I’ll take care of everything.” We have to find a way to restore our spirit of exploration.You are raising two children here now.Three of my children are here, but Polina, who is twenty-five, is a graduate student in philosophy. So, I am raising two, yes.They are twelve and three. Are you not afraid of the future?I am an incorrigible optimist by nature. The future is a self-fulfilling prophecy. I believe this firmly. I am fervently in favor of resuming space exploration. We have to start living in the algorithm of exploration again. That’s what made this country what it is, and the world, too.What made you move to New York?I moved here permanently in Februar, 2013. I had to. [My wife] Dasha and I had been living here sporadically since 2004. We had a place here. Aida was born here, in 2006. We were paying taxes here. But, when you get a call from the Investigative Committee [Russia’s central detective agency], asking you to come be interviewed as a witness, you realize you have to give it some thought. The late Boris Nemtsov knew this well, so he used to say, “When you enter as a witness, you exit as a suspect. If you exit at all.” Too bad he didn’t heed his own advice. [Nemtsov, a Russian politician and Putin opponent who had been threatened repeatedly with prosecution, was assassinated, in Moscow, in 2015.]What was the investigation?It was one of the cases stemming from the protests of 2011–12. I happened to be abroad when we got the call, and I never went back.Soon after, you started the Free Russia Forum, an organization for political activists in exile.In December we are going to hold our sixth conference, in Vilnius, Lithuania. You say that it’s an organization of exiles, but it’s actually about fifty-fifty: émigrés and people coming from Russia. I am always amazed at the civic courage of the people who come from Russia, because this is a gathering that Channel One covers as a congress of the enemies of the people.It’s still growing. Marat Guelman is starting to organize a culture track. [Guelman is an art curator and former Putin campaign strategist living in exile in Montenegro.] Ideally, this sort of discussion would be happening in Russia. We organize a live broadcast so that people in Russia can watch something that they ordinarily can’t access. We talk about the sanctions. This time we are going to talk about the church schism. We talk about Putin’s wars. We talk about how the state should be constituted and we discuss the mistakes of the past. It’s important to look back on the last twenty-five years. What happened that led to the 1993 Russian Constitution, which virtually made Putin inevitable? We need these kinds of discussions so that if a window opens up—as I think it will—we have an accumulation of intellectual capital that will allow us to avoid making the same mistakes.What kind of window do you see opening?Dictatorships fall unexpectedly. There are many things that can go wrong: we don’t know which way the Syrian conflict will go, and the sanctions are starting to make them feel the squeeze, and the oligarchs are malcontent, and the country is reforming the retirement system.The church schism is a very serious topic. In effect, it constitutes the end of the Russian concept of religious autocracy. An 1686 decree guaranteed Russia’s primacy in the Orthodox world. Now Ukraine, Belarus, and a couple of Russian regions are splitting off—they are returning to Europe after three hundred and thirty years.In other words, Russia is being isolated. The world’s attitude toward Putin has finally changed. You can see that when the minister of defense of the Netherlands says that they are in a state of cyberwar with Russia. England has stopped just short of saying that. And even in America, Trump hasn’t proved to be that useful: sanctions keep putting the squeeze on. I’m not saying the sudden collapse of the system is going to happen tomorrow—it might take a year or two, but less than five, I’m sure.I recall that when you and I spoke in 2006, you were sure that the system was at the edge of collapse.There was one thing I couldn’t predict, and that’s the amount of money that flowed into Russia following the financial crisis of 2008. The West addressed the financial crisis by printing a giant amount of money, and a lot of that money went to Russia, as payment for oil. Also, to be honest, I had overestimated the West’s ability, or, rather, its desire, to intervene in Russia. Back in 2007 it was still possible to influence Putin. He wasn’t yet the Putin of 2014. Russia was more integrated into the world.Then there was 2011. One of the reasons the protest movement choked up was that there was no discord in the élites. Élites split when they can see that the rest of the world wants change. But in reality, the world didn’t want things to change. And now the outside world itself is unstable.But don’t you think that the reason no cracks appeared in the élites has to do with the nature of a mafia state, which makes everyone dependent on the don?I don’t think things were so clear in 2011. How dependent were these people? They keep their money in the West, after all. I can imagine a scenario in which things would have worked out differently. But that would have required more decisive action on the part of the protesters.If you had to do it over again, as one of the leaders of the protest, what would you have done differently?I think we had a chance on December 24th. [On December 24, 2011, more than a hundred thousand people came out in Moscow and in dozens of other cities and towns around Russia, comprising the third and largest protest in three weeks.] The special forces were hiding out in the pedestrian underpass. No one was prepared to take responsibility for dispersing the protesters. In Moscow we had a hundred and twenty thousand people in the street. We had the option of laying siege to the building of the Central Election Commission and demanding that election results be annulled. Another was the Maydan option. [Maydan means “square” in Ukrainian. Kasparov is referring to protests in Kyiv, in 2004 and in 2013–14, when months-long occupations of the city’s main square succeeded in toppling the government.] I think we could have gotten ten thousand people to stay.Instead, we went on holiday break. Leaders of the protests took their planned vacations; I came to America to see my kids. Our mood was, we’ll come back and come out again. We should have maintained the revolutionary momentum. On February 4th, we had an even bigger crowd, but, by that time, they were prepared for it. They’d plugged up all their holes, put a stop to any internal boat-rocking. They did their job, and we didn’t do ours.They cracked down, but now their scorched-earth approach is going to backfire. Whatever protest comes next, it will be spontaneous and will come out of nowhere, or everywhere at once. And it will seem like all of that is happening without the opposition doing anything, because they’ve eliminated the opposition. The thing is, young people keep coming out to protest. They’ve forced me out of the country, they’ve killed Boris Nemtsov, they’ve been jailing Alexey Navalny. And still things are happening. That means there are things that people want that the regime can’t give them.You really are an incorrigible optimist.I’m not saying that I know how it ends. I just said that the system is unstable. That doesn’t mean that things will be good tomorrow. There are different ways they can play out.I believe that anything is better than Putin because that eliminates the probability of a nuclear war. Putin is insane. He is an aging paranoid dictator who may be losing power. Anyone who replaces him, any new system, however ugly it may be, will aim to reach some understanding with the West. They have their financial interests, if nothing else. The greatest danger today stems from Putin, both because he is uncontrollable and because his staying in power serves to encourage the worst impulses of all the Saudi, Arab, and other dictators. So, if Putin goes, that will be a positive.Back in Russia, you had a team of bodyguards and you consumed only food and drink that had been kept securely. Do you feel safe here?Safe? No. But what can I do? I walk the streets, but I don’t have tea with strangers. And I don’t accept invitations to countries where the government may be motivated to make a friendly gesture toward Putin. I get enough invitations to countries where I’m not under threat.Tell me about your chess work.That’s the fun part. Fortunately, in America there is a city called St. Louis. And there is the Sinquefield family, and Rex Sinquefield, whose Saint Louis Chess Club spends millions of dollars a year to promote chess. There is a children’s chess boom in America. You don’t see it on television but it’s there. I work with them a lot. Twice a year I hold sessions for gifted children.I want chess tournaments to be a commercial enterprise and chess to be a professional game. For now, I feel optimistic. I play a little bit when I go to St. Louis. But I realize that I can’t compete with the leading chess players today.Are you doing them a favor by playing?No, I enjoy playing. It’s a place where the chess culture is like it used to be in the Soviet Union. Everyone there respects the game. That makes me feel comfortable playing there, even if I know that I can no longer win.How does the greatest chess player in history feel being unable to win?You can’t really maintain the level of concentration. I can play a strong chunk of a game, or I can win one game in a beautiful way. But, on the whole, that’s not my life anymore. You can’t come from a different life at fifty-five and beat a thirty-year-old, or even a forty-year-old who does nothing but chess. I’m an amateur, and I feel comfortable with that. Masha Gessen, a staff writer, has written several books, including, most recently, “The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia,” which won the National Book Award in 2017.Fight for LibertyWhat's InsideThe Renew Democracy Initiative began in the months following the 2016 American presidential election. Three of us met over coffee to talk about what might be done to counteract the troubling trends we had seen playing out over recent years: the degradation of civic dialogue, the erosion of faith in basic institutions, the denigration of expertise as “elitism”—and a resurgence of political authoritarianism and extremism.This resurgence, of course, did not begin or end with the US presidential election and the strong populist currents it revealed on both sides of the ideological spectrum. Nor was it confined to the United States. Across Europe, separatist movements and populist parties were gaining traction. Strongmen were ascendant from Turkey to Russia to the Philippines. Fanatics and terrorists continued to pose a global threat.Our small group expanded rapidly. Our concerns were widely shared by members of both the left and the right searching for common ground in a new center. The growing threat from all sides to what used to be called “liberal democracy” had sounded an alarm bell.Traditional bipartisan consensus is under assault on issues including free trade; a system of alliances and the postwar, rules-based order; and the need for political compromise. Even more troubling, confidence in democratic institutions and the individual rights they exist to safeguard is failing. The rise of a new illiberalism has launched a wave of nativism, isolationism, militant identity politics, and hostility toward dissenting views. It is crowding out and undermining the spirit of freedom, meritocracy, and tolerance that characterizes the most cherished ideals of liberal democracy.It is the Hard-Core Left that displays “hostility toward dissenting views” and zero tolerance for traditional Christians who believes GOD (defined as: The get down on your knees awe at the way nature provides.) got it right in the Bible (The Word) when THE WORD claims that sex between two men is abomination in the eyes of God: Leviticus 18:22 says, “[Men] shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.” What people will have difficulty with until “the enlightenment” is discerning the truth about history from the lies propagated by China when it has practiced genocide and changed the historic record to its goal of total world control.We have assembled a coalition of diverse voices—writers, diplomats, statesmen, artists, entertainers, business leaders, academics, lawyers, a Nobel laureate, even a certain chess champion—from around the world to defend these “first principles.” At the Renew Democracy Initiative, old points of division—marginal tax rates, health-care reform, military spending—have faded quickly into the background as we focus instead on how much we have in common: a belief in the fundamental ideas that for generations have made so much of the world free, prosperous, and safe. But shared beliefs are not in themselves sufficient. They must be defended, and this demands action.What step to take first? Should we start a new political party—internationally engaged, fiscally responsible, socially tolerant? A new think tank? One of our founders, Bret Stephens, argued that ideas were at the forefront of any serious change. And, indeed, those who care deeply about these first principles of liberty and democracy have not been vigilant enough in defending them, in articulating why the siren song of the demagogues, extremists, and cable news talking heads is dangerously wrong. Believing in the principles of liberal democracy is not enough. It is essential to communicate why these principles have improved lives wherever they have flourished and why they are still the best hope for spreading prosperity and security in the future. So short is the collective memory of fascism, communism, and other forms of totalitarianism that many young people today no longer consider living in a democracy to be important. The situation is urgent.And so RDI came into existence—an effort to reinvigorate democracy from the ground up, based on common ideals and ideas. Our goal is to remind, to educate, and to advocate for liberty. This book, inspired by the Federalist Papers, is our inaugural publication. The essays collected here lay out first principles, describe the most serious threats to liberal-democratic values, and outline solutions to meet those threats. We have no partisan agenda; we embrace any citizen, of any political persuasion, of any nation, who values these principles.“This book, inspired by the Federalist Papers, …” What about the Anti-federalist that enjoyed greater public and stronger backing by the Founding Fathers but was supposedly only temporarily set aside so that the central government could gain the needed to face the extreme challenges that everyone agreed were certainly on the horizon. The moneyed interests defeated the popular interests much as they do today. A centralized democracy is far more easily controlled than a decentralized democracy this is why China uses the moneyed interests to bend any nascent democracy toward greater centralization.“The real safeguard of liberty is education.” - Franklin Roosevelt -“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,” Ronald Reagan warned. How to preserve it? Franklin Roosevelt illuminated our path when he said: “The real safeguard of liberty is education.” Education, that is, about the principles that inform the politics and values and processes of democracy. RDI (Renew Democracy Initiative) seeks to inspire whomever we can, wherever we can, to help create a cultural and political climate that stirs pride, not alarm. So, join us.

After his election to the presidency in November 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt received a talkative friend. If FDR could rescue America from the Great Depression, the caller said, then Roosevelt would be remembered as the greatest of presidents; if he failed, then he would go down as the worst. There were live alternatives to democratic capitalism afoot in the world: European fascism in Germany and Italy, Soviet Communism in Russia. Roosevelt responded matter-of-factly: “If I fail, I shall be the last one.”And so, to some extent and some degree, we’ve been here before: a sense of crisis, of crumbling order, of facing destructive forces that may prove beyond our control. America and its allies survived the 1930s and World War II not least because FDR did not fail. For all his shortcomings—and they were legion—Roosevelt was, however, a rare spirit. “Men,” the New York Times wrote after his death in Warm Springs, Georgia, in April 1945, “will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House when a powerful and ruthless barbarism threatened to overrun the civilization of the Western World.” Such an encomium seems unlikely when the newspaper comes to assess the life and legacy of the forty-fifth president.When we get the unconstitutional deeply secretive institutions adored by the Hard-Core Left, as well as, the Alt-Right Vice President Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo and supported by the CIA infiltrated media out of President Donald Trump’s head and he is able to say and do what he decides for himself to say and do then we will begin to see the results that will elicit such praise as the NYT bestowed upon Franklin Roosevelt: “Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House when a powerful and ruthless barbarism threatened to overrun the civilization of the Western World.” It is, in fact, the same source of powerful and ruthless barbarism that threatens to overrun the civilization of the Western World today. Winston Churchill was talking about the same enemy when he said  “If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may be even a worse fate, you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.” The Alt-right, the Hard-core Left, the media are deeply compromised by the FBI and the CIA, two unconstitutional institutions that do not believe in liberal (liberal with no sexual connotations) democracy and they will not promote it. Franklin Roosevelt was fortunate that J. Edgar Hoover had not achieved the level of influence in the thirties and forties that he had in 1963.The issue at hand, though, is larger than any single figure. Once thought to be firmly entrenched in the Western world, democracy—or at least the democratic norms we have taken for granted since the crisis of capitalism in the 1930s—is under global assault. The essays collected here survey the scene with dispassion and clarity. From Putin’s Russia to Trump’s America (the two, alas, have more in common than is even remotely comfortable), freedom of speech and of the press, the rule of law, fair play in the marketplace and in the movements of ideas and of people across borders, and confidence in the integrity of the governing classes are all in danger. The forces of authoritarianism, nativism, and kleptocracy are ascendant. The concerns that have prompted this project are not those of a single news cycle; neither are they driven by partisan animus or by an ad hominem obsession with the current occupant of the Oval Office. The contributors to this book are motivated by fact, not ideology; by reason, not passion; and, crucially, by hope, not fear.The essayists are working within an old and important American tradition, one articulated by Frederick Jackson Turner, the great historian of the frontier. “Other nations have been rich and prosperous and powerful,” Turner wrote nearly a century ago. “But the United States has believed that it had an original contribution to make to the history of society by the production of a self-determining, self-restrained, intelligent democracy.” In 1944, the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal, writing his landmark The American Dilemma, quoted the African-American Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ralph Bunche in an effort to define an American creed. “Every man in the street, white, black, red, or yellow,” Bunche observed, “knows that this is ‘the land of the free,’ the ‘land of opportunity,’ the ‘cradle of liberty,’ the ‘home of democracy,’ that the American flag symbolizes the ‘equality of all men’ and guarantees us all ‘the protection of life, liberty and property,’ freedom of speech, freedom of religion and racial tolerance.” For Myrdal, such a definition of human liberty and of aspiration gave the American creed global significance. “And even the skeptic,” he wrote, “cannot help feeling that, perhaps, this youthful exuberant America has the destiny to do for the whole Old World what the frontier did to the old colonies.”These fine words rang true and can again but the accumulation of facts that follow the CIA  and the FBI make them difficult to accept as true today. The CIA as the promoters of totalitarian dictators because dictators make better business partners and their involvement in the world drug trade that brands them as “The Drug King Pins to the World” gives us a bad name in the world. The FBI has branded itself as murderers of American citizens based on unsubstantiated allegations rather than supporters of the “Rule of Law and Due-Process” from Ruby Ridge to the Branch Davidians the list of murders of American citizens is long and contains some of most exceptional personalities our country has produced giving our citizens good reasons fear them.So, it has largely proven in the decades since World War II. Now a variety of factors has put the Western experiment with liberty in jeopardy. Self-government in the American mold, with its roots in the parliamentary and common-law traditions of Britain, was always understood to be the most fraught and perilous of undertakings. “Probably, prudence, wisdom, and patriotism were never more essentially necessary than at the present moment,” George Washington wrote in the early autumn of 1788. In a letter to the Marquis de Lafayette a few months later, on the cusp of assuming ultimate power in the young republic, Washington emphasized, “Nothing but harmony, honesty, industry and frugality are necessary to make us a great and happy people.”The key insight of the founding fathers—one that has informed every successive generation—was that such virtues are not always in abundant supply. Hence the checks and balances of the constitutional system and the emphasis on the cultivation of republican virtues. “National passions and habits are unwieldy, unmanageable, and formidable things,” John Adams wrote, and the point of divided sovereignty, the rule of law, and a free press was to give reason a fighting chance in the perennial struggle against the appetites and ambitions of the factions of the moment. Due to the significant results of the CIA’s MK Ultra program the factions of the moment are aligning themselves with the powerful and ruthless barbarism of China and encouraging the only democracy strong enough to weather the headwinds blowing out the lights of freedom to turn toward “the most fraught and perilous of undertakings” by taking the stepping stone to communism down the parliamentary pathway to the politburo and when you arrive and expect China to smile down on you for assisting them in taking control of the world you will realize the mistake you made when you are forced to your knees in front of a pile of rotting sculls. When Garry Kasparov sees Vladimir Putin kneeling next to him, he’ll realize the road to communism ends in China and their paranoia tells them that loyalty to anyone is “the most fraught and perilous of undertakings”.The unavoidable truth of the matter is that passion is gaining the upper hand on reason in too many ways, in too many countries—including America. There are sundry causes for the crisis of the hour, and the essayists here explore not only the underlying forces driving the current discontent but also offer possible solutions. It is not the work of a day, or of a week, or of a single election. Recovery and restoration, rather, require constant vigilance and perennial devotion.History is an ally in this struggle, for an empirical, commonsense case can be made—and must be made—that liberal democracy has always grown stronger the wider it has opened its arms. One sign of the strength of the system, in fact, is the ferocity of the reaction against the infrastructure of liberty in the first decades of the twenty-first century. The forces of fear are mighty, but the armies of hope and of equality of opportunity have much to draw on in this fight.In the twilight of his life, Franklin Roosevelt, one of the most accomplished purveyors of hope in American history, recalled the words of his old Groton School headmaster, Endicott Peabody: “Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights—then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward, that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend.” It can be difficult to recall that fact in the maelstrom of the moment, but it is a fact—and, as John Adams reminded us long ago, facts are stubborn things.Jon Meacham is a distinguished visiting professor at Vanderbilt University. His books include American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House, awarded the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 2009. PART ONE: First PrinciplesLiberal democracy has flourished because it is undergirded by certain basic values. These values merit fresh discussion to help reinvigorate them in the battle against illiberal forces now spreading across much of the world. In today’s supposed post-truth moment, the first step is to assert the seemingly obvious: truth exists, truth matters, truth must be defended. The Enlightenment—progenitor of liberalism and the veneration of individual freedom—was fueled by reason and by the search for its soul mate, truth. To demean and discredit the idea of truth is to attack the foundations of democracy itself.The reassertion of other liberal-democratic first principles will also help counter the illiberal tide: Individual liberty is not a “Western” concept, nor is it reserved for only those particular peoples deemed capable of appreciating and defending it. Economic freedom nourishes the expression of all other freedoms. The valorization of civics and civility is essential to discouraging the spread of hatred and partisan extremism that hobbles democracy and invites exploitation by demagogues. Globalization knits nations together in peace and prosperity, buttressing liberal democracies and turning a spotlight on freedom’s blessings; economic nationalism accomplishes none of this. Finally comes a distinguishing characteristic of democracy that is a standing rebuke to illiberalism everywhere: the toleration of dissent.The Need for Truth: ROGER SCRUTON“There are no truths,” wrote Nietzsche, “only interpretations.” True or false? If true then false, hence necessarily false—false under every interpretation. That ought to have been an end to the matter. In fact, it was only the beginning. Not long after Nietzsche made this declaration in the late nineteenth century, relativism began to gather momentum. Faced with a world in which people acknowledged rival authorities but no shared method of discussing them, many were tempted to abandon entirely the old distinction between the true and the false. What you say is true from your point of view, was the mantra, what I say is true from mine. Hence there is no disagreement, no conflict, nothing to be resolved, and no way of resolving it in any case. Truth, fact, reality—all such notions were relativized, and the search for the objective standpoint, from which the evidence could be assessed, and the facts determined, was abandoned as delusory.“Cultural relativism,” as it was called at first, looks like a positive step toward toleration. On examination, however, what seems like the acceptance of difference shows itself to be the opposite. If there are no facts, if people cannot judge or be judged save from their own point of view, then all that we say, think, or do is beyond external criticism. Nobody has grounds to protest or to argue, because to do so would be to impose a point of view that has no authority for the person being criticized. All people exist in the bubble of their own opinions and are granted the absolute permission to be who they are regardless. In which case, all people are a potential threat to their neighbors.Human beings will continue to want those things—possessions, comfort, survival—that power alone can secure for them, and in pursuing those things they will continue to be in competition with the rest of us. If there is no truth, then we cannot accommodate and conciliate our conflicts by agreement, because the idea of agreement suggests a cooperative search for the facts. A world without truth is a world without trust, and in particular without the trust between strangers on which all societies ultimately depend. Take away trust, and you take away all that makes it possible to tolerate difference and to build together with your neighbors a shared form of government.That a priori argument is not without empirical support. In the emerging “post-truth” culture of young people today, we find an extraordinary burgeoning of intolerance. If there is no truth but only opinion, opinions become the shaping force of social identities. People begin to define themselves in terms of them, and to create networks of conformity where they feel safe among people like themselves. Social media encourage their users to approach opinion in that way. Opinions are part of you and not to be judged. Opinions, like selfies, are things that you share.The search for safety goes hand in hand with suspicion of the intruder. Hence social media abound in expressions of malice and belligerence toward those who challenge the opinions of the day. When young people find themselves in an academic milieu where thinking is required of them, their first instinct is to escape from all rival forms of thought. In countless universities in the Western world, we have seen students preventing the expression of unwanted opinions, at the very same time as affirming the dogma that there is no objective standard from which any opinion can be judged. Truth has gone, but power and identity remain. And the contest is fought without any possibility of compromise or conciliation, because those both depend upon the belief that there is a fact of the matter and that it is the purpose of discussion to discover it.Before the advent of social media, the biggest boost for the flight from truth came from the universities themselves. Since the 1960s, humanities departments have surrendered to a wave of relativist scholarship, some of it originating in Paris at the time when the postwar baby boomers knocked the old scholars from their perch. Structuralism, poststructuralism, and deconstruction had a viral effect on the French curriculum, consigning all ideas of objectivity to the trash can. And, in a similar development in America, the once respectable “pragmatism” of William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey was recycled as an attack on the very concept of truth. Pragmatism came to denote the view that truth is “what works,” where “what works” means “what works for me.”The scholars who fostered this post-truth culture tended to come from the left. But they may have unwittingly helped create the milieu in which Donald Trump has flourished. His thoughts, attuned by their very nature to the limits of a Twitter account, make no distinction between the true and the false, and assume that no one else makes such a distinction either. Should the FBI show that Trump colluded with the Russians in manipulating the presidential election, that would not be a fact but simply “fake news,” of no greater authority than his own homegrown alternative, which will have the added advantage of being contained in a tweet, so that we can read it quickly and move on.The president owes his election in part to the astute use of social media, themselves the most powerful instruments in the demotion of truth from its once exalted position in the human psyche. We have yet to get used to the damage done to rational argument by the Internet’s conversion into one great seething cauldron of opinions, most of them anonymous, in which every kind of malice and fantasy swamps the still, small voice of humanity. Maybe someone will create software that will worm through the system, systematically deleting all that is false and destructive. But until then we live in a post-truth culture.An influential proponent of this culture, Michel Foucault, argued that behind every practice, every institution, every system of belief lies power, and that the goal of the historian is to unmask that power and to liberate its victim. Foucault originally described his method as an “archaeology of knowledge” and his subject matter as truth, suggesting that truth and knowledge were the goals of his inquiry. But, in his seminal 1966 work Les mots et les choses (published in English in 1970 as The Order of Things), he made clear that “truth,” for him, would always appear in scare quotes, because “truth” is the product of “discourse,” and discourse the voice of power. Foucault’s “truth” does not exist independently of the opinions that give voice to it but is created and re-created by the prevailing discourse. Hence, there are no received truths that are not also convenient truths, and truth itself has no existence independent of the political structures that it serves.In a series of striking books, Foucault showed—to the satisfaction of his youthful readers—that the entire understanding of the world on which French postwar society had been built was simply a mask for the power of the bourgeoisie. “Truth” has no authority outside the social structures that are propped up by it and that in turn prop it up. The whole castle of illusions will come tumbling to the ground just as soon as a rival discourse replaces the old “truth” with a new “truth” of its own.This is not the place to explore all the ways in which the concept of truth has been marginalized by thinkers like Foucault. But one thing is sure: students who have suffered three or four years of Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Richard Rorty, and Slavoj Žižek are not likely to believe that there are real truths about the human world and certainly not that it is the business of a university to discover them. On the contrary, they will come away from their studies in the same condition as they began them, acknowledging no distinction between truth and opinion, and confident that their own opinions are the right ones because they are shared by everyone in the same “safe space” as themselves.The fact is, however, that truth is an indispensable concept, as necessary to the advocates of a post-truth society as to its opponents. Moreover, it is a concept that is more securely founded than any other. Language itself testifies to this. There is no way of expressing an opinion without the implicit assertion of its truth; the first moves in dialogue—“yes,” “no,” “I agree,” “you are wrong”—are ways of establishing a shared commitment to truth. Those who tell lies depend on the distinction between the true and the false, and on the human capacity to engage with it. Our outrage at being lied to by politicians, misled by preachers, and corrupted by seducers is the outrage felt by truth-directed creatures when others have set a trap into which the truth seeker is likely to fall.Scientific theories aim at truth, and it would be impossible for science to proceed except by conjecture and refutation. To refute a theory is to show it to be false, and even if there are philosophers of science like Paul Feyerabend who believe that any scientific theory can be retained in the face of the evidence, no practicing scientist takes them seriously. The scientific community is founded on debate and challenge, and you cannot debate if you think there is no truth to be aimed at.Nor is science some isolated sphere to which old-fashioned and eccentric ideas of objectivity retreat from the surrounding intellectual disorder. In every sphere where there is genuine thought and real opinion, the laws of logic apply. All who think are obliged to stand by the implications of what they think. But one proposition implies another if the first cannot be true without the second being true. Logic tells us that every proposition p is equivalent to the proposition that p is true. We cannot reason if we deny the law of noncontradiction, which tells us that p and not p cannot both be true together. At every juncture we encounter the absolute and all-pervasive nature of the concept of truth, which guides our thinking even when it is never mentioned. It is a concept so deeply implanted in the human psyche that only sophism can have any force against it, and those who take refuge in these arguments will not stand up for long.All this needs to be said now for two reasons. One, as mentioned, is that the relativizing of truth, which seems to its advocates to be a form of toleration, is in fact a recipe for conflict: it closes the door to the very possibility of dialogue. Failure to discuss our differences is a sure way to enhance them, and the first result of the post-truth culture has been the “no platform” and “safe spaces” habit of the modern campus. Post-truth culture is not the friend of toleration but its enemy.The other reason is that, without the concept of an objective reality, human beings adopt a posture of retreat. In all areas where decisions are required, people lose confidence that there is either a real objective goal or a sure method of pursuing it. Everything becomes veiled in hesitation—a syndrome that can be observed in the very language of so many young people today, for whom all expressions of opinion and decision come padded with “like,” “sort of,” “basically,” and “whatever.” The outgoing, definite, and courageous person is a rare product of the post-truth culture, yet one on whose existence the future of society depends. Without such people the democratic process, in which real and urgent issues are confronted in a spirit of open-minded discussion and a preparedness to accept the facts and act on them, will be jeopardized. If so, many young people today are losing the sense that the democratic process matters, it is surely in part because they are losing the capacity to take part in it, not knowing what the point of discussion might be. The first goal of a university education should be to impress on them that truth exists, that it is distinct from mere opinion, and that we discover it by arguing with those who dispute what we say.Sir Roger Scruton is a professor in the Humanities Research Institute at Buckingham University in Britain and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, DC. His books include On Human Nature, Notes from Underground, and Confessions of a Heretic.To overly scrutinize this purveyor of the truths writing, this knighted victim of the parliamentary way is to run the risk of losing the ability to ever have another logical thought. That’s why I quit reading his blither blather back about half way through it.Values Without BordersELIZABETH COBBSA reproach of our age is that “the West” foists its beliefs on other regions of the world. This is like claiming that biology teachers foist an interest in sex on teenagers.History shows that values considered Western are not. It is patronizing to assume otherwise. People around the world have the same stake in conflict resolution, democracy, and free markets. Starting around 1648, quickening in 1776, and culminating with the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, multitudinous nation-states replaced a handful of empires. Today they number nearly two hundred. The global system to which they belong enjoys transnational norms that have dramatically increased life expectancy. That’s something everyone values.I thought of down loading the Centrist Manifesto and the communist manifesto to compare them but after reading this I feel certain that the Centrist Manifesto contains just as many idealistic lies as the communist manifesto. Moving on, we might take look at history to discover the mistakes that have brought us to the “Edge of Chaos” for “History is an ally in this struggle, …” and even though the West experienced tremendous economic growth from 1945 to 1985, a lot of damage was done and by looking back we can understand why and learn how to avoid doing more damage.  “In the twilight of his life, Franklin Roosevelt, one of the most accomplished purveyors of hope in American history, recalled the words of his old Groton School headmaster, Endicott Peabody: “Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights—then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward, that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend.” It can be difficult to recall that fact in the maelstrom of the moment, but it is a fact—and, as John Adams reminded us long ago, facts are stubborn things.”To substitute truths for facts in the words of John Adams: Truths are stubborn things. Many truths have survived the peaks and valleys of history and when man is enlightened to the truth of history, we will discover that it was China that drug us through the valleys for the sole purpose of destroying the truth and rewriting history to further their goal of total world control. Now, as the United States of America and the world teeters on the “Edge of Chaos” it is the fine work of the Founding Fathers, the United States Constitution, the level of decentralization that we did achieve in also having fifty state constitutions, the three branches of government and enduring commitment to education that holds back against the growing pressure of the unconstitutional secretive bureaucracy that feeds China our highest level technological secrets. This secretive bureaucracy is the reason our elected officials have fallen into gridlock caused by the inability of the Republicans and Democrats to work together to achieve bipartisan solutions, as US voters run from one side to the other the candidates presented for election become more extremely conservative on the right adhering to a Victorian definition of conservativism that promotes the complete liberation of businesses resulting in the ruthless and corrupt form of capitalism that has stolen the 160 acre land grants from thousands of small farmers and turned it over to rich non-citizens that now own thousands of square miles and treats the animals with total disrespect. This ruthless form of capitalism brought us the malls that destroyed small towns and has led to ever larger businesses. This ruthless form of US capitalism has given way to ever the ever more ruthless globalism that labels anyone that stands in its terrorists and attacks them destroying governments and driving hundreds of thousands of refugees from their homes and causing humanitarian crises of starvation around the globe. All of this has played directly into the hands of China, because China has been orchestrating all of it through the existence of secret agencies, whose creation China has manipulated in countries around the world.When US voters run to the left and elect democratic liberals, we find that Democrats adhere to a definition liberal that has extreme sexual connotations defined by the gay community that was started by China thousands of years ago when they discovered that forcing this behavior on men caused extreme self-hate. During WWII individuals like George Soros saw the way the Gestapo targeted gays for genocide and drew the exact conclusion that China wanted people like Mr. Soros to conclude, that gays were a legitimate natural occurring part of society that suffered unjustified abuse. Their abuse was certainly unjustified, but their behavior is not natural and does occur naturally. They were being victimized when they were manipulated into this behavior by German State psychology and then they were victimized for being victims. Germany has a very long dark history of being a puppet state of China. China never shows loyalty to those that have delivered entire countries to its control even when doing so could have been carried out with virtually no chance of revealing China’s complicity simply because of the extraordinary paranoia of the Chinese leadership. Marie Antoinette is a prime example of someone who unknowingly delivered France to the results extreme debt that led to a national revolution that resulted in the overthrow the monarchy. China could have spared Marie Antoinette’s life without exposing their involvement but for them, the greater certainty lay in leaving to face the guillotine. Pope Francis could do the world a great service allowing a carefully monitored but thorough investigation into the contents of  the Vatican archives. The world awaits “THE” enlightenment! Democrats when they get into office takes the passive stance militarily exposing the US to China taking a more aggressive route to taking the reins of world power, while expanding government and running up the debt. But Republicans love it when they have ever more government that they blame the democrats for, while manipulating it to run up the debt even more and bilk the middle class out of its wealth. The Affordable Care Act is a prime example of this, and then the republicans give vast tax breaks to the rich which do further damage in both ways, running up the national debt and bilking the middle class of its wealth. The two extremes we are experiencing in this country are the results of secretive bureaucracy manipulates elected officials through the use of compromising information.The National Emergency that the US faces is because the most vital portion of our national defense is not under the Department of Defense and the continuing loss of our highest technological secrets must be curtailed by firing all 2.2 million federal employees. The highest levels of technological advancement must be our only national secrets and the Pentagon needs to recognize that far more truth in intelligence gathering can be gained by videotaping interviews with refugees and immigrants than by accepting interpretations from unconstitutional secret agencies that do not believe in our form of government and are exposing our people to grave risks. Mr. President, “We the People” need your full and total commitment to our democratic republic and the United States Constitution.  We believe you when you say you want to restore democracy in Venezuela, but we fear the CIA and the FBI do not want to see democracy restored in Venezuela or anywhere else where democracy is being undermined. We have two weeks till the shutdown to end all shutdowns and we need you to make some preparations by offering Cerberus a security contract to do analysis of incoming information from recorded interviews of refugees, this will be our primary source of overt intelligence gathering. Cerberus will also be called upon to provide recommendations on the use of drones and other technology and troop deployments to secure the borders of Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Feinstein should be offered the most lucrative security contract in history if he agrees to live stream all activities by all of his people and all of the drones used to fulfill this contract to the Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to the Pentagon and to the oval office. There must be clause directly preceding his signature that if he or any of his people makes an effort conceal any official actions associated with this contract that he and his company will be in violation of the terms of the agreement. Quotes from “Edge of Chaos” by Dambisa Moyo from the end to the beginning.Thank you very much Ms. Dambisa Moyo for this fine book at this particular time, it is time, time for the American people to engage. Thank you, ma’am, for all of the fine investigative work you did on world economics, I’ll say it again, thank you, for sharing this most important information with the public.“Edge of Chaos argues that liberal democracies of the sort prevalent in the West simply cannot deliver this (economic) growth without substantial reform.”Chapter 7: Blueprint for a New Democracy“‘GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE me death!’Uttered in 1775, Patrick Henry’s famous words have, over the past two centuries, echoed within political movements around the world, expressing what billions of people have come to believe: that freedom is the most cherished value of all—and should be at the core of every modern political and economic system. Patrick Henry’s utterance has so resonated that it appears in national anthems and mottos beyond US borders. Uruguay’s anthem, “Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba,” includes a similar statement, “¡Libertad o con gloria morir!”—Liberty or with glory to die!—while “Liberty or Death” (Eleftheria i thanatos) is the Greek national motto. It has taken over a century to convince the world of the merits of democratic capitalism and the freedoms these economic and political systems offer. And yet today, skepticism regarding these systems is at a fever pitch at home and abroad, with many now doubtful that these systems can deliver the human progress they once promised.Over the past decade, Western democracies have been the source of considerable political volatility (with the rise of populism amid disaffected voters), mounting economic uncertainty (emanating from the financial crisis), and worsening prospects for strong economic growth (as the economic headwinds detailed in Chapter 3 gather speed). This unsettling backdrop has brought into sharp focus the urgent need to objectively and critically reassess the limitations of democracy in its current form.Indeed, the skeptics are right. Democracy must adapt or further decay.With this threat in mind, this chapter presents ten radical reforms intended to revive the quality of political decision making in democracies, enhance civic responsibility and voter engagement, and ultimately forge a democracy where politicians will pursue, and voters will support long-term policymaking and fresh approaches to achieving economic growth. The proposals described here will not be easy to implement. Some may find them unpalatable or even downright objectionable. Nevertheless, they map out a path to combating the myopia that plagues democracies around the world.The proposals offered here fall into two categories. Some are targeted at politicians and political institutions, and others are targeted at voters themselves. They include making it harder to repeal legislation, reducing the frequency of elections, implementing term limits, requiring officeholders to have nonpolitical experience, mandating voter participation, and instituting minimum qualifications for voters.” (I am for the blue, against the red and neutral on the ones in black. I am incorporating some of Dambisa Moyo’s reforms into this document. I am requesting county commissioner’s assistance in delivering this document to the other county commissioners in your state and that you request that the National Organization of County’s distribute this document to all county’s. I am requesting that county commissioners print this document to be distributed to your county residents to allow them the opportunity to read it. I intend to list each demand in the form of a petition so US citizens can sign up on each demand that you agree with, at the end you will be able choose to sign up for only those individual demands you previously signed up for, or you can choose to back the full package despite the fact that you had not signed up for every demand. There will be a third choice at the end of the petition for those who have read this paper and intend to sign up in support of all demands so, you won’t have to sign each one. Please take an active role in our democracy to keep democracy alive.)“These recommendations are intended for mature democracies like the United States, the nations of Western Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia, for these countries have the most to lose if democracy fails. They represent the viability of the democratic system, and their example has persuaded many others around the world to adopt democratic principles and values with great success. As standard-bearers of democracy, they must now demonstrate that it can be resilient, not by remaining unchanged but by adapting so as to once again offer a model of economic success and continual human progress. More generally, countries across the emerging world that adopt and pursue democratic principles should also heed these recommendations as they seek to embed effective democracies for the long term.These proposals may be met with skepticism from those who believe that whatever the time, whatever the question, the answer is always more freedom, not less. (Those who believe, the answer is always more freedom, do not believe in the rule of law, they are anarchists, they believe only the strong should survive. Which proves that even too much freedom has a dark side. Those who believe the answer to economic problems is always more globalist capitalism, presents something similar in which only global monopolies can succeed and in which labor is simply viewed as a commodity resource to be transported where it is most needed at the whim of the global authority. I don’t want to get too negative with your writing ma’am, I love your book.) Yet it is important to recognize that unfettered liberty carries with it costs that are weighing down on economic prospects of the world. These proposals would restrict the behavior of politicians, limit the options available to voters, and, indeed, narrow the scope of the electorate itself. But these are necessary constraints at a time when politicians and voters too free to act have acted too often in shortsighted ways.  AS WE HAVE SEEN, POLITICAL decision making in liberal democracies has prioritized political outcomes today over economic outcomes tomorrow. What follows are seven proposals aimed at altering the actions of politicians to make them more effective long-term policymakers.” Binding the Government to its Agreements to Rise Above Political Short-termism:“First, policymakers should bind their governments and their successors more firmly to policies. A key problem with government is time inconsistency—the fact that policies committed to and enacted by an incumbent are routinely unwound, thereby creating policy uncertainty, which in turn hurts investment and ultimately impedes economic growth. Put another way, it is the tendency of the preferences of incumbent politicians to change over time in such a way that today’s decision makers’ choices become inconsistent with past plans and commitments. Binding the government is a solution to the problem of time inconsistency.” I am going to skip a lot of the examples that you can read in her book, grouping her proposed solutions more closely with the problems, Ms. Moyo writes for democracy’s in general while this document targets the changes required here, in the US. Using purple to delineate my writing and to make the demands that I hope you will agree must be presented to President Donald Trump as a signed petition for a citizen mandate for changes to the US government. Changes that can and must be made without altering the constitution. This will require great determination and commitment from a supermajority of the citizens of the United States of America, “We the People”.“…the goal should be to set extremely high hurdles for policy repeal, thereby reducing high policy turnover and short-termism. The crux of the concern here is that multinational agreements and their provisions must remain in force more tenaciously than is currently the case.” Demands for Binding the Government to its Agreements Promptly: When the president signs an agreement, the House and Senate are required to thoroughly research the agreement in preparation for ratification, which will be at the top of the agenda automatically, the next time the House and Senate meets, so that a mandatory vote can be taken before moving on to other business. This will also be true when a supreme court justice is nominated by the president. Ratification and conformation of a supreme court justice will require a 60% majority. If an agreement gets less than 40% approval in the House or Senate the president must get a consensus of the members concerns for ways, the agreement can be modified before a new agreement can be signed. The president can initiate the repeal of an agreement, but a 67% supermajority of the House and Senate will be required to repeal a ratified international agreement. There will be no effort to do anything that requires a constitutional amendment. When a president has signed an agreement, the agreement will automatically be the first order of business until it is either ratified by 60% majority or failed by getting less than 40% approval, but the president has no authority to withdraw from an agreement his predecessor has made, once signed the president is out of it unless the president wishes to pursue a new agreement that is in limbo. A supreme court justice is an extraordinarily powerful official in our government, and it must be required by law that the House must also vote with a 60% approval for a supreme court justice to be confirmed relying entirely on the questioning process in the Senate to cast their vote that is automatically at the top of the  House and Senate agendas. If a nominee gets less than 60% approval in the House or Senate the president must present another nominee. The nuclear option will cease to exist. 60% majority will be the minimum requirement for passage at all times. Supermajority will be defined as 2/3rds majority to significantly raise the bar for repeal of a ratified international agreement. What we demand are federal laws that Congress adheres to out of respect for this citizens mandate petition and to prove that this statement that Ms. Moyo makes is true.“At its very core, mature liberal democracy reflects a contract between government and its citizens.”Campaign Finance:“After binding the government, the second major reform has to do with campaign finance. Democracies must implement tighter restrictions on campaign contributions so as to reduce the disproportionate impact of wealthy voters in determining election and policy outcomes. Many democracies already cap the amounts individuals and corporations can contribute to politicians and require transparency regarding where campaign funds come from. However, additional reforms are needed, particularly in the United States, where vast sums of money flow to politicians through campaign contributions by wealthy individuals and businesses. At least $2 billion was raised to support candidates in the 2016 US presidential election, and over $6.8 billion was spent by candidates running for federal offices that year, much of it on television advertising.” The extreme divide between the two-party system and the shenanigans of the DNC where Bernie Sanders is concerned requires extreme measures to get the US back on track. The two-party systems involvement in the primaries must end, and all campaign finance must be provided by federal, state or county government with receipt verification of how every penny was spent with all money not accounted for, returned. All monetary contributions from the private-sector to the public-sector must end. I will use presidential elections as my example and all other elections, and the amounts allocated to the candidates will be based on recent averages at that level. All presidential candidates will be allocated $100 million each by the federal government to be used during the primaries. All candidates will be officially deemed independents and there will be no voting along party lines because parties will no longer play any official role in the electoral process. Voters in the primaries will be presented with a list of candidates to choose from and each voter will choose one candidate. The three front runners will be allocated one billion dollars each by the federal government to be spent on the general election. Candidates will no longer choose a running-mate to be vice president, the second-place candidate will be deemed the elected vice president and each candidate must be prepared to accept the role as vice president based on the outcome.Higher Pay for Elected Officials:“Third, in order to improve the quality of lawmaking, officeholders should be paid salaries competitive with those of private-sector leaders, as well as performance bonuses. In the private sector, higher compensation—via higher salaries, bonuses, or other perquisites—is thought to act as an incentive for higher-quality performance. But few nations apply the same principle when it comes to compensating lawmakers and other leaders.”  “The issue of politicians’ pay is pertinent to the effectiveness of democracy and its leaders in at least two ways. First, large pay differentials between private and public sectors can lead to the public sector struggling to attract and retain the most talented people, who are instead drawn to higher-paying opportunities in the private sector. The gap between the pay of political leaders and corporate leaders has widened. (paraphrased) For example, average CEO pay in the United States…was...$15 million a year, in 2013. by comparison, the US president earned $400,000 per annum, 2016…” Second, “The revolving door problem can be mitigated by restricting politicians from accepting private-sector roles for at least a full electoral term after they leave public office—a ‘pay them more and shut the revolving door’ approach.” “…increased pay …and more stringent revolving-door rules can help to restore the stature of public-sector work and engender much-needed long-term thinking among public servants. Moreover, a clearer delineation between public- and private-sector work would also mean public policymakers will become less susceptible to lobbying and horse-trading favors on a company-by-company basis. If politicians are adequately compensated, they need not fall prey to the allure of private-sector compensation and will be more at liberty to focus on unbiased and effective long-term policymaking.” Ms. Moyo writes about bonuses while pointing out several ways they can be problematic, and I believe that adequate pay is all that is necessary. I hope you agree. The President of the United States of America must be paid at least double average CEO pay, therefore the president will be paid $30 million per year. Senators will be paid $25 million per year, Representatives will be paid $20 million per year and Supreme Court justices will be paid $15 million per year, not because the supreme court justice post is less important than the House or Senate, it isn’t, it is arguably a more important post than the president, but because they have life terms. Jason Chaffetz suggests shutting the revolving door for two years in his book and Ms. Moyo suggests five to seven, therefore the people demand a four-year across the board lockout of the private-sector after leaving office.  Longer Terms for the House of Representatives: “A fourth way to discourage politicians’ short-term thinking is to alter electoral cycles so as to lengthen politicians’ terms in office. The goal of such a change would be to better match political attention spans to longer-term economic challenges, and specifically to match political cycles with the length of the business cycle.” “…If politicians’ terms in office lasted roughly the same amount of time, policymakers would be incentivized to implement policies that would deliver growth over 5–7 years and beyond, rather than 1–3 years.”“…The extension of terms should be accompanied by the imposition of term limits—the fifth crucial reform to mature democracies.” “…Any politician granted a position of authority or power for multiple decades risks slipping into complacency and reduced accountability.” The House will serve for 3 years until 2021 and then they will serve six-year terms. This will offset their elections by 3 years from Senate elections. Both the House and the Senate will have a two-term limit for a maximum of twelve years. Term limits for supreme court justices is not a problem. The concern should be the quality of the people nominated. Each of the 50 states has a supreme court and I believe the country would be better served if we gathered the state SCJ in Washington to nominate 3 candidates from the private  sector to serve as a USSCJ they believe are qualified experts in constitutional law but not necessarily an attorney. Minimum Standards for Holders of Public Office: “The sixth reform is a more discriminating approach toward who is eligible to vote (perhaps she meant run). “In order to combat career politicians, democracies should set minimum standards for holders of public office, requiring candidates to have work experience outside the political realm—not only in business but in a range of “real-world” jobs, so that politicians collectively bring to their work a greater understanding of the workings of all aspects of the economy and society.” “…People with real-world experience, on the other hand, are more likely to understand the sorts of policies that are needed in a modern economy than those conditioned on a diet of polls and political tactics.” “…Democracies should aim to encourage the election of politicians who are not merely political but have nonpolitical experience and who will be more likely to focus on long-term economic outcomes.” “The United States, with its minimum age requirements for federal officeholders (thirty-five for a presidential or vice-presidential candidate, thirty for a senator, and twenty-five for a representative), already implicitly demands that candidates possess some measure of life experience, though it does not delineate between political and nonpolitical experience.” “…Particularly in the case of the United States, it would be difficult to implement additional restrictions on officeholder experience without an outright constitutional amendment, which would take time and a sustained political campaign.” “…Another way to increase the chances of higher quality and more motivated politicians taking office is to ensure that elections are competitive and that candidates are responsive to voters with a wide range of political views. Thus, the seventh recommendation for reform would push for democracies to reduce the number of uncontested, or safe, seats in legislative elections.”“At its very core, mature liberal democracy reflects a contract between government and its citizens.”As I have stressed throughout this document, amending the US Constitution is not an option. I believe that the fabulous increase in pay will bring more and better competition and no further measures will be necessary. Although, there is a great deal to be gained by having mature leaders at the top and working your up. What we demand are higher age limits at the state and federal levels, as well as, term limits on the state level and no term limits or age limits at the county level, only that a candidate for Mayor be required to have served one 6-year term as commissioner of that county before being eligible to run for county mayor. Minimum age of 35 for state Governor, House, Senate or State Supreme Court Justice with two 4-year term limits at Governor and two 6-year term limits in state congress. Minimum age of 50 for House, Senate, President or Supreme Court Justice. I would just point out that by raising the minimum age, we are still adhering to the minimum age requirements of the constitution, we are simply exceeding them. Certainly, this sort of interpretation of the constitution would require USSC approval. What this will mean is that an intelligent well-respected youth might drop-out of school at fourteen and run for county commissioner and be elected and after one term as commissioner he might be elected mayor of the county. Based on their achievements they might continue to be the mayor for two terms, at 32 they may return to school and they might choose at age 35 to run for state congress, they might serve 12-years in the state house, 6-years in the state senate and run for governor at the age of 53, moving on after four-years as governor to become President of the United States of America at 58, while having been a school drop-out. There are all kinds of scenarios that might be imagined with one common factor, you must work your way up. “All mature democracies suffer, to some extent, from uncompetitive elections and could stand to work to further incentivize electoral competition. Uncompetitive elections are particularly a problem in the United States, where district boundaries are often drawn by political incumbents to strengthen their own hand (and in so doing weaken their political opponents) rather than strengthen the political process itself. This sort of gerrymandering means politicians need only persuade their own party faithful, essentially disenfranchising large numbers of voters. According to Pew Research, “since 1992, 93 percent of House members who actually seek re-election have won.” For example, in 2014, there were 19 seat switches between the major parties of the 435 contested seats. The solution is to change electoral boundaries to minimize the number of safe seats. In North Carolina, for example, campaigners for “Fair Maps, Fair Elections” are seeking to reform the election map of their General Assembly, to reduce “bitter partisan divisions and promote public confidence in the political system.”  Campaigners favor the Iowa model of redistricting boundaries, which ensures “no political influence in the redistricting process” by excluding partisan politicians from decision making regarding electoral boundaries. Instead, the Legislative Services Agency, a nonpartisan body of civil servants, redraws districts after each census without regard to partisan political advantage.To improve outcomes, electoral boundaries should be redrawn with the aim of encouraging competitive elections and partisan balance. The Iowa approach is one way of pursuing engaged and competitive elections. The purpose should be to maximize competition between different political candidates; there could be scope to move beyond the Iowa model by not just favoring competition within political parties but by actively favoring competition between political parties.Fully contested elections help to keep incumbent politicians accountable, holding their feet to the fire on the quality of their economic policies and decisions. This would incentivize the elected official to deliver higher-quality economic policymaking that is based on consensus and matches the needs of all residents by appealing to the widest array of voters rather than narrow interest groups. Essentially, the more competitive an election, the greater the pressure there is for the incumbent to deliver on economic promises in order to win the seat.The debate in political science over the connection between gerrymandering of voting constituencies and political polarization is enormously fraught. Although it seems intuitive that less partisan districts would produce more competitive elections, which, in turn, yield better economic policymaking, it is hard to find empirical evidence that makes a causal link between district boundaries and economic outcomes. In the absence of clear proof of negative economic effects of gerrymandering, legislators create voting districts that favor one party over another. Therefore, any effort to counter gerrymandering is a move in the right direction.”What I believe there is empirical evidence of is that entire states, such as, WV and VA have been transformed from democratic states to republican states primarily by gerrymandering. Therefore, we insist that all candidates run as independents and end party involvement in the primaries, voting districts must be redrawn according to county lines and county district lines and set in stone, ending the practice of gerrymandering. “TO ACHIEVE BETTER ECONOMIC GROWTH outcomes, radical reform of liberal democracies must not stop at overhauling the rules constraining politicians. Voters are ultimately responsible for the politicians they elect and the economic policies those politicians make. We should also reconsider voters’ proper role in a smoothly functioning liberal democracy.One needed reform, and the eighth proposal in my ten-point blueprint, is to address declining voter participation by making voting mandatory. Established democracies, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, have seen “a slow but steady decline in turnout since the 1970s.” In November 2014, only 36 percent of eligible voters in the United States cast a vote—the lowest turnout in more than seventy years. And while estimates show more than 58 percent of eligible voters voted in the 2016 US presidential election, turnout was down from 2008 (when it was 62 percent). Since 1900, the percentage of voters voting in US presidential elections has scarcely gone above 60 percent.Most often, compulsory voting is enforced through fines on those who don’t vote. If the fines are required to be minimal, along with a definition of minimal, such as the average cost of a loaf of bread, as a part of the law, I would not be against it, but when we achieve this full package, poor voter turn-out will no longer be an issue. Citizens will be eager to participate in an effective fully transparent democracy that features live streams of all elected officials when they are working for the people. Therefore, it is not included in the demands of this petition to be presented as a public mandate for governmental changes. “It is imperative to educate the population on the tradeoffs between short-term gains and their costs to future growth. Indeed, democracies should care just as much about the quality of individual voters as they do about the quantity of voter suffrage. Thus, as a ninth reform, democracies must seek to educate voters regarding the impact of policy choices. Voters must be nudged toward the right long-term policy choices (Are you suggesting the use of algorithms as an accepted policy?), rather than being swayed by personalities and short-term fixes. In its most radical form, this might extend to requiring voters to meet minimum requirements for knowledge of key public policy issues. For instance, voters might be required to pass a government-sanctioned civics test in order to vote (akin to passing a driving test to secure a driver’s license) or to pass mandatory civics courses in school before gaining the franchise. The checkered history of civil rights and suffrage means even the suggestion of such tests would be ripe for criticism and if implemented carelessly subject to abuse and discrimination. Moreover, some will object to this proposal—if even just on face value—as reviving the sorts of literary tests once used to disenfranchise racial minorities and the poor in the United States. Yet passing the sorts of civics tests described would ensure that voters made wise economic decisions or took the economic long run into account. The sort of affirmative commitment to voter education proffered by the reforms presented here promises to make a key difference in voter knowledge, their choices, and ultimately policy outcomes.The notion of restricting citizens’ voting powers may seem to fly in the face of democratic values. (may seem to fly in the face of democratic values, may seem to fly in the face of democratic values). Because people have died for the right to vote, (Because people have died for the right. Because people have died for the right to vote.), and still to this day campaign for suffrage, many will see the idea of limiting this right as beyond the pale. (Limiting this right is beyond the pale. There can be no doubt, no question, not even the slightest hint of the use of such blatantly discriminatory abuses of the God given right to vote. God granted this right to the people because of the people that died fighting for the right to vote.) Nevertheless, there is a valid debate to be had on whether taking steps to ensure a qualified electorate could enhance policymaking outcomes and thereby improve economic growth. What democracies must avoid is lengthening the tenure of elected officials without addressing voter education as well. Otherwise, the risk is that a poorly educated electorate will elect for a long term in office a poor leader or administration that implements poor policies that damage economic growth. Enhancing the quality of voters would further incentivize politicians to make better economic choices—and it would remove another excuse for politicians to focus only on the short term.” “Rather than turning away from liberal democracy, nascent democracies need to prioritize creating growth over the immediate devotion of some paradigm of democratic perfection.” Thanks for the opportunity to toss this statement back in your lap so you can pick it up and take a good look at it from a different point of view. Rather than turning away from globalization, developed democracies need to prioritize creating growth over the immediate devotion of some paradigm of globalist perfection. My point here is, which is more important in the long term, short term or on any terms and there can be only one answer. “In December 2010, a poor Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi lit himself on fire to protest the arbitrary expropriation of his goods and his economic future. Within weeks Bouazizi’s act of self-immolation precipitated the Arab Spring revolutions, as under the slogan of “Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam” (“People demand removal of the regime”) protests spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunisia to Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Sudan, and Yemen. Today, that region is in the midst of what some are likening to a modern Thirty Years War.” Limiting this right is beyond the pale. Nevertheless, this ignites a blazing hot funeral pyre under the valid debate on striking the proper balance between protectionism and globalism.                         One human, one vote.“It is imperative to educate the population…” I agree whole heartedly with this portion of the above quoted paragraph, the rest of the paragraph, not so much. As did the Founding Fathers, which is why we had, arguably, the greatest public education system in the world until the early sixties. There is a singular reason why that began to change when the federal government began desegregating public schools and the reason is that the federal government also began to micro-manage public schools in ways that had nothing to do with desegregation. It is imperative that control of public schools be turned over to county school boards. One human, one vote. “In short, democracies should aim both to expand the electorate (as per the eighth reform) and to improve the quality of voter decisions (as per the ninth reform). But a tenth and final reform—weighted voting—would allow them to pursue both in unison. While the ninth reform requires that voters meet a minimum set of standards, the tenth reform has a different objective: enhancing the voting status of highly qualified individuals. Implementing both these reforms (the ninth and tenth) effectively delineates among three tiers of voters: the unqualified, the standard qualified voter, and the highly qualified voter. Some form of weighted voting would boost the influence of the best-informed segment of the electorate, even as that group expanded over time. It thus offers a route to achieving a fully informed and participating electorate. As a practical matter, each society would decide whether voters would be required to sit additional tests to achieve enhanced voter status (as proposed in the tenth reform) or whether a voter would automatically obtain enhanced voter accreditation based on their professional standing or qualifications. This is an example of a reform that would likely require some form of constitutional amendment.” Good, because, nobody wants it not even you, I believe you favor one aspect of “The Art of the Deal” and excel at lighting a fire under the debate you wish to foment. Am I wrong?“…Despite its track record of being deployed for reasons of prejudice…”One human, one vote. “…The system of universal and automatic suffrage that prevails in leading democracies today carries with it the perennial risk that voter apathy and ignorance will allow politicians to sway the electorate with attractive short-term promises they do not follow through on once they are in office. One famous example in the United States is then–presidential candidate George H. W. Bush’s famous 1988 pledge, “Read my lips: no new taxes,” a promise that likely helped him win the election. Although President Bush opposed the introduction of new taxes when he became president, he eventually agreed to a 1990 budget that saw an increase in several existing taxes. Many voters interpreted this as his going back on his word, and it possibly cost him the next election. A weighted voting system offers a real chance to address this danger by preventing citizens from voting for the wrong reasons and diminishing the influence of the voters most likely to do so. It also reduces the influence of those most likely to be apathetic or disengaged from public policy debates and thus most likely to make poor electoral choices, notwithstanding the fact that the citizen always retains the option to become more knowledgeable and qualified.” What kind of example is that? There might be many other, better reasons why “old” George wasn’t re-elected, one might be the fact that he attempted dictate to the public; “You will specialize!” Many other reasons were brought home by soldiers involved in “Desert Storm” 8/2/1990 to 1/16/1991, that informed the public that precision bombing was not the only kind of bombing being used in Iraq and that entire towns were wiped out for no apparent reason. It would be wise, in deed, for voters to hold a president who was an ex-director of the CIA directly responsible for such veiled atrocities when the media had nothing but praise and excellent footage of precision bombing, it was incredibly impressive. Young George must have decided it was best to hide as much of the truth as possible when he started another war in Iraq and then invaded Afghanistan only to label the leaders we had backed as freedom fighters in the Reagan years a terrorist organization. “Truth has power. And if we all gravitate toward similar ideas, maybe we do so because those ideas are true ... written deep within us. And when we hear the truth, even if we don't understand it, we feel that truth resonate within us ... vibrating with our unconscious wisdom. Perhaps the truth is not learned by us, but rather, the truth is re-called ... re-membered ... re-cognized ... as that which is already inside us.” DAN BROWN, The Lost Symbol.Perhaps the truth is revealed, through revelations in the subconscious!“Peace on this planet will not be forged by military strength. It will be forged by those who come together despite their government's differences.” DAN BROWN, Deception Point.Teachings of a nun at St. Andrews Catholic School 50-years ago:All people on the earth today, have a common enemy. Our common enemy is only represented by the leadership of China, the Chinese Communist Party is ours and the rest of the world’s common enemy, but they are not actually to blame, for the true enemy resides in history. The people who set China on the path to total world control by programming their children from birth to program Europeans, Eurasians, Africans and virtually all nationalities to do their bidding by covertly infiltrating other governing bodies of the world to control dictators and destroy their two main enemies from within, democracy and religion, have long since died around three thousand years ago. Leaving todays Chinese  leadership slaves to the past, therefore, all people on the earth, including Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin have one enemy in common with the rest of the world, MIND CONTROL or HUMAN PROGRAMMING. Beginning sometime during the ancient China era, circa 1600-221 BC, even before Mandarin Chinese had been named during the Ming Dynasty, circa 1400, China had set its sights on total world control by usurping the power of Kings through mind control, programming the Kings of other countries. Though the imperial era ended in 1912 when the Peoples Republic began, the leadership of China did not change. The true leadership always held secrecy in high regard, and it served them well when they saw that change was coming well before 1700. The Chinese saw the writing on the wall and decided to send out their Japanese intelligence gatherers to all parts of the earth in circa 1700 on a 200-year mission to gather knowledge of where the next great revolution would come from, so they could get ahead of it. This resulted in the ultimate divide and conquer plan using the writings of Karl Marx that gave way to World War I and II. This is why communism looks nothing like the writings of Karl Marx and never will. Communism is a psychological program that says all property is publicly held for the good of the people but that is a big lie. Every example we have of Communism, what is called public property is actually owned by the communist party and the people are the exploited property of the communist party.  A Catholic Nun taught us that Nazi-ism and Communism is the ultimate attempt to divide and conquer because the goal is to make the public believe these are the only two choices they have, while the result is the same regardless of which one you choose because they are two sides of the same coin. She said that the proof that they are two sides of the same coin is that Hitler and Stalin had the same program. She taught us that, universal slavery was the outcome of either choice, the programming of every human being on the earth with the leaders being the most thoroughly programmed of all. She said that they have always claimed that they already have total control, but she assured us that while we still have the United States Constitution, we can still break free. She taught us that the ""TOTAL CONTROL PROGRAMS"" most perplexing aspect is that there is no-one now living that is to blame for this because according to her synopsis of world history, it all began in China about 3,000 years ago. (This was 5th or 6th grade and my memory is that she said over 10,000 years ago, but my initial research suggested this was unlikely so I’m trying to do some more research to help me get a grip on what she likely did teach us. Anyone who attended St. Andrews elementary in Roanoke VA in the sixties or seventies that still have your notebooks from this class, please make several hard copies and share them with trusted friends and relatives before scanning them and sharing them with me at rcasey95@frontier.com. Added 2/21/2019, China’s penchant for changing the historic record may be the reason 10,000 years does not pan out.) She said that China’s education system had been more about programming than educating. This was a natural result of the difficulty of learning the written Chinese languages such as mandarin Chinese. But they realized the power of programming and they sought to control the world by gaining control of a country by programming the countries King and ruling class. In fact, it would not be until the gestation period that gave birth to the US Constitution that a clear distinction was made between programming and educating. Our Founding Fathers realized that there is a difference and that a person that is programmed is not free. This is why they made such a strong commitment to education and tried to put the “Finishing” schools and ETON behind them.China was the first country to program Arabs to gather information in the Mideast and to program Europeans to gather information in Europe. When China began trying to rule the world by getting control of the Kings and the ruling classes by programming them Japan was the first and perhaps the UK was the second. If you said, “The sun never sets on the Japanese Empire” or “The sun never sets on the British Empire”, you were in effect saying the sun never sets on the Chinese Empire. As time went by, they expanded the number of people being programmed from the ruling class of the UK to the Gentry. The conflict that this programming causes in the mind of every individual creates the need for more programming that resulted in ""Control Freaks"", evil, demented, wicked Kings. This resulted in public resistance that began to overthrow the wicked rulers. Democracy, China’s old enemy, they knew could be controlled through secrecy and corruption, both of which were facilitated by centralizing the democracy. The problem for China in the 18th century was that there was so much going on. This is part of the reason the United States of America was able to set up such a strong democratic republic. Another reason is that George Washington and others among the Founding Fathers knew the pitfalls of excessive secrecy and excessive foreign entanglements. They understood to some degree China’s deep influence over Great Britain but not all of it. China had many of the gentry and ruling class fully programmed and great influence over many others. Clearly, a part of the way China controlled countries that George Washington did not understand was how Alexander Hamilton got away with setting up the financial system, “1st, as a puzzle to exclude popular understanding & inquiry. 2nd, as a machine for the corruption of the legislature;” as described by Thomas Jefferson. But they were not able to prevent our constitution from giving great respect to state’s rights, though they were able to prevent decentralizing from going even further which was aimed at insuring that counties would be the smallest governing entity and that they would have sovereignty over the people of the county, which meant if the people paid income tax it would go to the county. This was being led by Thomas Jefferson who accepted the appointment to be ambassador to France, which was successful in keeping him out of the way until these things had been settled.This is where we are today with circles within circles of the programmed and the programmers. The CIA believes they developed something knew in the MK-Ultra program and that they perfected it, but they were only Chinese dupes, programmed by Americans but China is ultimately behind all programming in the world. The CIA are novices, while the Chinese are the masters of programming. By influencing countries to employ secrecy in government China forces foreign countries to play its game and stacks the deck heavily in its own favor. Sister taught us that there is a saving grace that we must seek to strengthen if we are ever able to release the human race from the grips of history. This saving grace is that all humans experience a powerful internal conflict as they struggle to regain their freewill until the day they die. The most frightening new aspect of this is that computers are being used to program people and therefore, become a part of the circles within circles. Computers do not have any internal conflict therefore they do not have any saving grace, none. This saving grace conflict that humans experience is dealt with by programming - denial of being programmed and programming that – I am the programmer not the programmed. And so, it goes, the circles within circles for centuries in which no-one living is to blame for the programming because the leaders are being programmed by programmers that have been programmed by others that have long been dead. Circles within circles.Which brings us to an epiphany that I experienced while listening to Father Sebastian Dezasya, who is from India, speak for Frances Jeanette Casey’s funeral, my mother, who died January 15, 2018 at the age of 93. He spoke about the incorruptible people that would walk upon the earth when the holy scriptures are fulfilled. I was deeply impressed with this man’s sincerity and began to wonder about an incorruptible people and the ""third eye"" of Hinduism and the perplexing gauntlet thrown down before me 50 years ago and perhaps, Dan Brown’s “Lost Symbol” played into it. The third eye is believed to be used to see beyond the apparent to protect good people from evil, as the eye of spiritual wisdom opens, all the evil will vanish. For some odd reason, listening to this Catholic Priest from India made me realize that with our current technology there might finally be a way to strengthen our saving grace and to extract ourselves from the circles within circles. By getting tech companies to develop an audio and video micro-transmitter that would adhere to the forehead hidden by hair, or embedded on the rim of glasses invisible to the naked eye that transmits to your smartphone with some minor enhancement to recognize when someone is being excessively repetitious and ring your phone so you can excuse yourself and review the audio and video to become aware of your own circle and figure out the answers to these important questions; ""Who is programming you?"" and ""What are they programming you to do?"", so you can put a stop to it. Audio and video recorders that are enhanced to go even further to view and listen to your computer to detect any subliminal images or sounds attempting to program you, sell you a product or vote a certain way. This is what the tech programs produced by Halliburton to teach about the use of industrial electronic controls, certainly does. These instructional programs subliminally try to make men gay by displaying images of carnal sex between two men not visible to the naked eye. This is what frightens me about this quote “Voters must be nudged toward the right long-term policy choices,” from the text in Ms. Dambisa Moyo’s book. ""We the People"" must get ahead of these problems.  We didn't start the fireIt was always burningSince the world's been turningWe didn't start the fireNo we didn't light itBut we tried to fight it There’s something going on around hereJust what it is ain’t exactly clear There’s a man with a gun over thereWell, I don't know why I came here tonightI get the feeling that something ain't rightTrying to make some sense of it allBut I can see it makes no sense at allLet us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting lateTwo riders were approaching, the wind began to howlThere’s a change in the wind, you know the signs don’t lieSuch a strange feeling and I don’t know why, it’s taking such a long timeBut I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lordWell I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, hold on.But I know the reason why you keep this silence upThe hurt doesn't show, but the pain still growsIt's no stranger to you and meHold on, hold on.

By thoroughly investigating this case connections between FBI or CIA or both will likely be found with the alleged murderer, Cristhian Bahena Rivera as well as the victim, Mollie Tibbets. If Mr. Rivera were provided with recording equipment and encouraged to spend a couple of hours each day trying to remember everything that he can about the six months leading up to the murder of Mollie Tibbets including the names of as many people as he can recall coming in contact with during this period these connections might be revealed. The problem with programming is that anyone can be programmed to do anything. Mr. Rivera may well have committed the crime, but if he was programmed by the FBI or CIA to commit the crime, who is really responsible for this young woman’s death? It might also be found that getting this young man to actually commit the crime was proving difficult, so the handlers opted for temporary memory loss, during which time agents murdered the young woman, put her body in the trunk of his car and used the ear buds to prompt him to look in his trunk. They may have simply relied on his panic and confusion and allowed the events to play out from there. This explains the memory loss, he certainly made no effort to hide that was involved.Man charged with killing Mollie Tibbetts is an undocumented immigrant, authorities say By Eli Rosenberg, Nick Mirof and Cleve R. Wootson, Jr. 8/21/2018 WP Law enforcement officials in Iowa charged a man on Tuesday with murdering 20-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts, saying he admitted to pursuing her as she ran on a country road and eventually led them to the field where a body, they believe to be hers was hidden under cornstalks. The suspect was identified as 24-year-old Cristhian Bahena Rivera, who authorities said was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Rivera worked at a local farm for the past four years, according to the Associated Press. Authorities also spelled Rivera’s first name as Christian. He was charged with first-degree murder, with a potential penalty of life in prison, according to Rick Rahn, a special agent in charge for the sector at the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.Tibbetts, who was studying psychology at the University of Iowa, had been missing since leaving for a run last month from her boyfriend’s house in Brooklyn, Iowa, a small town of about 1,500. The case unraveled in dramatic fashion on Tuesday as reports emerged in the morning that authorities had found Tibbetts’s body, followed by an afternoon announcement that Rivera had been arrested and charged. Rahn declined to give many details about Tibbetts’s killing, citing the ongoing investigation and saying that her body had yet to be formally identified. He said that Rivera told investigators that he saw her running, approached her, and ran alongside or behind her, even relaying to authorities that Tibbetts had grabbed her phone and threatened to call the police. He continued to pursue her and then abducted her, Rahn said.For more than a month after Tibbetts disappeared on July 18, federal, state and local authorities scoured the rural county, sifting through electronic data from her Fitbit, cellphone and social media accounts for any clue about what happened to her. Rahn said that investigators had talked to hundreds of people and received more than 4,000 tips, but the break in the case came within the last two weeks when they found someone with a security camera system while canvassing a neighborhood. The cameras captured images of Tibbetts running, as well as a black Chevy Malibu that investigators said they traced to Rivera, informing a determination that Rivera was one of the last people to see her running, Rahn said. They conducted a lengthy interview with Rivera on Monday after approaching him for the first time, in which he told them about seeing her running and how he pursued her. “He was very compliant,” Rahn said. “He was willing to talk to us. There was no fight or struggle of any kind.”But the account Rivera gave investigators has some significant gaps in it, according to an affidavit filed in district court. Rivera told them that he panicked after Tibbetts said she was going to call the police and “blocked” his “memory,” the affidavit said. His memory picks up again at an intersection where he noticed a headphone earpiece in his lap and realized he had put Tibbetts in his trunk, where he found her with blood on her head, it said. He then dragged her into a secluded place in a cornfield, where he left her face up and covered her with corn stalks. Rahn said Rivera led officials to her body after they were done interviewing him. He also said that officials believed that Rivera was employed but declined to specify how or with whom.The results of an autopsy are pending, and Rahn did not specify a cause of death. Rivera is being held at the Poweshiek County jail in lieu of a $1 million cash bond. A representative for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency lodged an immigration detainer on Rivera with local authorities after his arrest on Tuesday. Rivera worked at Yarrabee Farms in Brooklyn, Iowa, the farm’s president Eric Lang told the AP. He was in good standing, according to Lang, and had passed the government’s E-Verify system. Lang is the brother of Craig Lang, a “prominent Iowa farmer and GOP official” who recently lost the 2018 Republican primary to become Iowa’s agriculture secretary.The case seems certain to add fuel to the already explosive and racially tinged debate about immigration, as President Trump’s border wall, which he touts as a symbol of security, remains an unfulfilled and unfunded campaign promise. At a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night, Trump referred to the killing and the arrest of the “illegal alien” from Mexico. “You saw what happened to that beautiful, incredible young woman. Should have never happened. Illegally in our country,” he said. “The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We’re getting them changed.”“Heartbroken by the news about Mollie Tibbetts,” Vice President Pence wrote on Twitter. “We commend the swift action by local, state, & federal investigators working in Iowa in apprehending an illegal immigrant, who’s now charged with first-degree murder.”The broad contours of Tibbetts’s death are reminiscent of the case of Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old white woman whose 2015 death, after she was struck by a bullet in a popular area of San Francisco, has become a cri de coeur for Trump and other conservatives and proponents of harsher immigration laws. An undocumented immigrant, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was later convicted on a gun charge related to Steinle’s death. Zarate had already been deported from the United States five times.Tibbetts was born in San Francisco and moved to the Iowa town with her mother when she was in second grade. She won state speech competitions, was involved in theater and ran cross-country. Christopher Ingraham and Philip Bump contributed to this report. It is not as if we don’t already have cases in which the FBI were closely involved, even following closely behind and using text messages to prompt the committing of the first ISIS attack on US soil, “The Attack at Garland” 60 minutes. ‘On this week's broadcast of CBS News' 60 Minutes, correspondent Anderson Cooper reports an undercover FBI agent tracking jihadists responsible for the Garland, Texas terrorist attack was on the scene prior to the commission of the act. ”It’s mostly been forgotten because the two terrorists were killed by local cops before they managed to murder anyone.”’ “Were Garland, Texas jihadis aided by FBI?” REBEL“In looking into what happened in Garland, we were surprised to discover just how close the FBI was to one of the terrorists. Not only had the FBI been monitoring him for years, there was an undercover agent right behind him when the first shots were fired.” “After the trial we found out that they(FBI) had had an undercover agent who had been texting with Simpson, less than three weeks before the attack, [writing] to him ‘Tear up Texas,'” attorney Dan Maynard said. Simpson responded, “bro, you don’t have to say that…” The terrorist added, “you know what happened in Paris… so that goes without saying. No need to be direct.” The FBI argued that the “Tear up Texas” message was not incitement. An affidavit filed in another case said that the agent also “traveled to Garland, Texas, and was present… at the event. ”Maynard was given documents that showed the FBI agent was in a car directly behind Simpson and Soofi when they started shooting, and that he had taken a cell-phone photo of the security guard and police officer who engaged in a firefight with the terrorists. “The idea that he’s right there 30 seconds before the attack happens is just incredible to me,” Maynard said.“There was no advance knowledge of a plot to attack the cartoon drawing contest in Garland, Texas,” the FBI said in a statement to CBS after declining an interview request.“Stephen Paddock’s father, Benjamin Paddock, was on the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted list in the 1970s for robbing banks and was described as psychopathic in an arrest warrant.” “We live in terrible times. I believe that everyman must risk something so that in the end he does not have to risk everything. The terrorist situation is literally that – terrifying. We must put an end to it. … If you believe in what you are doing. Do not let anyone frighten you away.” Quote of character Dr. Louis Desforges who was clearly intended to be the hero of the novel “Windmills of the Gods” by Sidney Sheldon. “We the People” must stand together in peaceful resolution and demand that all elected federal, state and county officials be granted immunity for past activities except Mike Pence, to assure the public all elected officials are free of the influence of compromising information held by any part of the intelligence (intimidation) community. All elected public officials will agree to wearing three body-cams with enhanced audio and video, which are on the frame of glasses or along the hairline, 24/7 with miniature audio receivers worn on the earlobes to catch those who would whisper in their ear while they are sleeping. This is to assure the public that our elected officials are the people that are making the decisions and are not being unduly influenced or programmed by anyone else, including their spouse, especially their spouse. President Donald Trump is not getting the cabinet he wants by the dismissals taking place, Mike Pence is. The problem is not Trump, Vice President Mike Pence is the problem. Pence is the one responsible for recommending the most troublesome cabinet members and it’s the few picks Trump made that are being forced out. Pence is the one that should be impeached but the best we can probably hope for is to force him to resign by overwhelming public opinion. And we must force out his Alt-Right cabinet picks, Pruitt, Carson, Sessions and the rest must go with him. Well, what do you know, Pruitt and Sessions are already gone. When it is suggested that Pence’s’ evangelical status, brings respectability to the Trump White House, it is to ignore the historic record. According to a book written by those assigned the task of investigating the American Nazi Party before and during WWII, most American Nazi Party leaders went underground as evangelists to continue programming followers without government oversight and enjoying tax-free status. Three names I recall are Norman Vincent Peale, Billy Graham and Ed Koch. Using this information, I have tried to Google this book without any luck, but I guarantee there are hundreds of copies still out there. If you have one, make a couple hundred copies and spread them around before revealing the fact that you have one. It has been reported that Pence was groomed to remain free of controversy to gain a high political office by his evangelistic mentor. If Trump is allowed to think on his own, I believe he will be more likely to choose more moderate cabinet members based on a consensus of those with expertise in the field.             What amazes me about these two new books is how Dambisa Moyo’s “Edge of Chaos” directly takes on the national debt and economics angle of this document and Jason Chaffetz “The Deep State” directly takes on the national debt and secret agency angle that I have been working on for two years. Let’s not talk about all the rabbit holes I went down after my first year owning my computer, not that I feel any different about all that stuff, but it was just too much. So, I’m trying to refocus on that original paper with the addition of the teachings of the Catholic Nun and the incredible content of these two new books. But what just blows my mind is how “Edge of Chaos” provides irrefutable empirical research that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that China has been able to stack the globalism deck so heavily in her own favor that we must conclude that she knows what cards everyone else is holding, not only that, but Xi is able to influence how they play their cards. Perhaps this is why old methods for solving economic problems are no longer effective. I started at the end of Ms. Dambisa Moyo’s fabulously named, fabulous new book, Edge of Chaos. Back to the beginning to pick out all of the ways her economic research supports the irrefutable fact that China has undue influence in the world economy and therefore, undue influence in foreign governments.INTRODUCTION“ALMOST THREE DECADES AGO, THE Berlin Wall fell. A period of barely restrained chaos, turmoil, and stagnation across the Soviet bloc had come to an end, and new market capitalist democracies began to emerge not only in the former Soviet sphere but also throughout the developing world, promising economic prosperity and peace for their citizens. Analysts and economists believed the end of communism portended a new era of stability and growth. Yet less than thirty years later, all signs point toward a world once again on the edge of chaos.”Communism will not end until the ruling class in China begins wearing the body cam and audio equipment that will allow them to become aware of their servitude to history and to free themselves from thousands of years of mind control through programming circles that arose quite innocently thousands of years ago as a product of the learning process associated with the complexity of the pre-Mandarin Chinese language. When the Berlin Wall fell it was the end of the Soviet Union but not the end of communism, not in Russia and certainly not in China. The programming and mind control may have begun, quite innocently but the plan to control other country’s by gaining control of their kings was well thought out and highly effective for centuries. There were problems with keeping it from becoming widely known that China was gaining control of countries by programming their rulers which resulted in wars and solved by genocide. The real problems arose from the psychopathic effects the programming had on the rulers. Romans did not go mad from lead in their water supply, they were driven mad by excessive attempts at mind control, much as we are seeing history repeating itself in the halls of Congress and in campaign ads. Altering history is an important aspect of why China has been able to get away with doing this for centuries, while their methods have been discovered numerous times throughout history, they have been able to wipe out those that were onto them and rewrite history to cover their tracks, always using others, such as the Catholic Church to do their dirty work or rewriting history framing their arch enemy that was exposing their tactics.Wikipedia: “Putin was born in Leningrad in the Soviet Union. He studied law at Leningrad State University, graduating in 1975. Putin was a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before resigning in 1991 to enter politics in Saint Petersburg. He moved to Moscow in 1996 and joined President Boris Yeltsin's administration, rising quickly through the ranks and becoming Acting President on 31 December 1999, when Yeltsin resigned. Putin won the 2000 presidential election by a 53% to 30% margin, thus avoiding a runoff with his Communist Party of the Russian Federation opponent, Gennady Zyuganov. He was reelected president in 2004 with 72% of the vote. During his first presidency, the Russian economy grew for eight straight years, and GDP measured in purchasing power increased by 72%. The growth was a result of the 2000s commodities boom, recovery from the post-Communist depression and financial crises, and prudent economic and fiscal policies. Because of constitutionally mandated term limits, Putin was ineligible to run for a third consecutive presidential term in 2008. The 2008 presidential election was won by Dmitry Medvedev, who appointed Putin as Prime Minister, the beginning of what some opponents considered to be a period of ""tandemocracy"".In September 2011, after presidential terms were extended from four to six years, Putin announced he would seek a third term as president. He won the March 2012 presidential election with 64% of the vote, a result which aligned with pre-election polling. Falling oil prices coupled with international sanctions imposed at the beginning of 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Eastern Ukraine led to GDP shrinking by 3.7% in 2015, though the Russian economy rebounded in 2016 with 0.3% GDP growth and is officially out of the recession. Putin gained 76% of the March 2018 presidential vote and was re-elected for a six-year term that will end in 2024. Under Putin's leadership, Russia has scored poorly in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index and experienced democratic backsliding according to both the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and Freedom House's Freedom in the World index (including a record low 20/100 rating in the 2017 Freedom in the World report, a rating not given since the time of the Soviet Union). Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing the lack of free and fair elections, purges and jailing of opponents, and curtailed press freedom. Human rights organizations and activists have accused Putin of persecuting political critics and activists, as well as ordering them tortured or assassinated; he has rejected accusations of human rights abuses. Officials of the United States government have accused him of leading an interference program against Hillary Clinton in support of Donald Trump during the U.S. presidential election in 2016, an allegation which both Trump and Putin have frequently denied and criticized.”  “Edge of Chaos argues that liberal democracies of the sort prevalent in the West simply cannot deliver this growth without substantial reform. Without fundamental changes, democratic politicians will struggle to address the numerous headwinds the global economy faces today. Indeed, the myopia within democracy leads to the misallocation of scarce resources, such as capital and labor, and shortsighted investment decisions by politicians and business. Ultimately, the myriad economic challenges are a manifestation of a corrosive problem in the democratic political process…”“…Stagnant growth, entrenched poverty, high unemployment, unwinding globalization, and geopolitical unrest have become the new normal. The skepticism among policymakers, politicians, and ordinary people about the capacity of democratic capitalism to deliver growth and reduce poverty over the long term is in fact very rational. The state capitalism of China, Lee Kuan Yew’s Singapore, and Chile under General Augusto Pinochet have all moved hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and in some cases delivered impressive advances. The formidable economic performance over recent decades of such nations and others that are not liberal democracies—64 percent of the world’s elected governments in all—seems to suggest that democracy is not a prerequisite of economic growth.Yet Edge of Chaos insists on the promise of liberal democracy. After all, per capita incomes in liberal democracies continue to rise, albeit sluggishly. Meanwhile, the problems of growth are not confined to market capitalism—and real problems such as corruption infect state capitalist and other competing systems. Rather than turning away from liberal democracy, nascent democracies need to prioritize creating growth over the immediate devotion of some paradigm of democratic perfection. And established democracies must put their own houses in order by passing aggressive constitutional reforms.” Yes, we must put our own house in order, but constitutional reforms are not the answer or the only way to achieve these goals.“Above all, policymakers must face up to the facts of the twenty-first century. In an interconnected world of anemic growth, other countries’ crises will become our crises, whether they take the form of terrorism, income inequality, refugees, the resurgence of infectious diseases, or illegal immigration, and governments will grow ever more fragmented, and weak, further undermining an already fragile international community. For Americans, and policymakers in the world at large, protectionism and isolationism are no remedy. Historical evidence makes clear that protectionism will be accompanied by higher unemployment, lower economic performance, and stagnating living standards in the United States and elsewhere. An economically weakened and isolationist America will call into question the Pax Americana, whereby the United States oversees international peace and security, and thus expose the world to the unpredictable whims and values of nondemocratic powers. These are not the solutions the world needs.Creating sustainable economic growth in the twenty-first century requires no less than aggressively retooling history’s greatest engine of growth, democratic capitalism itself. This requires a clear-eyed assessment of how ineffective the system is in its current state, politically as well as economically—and then implementing the repairs that will yield better outcomes. Too much is at stake for us to remain wedded to the status quo. The ominous rise of protectionism and nationalism throughout the world portend that the global economy and community are eroding already. The only way forward is to preserve the best of liberal democratic capitalism and to repair the worst. We cannot cling to past practices and old ideologies simply for their own sake…” Chapter 1: The Imperative is Growth “GROWTH MATTERS—POWERFULLY—TO ORDINARY people. When economic growth wanes, everyone suffers. Stagnation exacerbates numerous social, health, environmental, and political problems. The very essence of culture, community, and people’s individual expectations about the kinds of lives they can lead become dimmer, coarser, and smaller in the absence of growth…”“… Growth enhances the living standards of both individuals and society as a whole in three main ways. First and most straightforwardly, growth offers the individual an opportunity to improve their own livelihood.” … “Second, growth in income can allow an individual to have an impact on the wider community.” … “There is a third, more complex way that growth can enhance (or by its absence diminish) the quality of life: through its role in preserving transparent political structures. (No amount of growth will make Chinese communism more transparent, exactly the opposite, the increasing strength of the central government makes it more difficult for the people to foment change toward any level of transparency. In China no level of accountability exists between the people and the communist party. The communist party of China can only be held accountable from outside pressure.) Personal rights and freedoms can only exist if a society is able to hold government accountable. Growth allows society to sustain itself and to ensure accountability, but in the absence of growth, society weakens. In this way, economic stress creates the conditions for political upheaval and, at the extreme, the breakdown of liberal democratic institutions…”“…Quite clearly economic growth is utterly vital to the survival, success, and stability of a nation. The challenge of economics since its inception has been to pinpoint the key elements of growth and to navigate the maze of individuals and businesses to determine how these contribute to real, sustained growth.” “…Evaluating the true health of an economy is complex. The presence of debt can complicate the picture.” “…debt can have deleterious effects on economic growth…” Chapter 2: A Brief History of Growth “…CHINA HAD GONE FROM BEING the richest economy in the world in the nineteenth century to one of the poorest by 1950, only to reemerge over the last four decades as an economic powerhouse while shifting the balance of global power toward the East.” “…Yet the subsequent decades witnessed a dramatic shift in the balance of world economic power. By 1890 the West had taken over. The industrial revolution pushed Europe to the lead, with a 40 percent share of world GDP. Meanwhile, China experienced a rapid decline, while America was ascending; the two countries briefly held the same share of 13 percent.By 1950, the transition seemed to be all but over. The United States and Europe were booming, together representing a massive 60 percent of world GDP—America alone at close to 30 percent. After falling to 5.2 percent, China would spend the following twenty-five years treading water around the same share of approximately 5 percent of world GDP…”“…China has emerged to dominate the economic landscape over the last four decades, becoming deeply involved in trade, foreign direct investment, and capital markets across the globe. According to the International Monetary Fund, China contributed about one-third of the world’s total growth in 2013, and even with slower growth it will continue to add at least 1 percentage point to world growth in the coming years. Trade, exports, and more recently an explicit policy pledge to move to a consumption-led economy are at the heart of China’s success. Chinese overseas investment is expected to reach over US$3 trillion worldwide by 2025.Much has changed since the 1800s, when China was the world’s largest economy. The intervening years saw the economy crater through to the middle of the 1900s, then rise to a position of relative strength today. China’s economic success was interrupted by a spate of natural disasters and plagues, political fragmentation, and rebellion, which together weakened its ability to enact policies that promoted growth and development. The country was effectively sidelined while other regions such as the United States and Europe were making rapid progress. For example, the Taiping Rebellion, which lasted fourteen years, from 1850 to 1864, was enormously disruptive, destroying over six hundred cities and leaving over twenty million people dead. It did so much damage that the government of the Chinese Qing Dynasty had to rely on aid from Britain and France to defeat it. More recently, China masterfully executed a carefully choreographed plan for achieving long-term growth. Many aspects of how the Chinese political class manages its economy are antithetical to the Western values of democracy and free markets. But this stance has not put off foreign investors, who are attracted to the government’s willingness to prioritize physical infrastructure, political security, and stability over the health of the population, transparency in decision making, and transparency in the rule of law (if not necessarily the system of governance). In essence, the pursuit of economic growth overrides any views on the political system they invest in.Currently China’s political class has a strategy to evolve from an investment-led exporting economy to one more in line with Western economies, relying on domestic consumption. The transition to this new economic equilibrium will not be linear. China will likely experience significant economic volatility and market gyrations as the structure of its economy shifts. There is also mounting skepticism about China’s ability to manage its debt levels, and the country’s lack of individual political freedoms will continue to hamper its growth prospects. But Chinese policymakers will, no doubt, be focused on continuing to show economic progress in advance of two target dates: 2021—one hundred years after the formation of the Communist Party—and 2049, one hundred years after the formation of the People’s Republic of China…”Democratic countries “…increases in economic growth” “…was driven by a constant and growing recognition that liberalization of the political and economic systems would best catalyze economic growth. This combination of political and economic liberalism in Europe and the United States would serve as the foundation for their emergence as the undisputed economic champions of the world between the industrial revolution and the post–World War II period.Yet in the wake of the 2008 crisis, and for the first time in living memory,the West’s growth path is in doubt.As we shall see in the next chapter, the key drivers of economic success over the last several decades—such as demographic shifts and productivity gains linked to technological advancements that improved efficiency—are now becoming barriers to further economic growth. Policymakers struggle to create sustained economic growth in developed countries that, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, continue to suffer under the weight of high debts and deficits, eroding quantity and quality of labor, and declining productivity.What lessons can we glean from this brief history of growth? A common thread running through the stories of Japan, China, Argentina, the United States, and Europe is the importance of strong and trustworthy institutions. Over an expansive body of scholarship, historians, political scientists, and economists have concluded there is a correlation between a country’s economic growth and the strength of its institutions. Without a civil service, police, and judiciary that can be relied on, poor economic outcomes will almost certainly ensue. As David Landes has argued, strong political institutions that protect the rule of law, individual freedom, and private property underpin development and economic growth. In keeping with this analysis, China’s contemporary economic success is largely attributable to its political system, which has been capable of defending and enforcing property rights. China’s law explicitly allows owners to reap economic benefits from property ownership, including the right to make a profit. Furthermore, the owner has the right to possess, utilize, and obtain profits from the real properties owned by others. China’s example shows that what is important for investment and, ultimately, economic growth is policy predictability and institutions that preserve and defend property rights—not necessarily democratic institutions per se.China’s political institutions may not be completely transparent or even democratic, but they are unquestionably strong. China’s governing Communist Party controls the National People’s Congress and State Council, which as the legislature and executive, respectively, have formed the institutional bedrock of China’s economic success. Through these structures, the political leadership is able to roll out the country’s public policy agenda across an extensive network of local government.Institutional strength is not simply about the ability to deliver sound policy in peacetime and normal economic conditions. It is also about the adaptability of these institutions and their capacity to stand firm even under the pressure of exogenous economic volatility and political upheaval. Poorly fashioned bureaucracies and inherited institutions that fail to keep up with current population makeup and a modern economic and political construct leave themselves vulnerable. History is littered with examples of this path to political downfall—from the French Revolution to the end of the Soviet bloc to the 2016 populist discord threatening the existence and future of the European Union, catalyzed by the referendum vote by Britain to exit the community…” Best thing that can happen to the rest of the European Union is for Britain to make a quick and clean break. IN ADDITION TO NATURAL RESOURCES and strong political institutions, other factors that shape growth include colonialism, war, and cultural norms. Colonial powers partitioned continents to establish national boundaries that forced traditionally rival ethnic groups to live together; colonialist bureaucracies were also incompatible with the lives of indigenous populations. Nation building proved virtually impossible, as tribal and ethnic clashes continually undermined economic success and sometimes led to outright war.” What we have done in the Middle East and Africa under the guidance of the Intelligence Community is to create vacuums for China and Russia, exactly what our politicians say we are trying to avoid. The reason is simple, secret agencies are the means to an end, a democracy is a more complex apparatus to control than a monarchy. As long as we allow the Intelligence Community to run our country by the threat of exposing the compromising, information they possess on the members of Congress they will continue to do China’s bidding. The writings of our Founding Fathers in the Anti-federalist papers regarding county government had far greater popular support than the Federalist papers. Today, these changes make the federal government stronger in the world by reducing its responsibilities in providing for the needs of the people. Republicans and Democrats are more interested in wielding power over the states and cities regardless of Republicans rhetoric about state’s rights they both keep expanding the federal government and therefore the national debt destroying us from within. China has clearly learned by the writings of our Founding Fathers and they are using that knowledge to pull the plug on democratic capitalism in the world. “Through these structures, the political leadership is able to roll out the country’s public policy agenda across an extensive network of local government.” In a bathtub full of democratic capitalism, the US is the plug that keeps all other forms of democracy from flushing swiftly down the drain. Russia is the drain and China is that unseen pipe further down the line that breaths air into the communist system, the vent pipe. The plumber is on a roll, so ride with me, secrecy is the P-trap that keeps the hideous odor of the sewer system (the communist, Nazi, fascist systems and all of the death they cause) from hitting you right in the mouth. What we need to be doing in Afghanistan and Iraq is secure their borders, keeping Iran out, and building strong democratic local governments, and learning from “Colonial powers partitioned continents to establish national boundaries that forced traditionally rival ethnic groups to live together; colonialist bureaucracies were also incompatible with the lives of indigenous populations. Nation building proved virtually impossible, as tribal and ethnic clashes continually undermined economic success and sometimes led to outright war.” If we learn from history Nation building can be an enormous success creating highly committed, highly motivated allies. To achieve this, we must only be involved on the county level, helping the people of Iraq and Afghanistan elect county commissions. Then we should step back and advise them to form separate states along ethnic lines, allowing these people to have the independence to form a state constitution while electing representatives to send to the capital to produce the kind of national constitution that respects state and local government. All people, Chinese, Russian, Arab, African want democracy and they want economic growth. By putting our own house in order and making the world safe for growing democracies we can defeat China without firing a shot.“One clear lesson from the past two hundred and fifty years, however, is that political and social stability plays a vital role in long-term economic success, as do free peoples and free markets. Yet even if freedom is necessary for long-term economic success, the current growth malaise (particularly in the freest nation-states) and the startling economic success of politically stable but non-free nations like China together suggest that freedom of markets and citizens alone is not sufficient. History shows that winners in the growth race were led by long-term thinkers with an appetite for risk taking and investment.” Chapter 3: Hurricane Headwinds  “IN THE GREATEST GENERATION, AMERICAN journalist Tom Brokaw describes the emergence of the United States from a period of destitution in the 1930s. The book tells of those born in the early twentieth century who weathered the Great Depression, won the Second World War, established America as the number one global power, and moved the United States from a path of economic decline and depression toward one of mass prosperity. The story of America’s remarkable economic trajectory during those years holds many lessons for us today. During this period of strong and transformational economic growth, the United States operated full throttle on the three key factors of growth: capital, labor, and productivity. Major capital investments included the creation of the expansive interstate highway system beginning in 1956, which by 2017 had reached nearly forty-seven thousand miles, as well as the massive investment in equipment and machines in the agricultural sector, which constituted a significant part of America’s economy. In terms of labor, the G.I. Bill, passed in June 1944 by President Franklin Roosevelt, offered education and other benefits such as business loans to World War II veterans, thereby upgrading the quality of the workforce. Within little over a decade, more than two million veterans had attended college and more than five and a half million had received training thanks to the bill. The quantity of labor increased as well, with the absorption of women into the formal workforce on the home front beginning during the war. These years also saw a marked growth in productivity, prompted in part by technological advancements, including fertilizer, pesticides, and machinery such as combine harvesters, mainframe computing, and manufacturing. Between 1945 and 1975, output per hour of labor (a measure of productivity) increased 127 percent. This tripartite surge in capital, labor, and productivity propelled the US economy forward through the postwar years.Just a few decades later, however, each of these factors now faces severe headwinds. We are living in a period of low growth and even economic stagnation. While it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine where growth will come from, there is ever more clarity on the factors likeliest to derail global growth. This chapter seeks to shed new light on seven hurricane-strength forces barreling down on the global economy. When it comes to capital, these headwinds include high levels of debt, natural resource scarcity, and misallocation of capital. Affecting labor are the declining quality and quantity of the global workforce as a result of demographic shifts and worsening effects of widening income inequality. Finally, total factor productivity (the share of output that comes from variables that are not labor or capital) is sapped by the counterintuitive effects of technological advancement, as well as a decline in the efficiency through which capital and labor can be converted into economic growth.Paradoxically a number of the factors explored here once supported economic growth. New technologies, for instance, once powered industrialization and increased production efficiency. It absolutely can do the same today, albeit, with far less man power. Even though workers lost jobs in the transition, they found new work in new regions and new industries. And they will again, let me show you how. Today, however, jobs are disappearing at an increasing rate as a result of new technologies without any clear alternatives to absorb the workforce.And while the demographic forces of the past supported economic growth, the population shifts of today pose a challenge. The baby boom of the 1950s was positive when that cohort was of working age, but it is now a drag on growth and contributing to ballooning pension and health care costs, since many of that age group are older and retired. A huge difference can be made by county run social security returning it to its original purpose, a safety net that everyone with an income pays into to share the burden of supporting those who have not been able to earn enough of an income to provide themselves with savings in excess of one million dollars and a monthly retirement check over $4,166.67($50,000.00/year) and those who have not been able to earn any income. Here are the strict guide lines that we demand to stabilize Social Security: Twelve thousand dollars per year will be the minimum and thirty-six thousand dollars per year will be the maximum paid to an individual regardless of how much they paid in. Only retirees whose savings and stock holdings are less than one million dollars and their retirement plan pay them less than fifty thousand dollars per year can draw a social security check. For those who fall into this category drawing a check from their own retirement plan that is less than fifty thousand per year, Social Security will still pay only a maximum of thirty-six thousand per year, but it will boost their retirement to fifty thousand per year. Counties will use Social Security for retirement checks only, all other current uses will be paid for by the 15% personal income tax or taken up by  local aid organization or phased out and discontinued.Understanding the seven headwinds described in this chapter is crucial to understanding why the current economic malaise is different from previous economic challenges. So are the policies of protectionism in trade and restriction of immigration, which despite their growing popularity dampen economic growth rather than encourage it. The global economy will only succeed if policymakers can more efficiently allocate resources over the long term and grappling with the gale-force headwinds against growth is a necessary first step.Recycling, robotics and renewable fuels answers the shortage of natural resources, embracing robotics and reentering manufacturing and industry will increase precision, safety, efficiency and productivity. Mass-producing CNC and 3D Printing so that anyone that wants them can afford them can put millions of people to work manufacturing and distributing new inventions starting out in their garage. We need a new commitment to freedom and when the inmate population has grown from 2 million in the 90’s to over 7 million today, rethinking the use of incarceration is a good place to start. By having each state monitor their own ankle bracelets and enhancing them with third eye technology to improve home confinement with the goal of each county monitoring them and sending everyone convicted of murder to the Yukon, we can clear out our prisons and use them to safely vet immigrants and bring relief to Germany and other European country’s overwhelmed by refugees and in so doing, supply big tech with the qualified people to fill that need caused by misguided politicians in Washington that have nearly destroyed our education system.  “LOOMING OMINOUSLY OVER TIMES SQUARE in New York, a debt clock measures the second-by-second change in the gross national debt as well as families’ share in that debt. In 2000, the clock stood at nearly $5.7 trillion. By mid-2005, that figure had grown to approximately $8 trillion, and in 2015, it reached more than $18 trillion. America’s growing national debt has risen to the forefront of political debate. So great was the concern about the level of debt (as well as a lack of agreement in Congress to raise the debt ceiling) that on August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency that grades debt issuers’ ability and willingness to repay what they owe, downgraded the US government for the first time in history.” (According to Jason Chaffetz, the US pays $700 million per day in interest on the national debt.)             “…At relatively low levels, nations and companies alike can benefit from taking on some debt obligations. Borrowing money for investment in the present can lead to future economic gains, especially if borrowing makes the difference between investing and not investing. A modest and manageable amount of borrowing is better than not investing at all. Taking on debt can help pay for important public investments in education, health care, and infrastructure. Debt of this sort has been crucial to US growth over the past century. The approximately $3.8 trillion municipal bond market in the United States allows for the funding of infrastructure and the construction of schools, hospitals, and highways. In the postwar years, municipal borrowing more than tripled from $20 billion in 1945 to $66 billion in 1960, as governments and states invested heavily in building infrastructure. In this way, debt can serve as a catalyst for future economic growth.But there is a limit to debt’s efficacy, as demonstrated in the experience of commodity-driven economies. In periods of rapid economic growth, politicians often borrow from the international capital markets to fund investments, hoping that commodity prices will remain high over the foreseeable future. However, if global commodity prices collapse, or when growth inevitably slows, debt repayments become a larger share of public spending, reducing money earmarked for such needs as education and health care. Worse still, the debt, if priced in foreign currency (for example, in US dollars), becomes much more expensive, as slow growth is often accompanied by a reduction in the value of the home currency versus the US dollar. This mounting debt burden from the greater expense of debt further harms economic growth.The relationship between debt and growth is not linear. Taking on more and more debt does not translate into higher future growth ad infinitum. In fact, the combination of slow growth and fast-rising debt can prove lethal. Today, with global growth relatively stagnant, countries are piling up debt at a faster rate than their economies can expand…”“…Ultimately, there is a short list of prescriptions for escaping the precarious situation of unsustainable debt. The majority of those prescriptions, which include outright default, fiscal austerity, and bailouts, all further contract the economy and worsen prospects for economic growth. Only growth itself, including debt-financed growth if managed in a sustainable way, can lift countries out of high indebtedness in a manner supportive of (or at least not harmful to) a country’s prospects for long-term prosperity. The risk to global debt today is that few of the world’s important economies are pursuing a path of sustainable debt. NATURAL RESOURCES ARE PART OF the assets or capital endowment of a country. Abundant natural resources can position a nation’s economy for strong growth, especially in a world in which those resources are becoming scarce and more valuable. However, the combination of greater global demand and a shrinking supply of commodities poses a dire threat to global economic growth. Ultimately the global forces will influence the fortune of individual nations: a world of depleting natural resources cannot support long-term economic growth.The key commodity inputs to economic growth are arable land, potable water, energy, and minerals. Today, the greatest amount of untilled, arable land is in Africa, yet this land is often hard to access because of un-traversable terrain. In comparison, China, with 1.3 billion people, has only an estimated 11.3 percent arable land. This shortage has served as an impetus for China to go outside its borders in search of commodities and land on which to grow food. China’s systematic and aggressive approach has made it the “go-to” power buyer for commodities and resources. China invested nearly $200 billion globally in 2015, with about a third of the total invested in the energy sector. Potable water is also in increasingly short supply. Although 70 percent of Earth is covered by water, about 97 percent of this water is too salty even to be used to clean toilets. Water is essential not only for drinking but also for manufacturing and food production. The risk of shortage is why such countries as China and Saudi Arabia are investing the most in desalination and are at the forefront of efforts seeking a resolution to water scarcity…”“…Beyond land and water, resources like minerals and energy are becoming ever harder and more expensive to acquire. In the quest for mining and energy resources, producers are seeking out more politically unstable and difficult terrain…”“…But ultimately what places the most pressure on resources is population growth.Over the past fifty years global population growth has been uniquely rapid. As demographers attest, this is a phenomenon never seen in history or prehistory, and one never to be seen again once, by some forecasts, the population plateaus over the course of the next century. This population trend may, in some respects, seem counterintuitive. A swelling global population means more people, more workers, more consumption, and a boost for growth. However, the current population dynamics could entail a much darker future, especially in a world of finite resources.The Worldometers website displays, moment by moment, the number of births and deaths around the world on a daily and annual basis. In total, there are approximately 7.5 billion people on the planet today, …” “…By current forecasts the world population will top 9 billion people by 2050, expanding by an additional 1.2 billion over the next twenty years—an almost 30 percent increase in the world population in a mere forty years…” The solution is simple and highly effective, the World Health Organization must mandate that all new born babies must be given a reversable neuter operation, and to guarantee they are reversable and that all children are treated the same, the US health industry must develop portable robotic doctors that perform this operation with great precision consistently and that video on a micro level so a specialist in the US can be available if an anomaly is encountered that the computer cannot traverse, then the specialist will be able to assist, the computer will prevent all possibility of error by the specialist. When a couple wants a child, they can reverse it to give birth once if this results in more than one child than they will have more than one child through natural child birth, otherwise they will have only one child unless they choose to adopt. The parents will both undergo a reversable neuter operation soon after the successful birth. The people of the US must get real and get over it, whatever it is that makes you argue ad-nauseum the simple and effective answers. The people of the US must be educated enough to realize that population growth is no joke, we can’t debate this issue under the rug, we must lead, even though over population is not yet a problem in this country, it is a world problem that has such dire consequences that we must get ahead of it and lead.“…Urbanization, too, promises to create even greater demand for resources. By 2030 an estimated 60 percent of the world’s population will live in cities. The number of cities of five hundred inhabitants or more is projected to grow by 30 percent in Asia and 80 percent in Africa. Across emerging markets, explicit and managed urbanization policies are under way. For example, the Chinese government has publicly stated policy targets that will increase the number of cities with at least one million people from the current total of around 80 to 221 cities, and over 20 cities with at least ten million people each. To put this in context, Europe and the United States together have 10 cities with at least one million people each…”“…There is a long history of concerns about how natural resources will be unable to keep pace with population demand…”“…The effort to manage scarce natural resources and address the challenge of climate change creates pressures to restrict growth and has created international disputes over what kind of growth is appropriate and sustainable. After all, according to many environmentalists, economic growth itself is degrading the planet. Meanwhile, economists on the other side of the debate worry that growth will be damaged by over prioritization of environmental concerns. There exist compelling arguments for “green growth”—the idea that economic growth can be enhanced by addressing climate change, CO2 emissions, and water scarcity—yet the debate between environmentalists and economists still rages.In some sense, this clash of environmental versus economic viewpoints reflects the tension between the industrialized developed West and the rest. Western policymakers tend to caution emerging countries that, without advocating “green growth” and pursuing a growth agenda that takes environmental concerns into greater consideration, they risk lower quality and worsening economic growth. Emerging market countries are quick to point out that a reckless environmental agenda was the backbone of Western development, and that advanced countries remain among the greatest polluters on the planet. Resolving this tension is key to addressing the natural resource headwind and setting the global economy on a trajectory of higher economic growth. TODAY, CAPITAL IS CONSTRAINED BY high, unsustainable indebtedness and scarce natural resources. One of the three pillars of growth is thus undermined in two different pernicious ways. Simultaneously, the labor market, the second key driver of GDP growth, faces its own headwinds…” “…By 2050, one in six of the global population will be age sixty-five or older, compared to one in twelve in 2015. The aging of the world population is raising the dependency ratio—that is, the ratio of retirees to workers. This surfeit of expensive nonworkers alongside a paucity of productive workers constitutes a major headwind for economic growth.We are moving into a world inhabited by fewer and fewer workers who can actively and productively contribute to economic growth…” This can be turned around, but it will require freeing the world of the downward spiral that China is causing to achieve its own agenda. If we cannot begin releasing ourselves from the programming the CIA believes they developed through the MK Ultra Program but was actually fed to them by China, then China will become the global authority and establish the New World Order achieving their three-thousand-year goal of total world control through programming. Then they will swiftly solve the world population problem by mowing down everyone over the age fourteen. This is nothing new, this is standard operating procedure for China, and it has been well documented throughout southeast Asia over the past 70-years. “…Meanwhile, China risks getting old before getting rich, with some estimates suggesting that half of China’s population will be fifty years old or older by 2050…” This is a nonissue for China, not because they have any compunction about mowing down their own elderly population, they absolutely do not, they have done it at least three times in the past 150 years, but because they are already rich beyond belief, sitting on vast gold reserves the evidence of which they have gone to great extremes to expunge from the historic record.“…As the economically active population shrinks, the population of economically inactive people grows. And all the while, the life expectancy of the aging cohort of baby boomers is increasing. Global life expectancy is expected to rise to seventy-seven years by 2045. This trend brings mounting health care and unfunded pension costs that act as a drag on economic growth. The United Nations forecasts that by 2050 one in three persons living in a rich country will be a pensioner, and nearly one in ten will be over eighty years old. In the United States, the Social Security bill was close to $900 billion in 2015, making it the largest single item in the annual federal government budget, and representing approximately 25 percent of federal expenditures (up from 0.22 percent during World War II). These numbers are, if anything, conservative, as they do not include additional public pension commitments at the state and city levels…”“…All of this is to say that the West is getting older. The less productive and more expensive to maintain this growing aging population becomes, the greater the burden it will place on already stretched fiscal balances and on the economy overall. A country populated by fewer and fewer young and able-bodied workers will inevitably face the prospect of labor shortages, lower productivity, and slowed economic growth.” IT’S NOT JUST THAT THE workforce is dwindling in quantity. An issue of quality is also emerging as a further drag on global growth. Decades of underinvestment in quality education have churned out a working-age population ill-equipped to work or contribute effectively to the modern economy.The global cohort of unemployed youth between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four has now surpassed 71 million…” These demands address these issues and the ways that old methods can be combined with new technology will make it possible for many people to work longer and continue to be productive until they die. Let me show you the way.“…In the United States, the threat of declining workforce quality was clear at least as long ago as 1983. In that year a report produced by the US Department of Education entitled A Nation at Risk clearly stated the problem. “Our once unchallenged pre-eminence in commerce, industry, science and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world,” the report read. “The educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very nature as a nation and a people.”Yet save for relatively small efforts such as the No Child Left Behind legislation, little has been done to address the concerns of A Nation at Risk. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a test administered to fifteen-year-olds throughout the world to compare reading, science, math, and other skills. As of 2015, US students rank thirtieth among the thirty-five OECD members in math skills. Without a dramatic course change, a generation of US students will enter the workplace unequipped to compete.-Wikipedia- The mission of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. The 34 OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Personally, I like this roster, the US should throw the WTO under the bus and concentrate on the OECD.Behind these striking macro statistics are signs of inequality in educational outcomes—and these are disturbing in their implications. The global consulting firm McKinsey summed it up best: “The persistence of these educational achievement gaps imposes on the United States the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.” The report goes on to note that narrowing the gap between black and Latino student performance and white student performance could have resulted in 2008 GDP rising by up to $525 billion, or 4 percent of GDP. Given demographic shifts, the magnitude of this impact will only grow. For the first time in America’s history, its next generation of workers will be less educated than its last. The New Math amounts to no less than psychological abuse of not only the students put through such an ordeal but also of the parents who can’t help their children with it, without returning to school themselves. The wholesale destruction of the Public-School System is now being orchestrated by another one of Pence’s choices that everyone in the media holds Trump responsible for. Trump is now a Republican Mouthpiece spouting off the rhetoric that the GOP have been eager to say but didn’t want to hurt the party by saying it. Now they have Trump under their control whom they can claim, when he is gone, didn’t really reflect the true GOP agenda because he was an outsider. For example, signing an executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship is the classic GOP agenda they have advanced for years while it is directly contradictory to what Donald Trump has said regarding DACA. This is the result of John Kelly being in control of everything Trump says and does. There is a way to help Donald Trump achieve his stated goals of upsetting the status quo by draining the swamp and it is by uniting in support of this full package.However, far more urgent than the problem of rich nations’ aging populations and undereducated workers is the mounting concern about emerging countries’ demographics. Essentially, the young and increasingly educated workforce is underutilized in developing economies that have too little economic growth to create job opportunities for them. The burgeoning population across the emerging markets is generally skewed young—with upwards of 60 percent of the population under twenty-five. Meanwhile, students in emerging market countries have outperformed in the PISA tests, moving to the very top of the global league tables. While a young, well-educated workforce should be an asset to a developing nation, stalled economic growth makes them a burden on society and a further drag on economic growth. Spur the emerging market by bringing the kind of business the workforce is educated to do to the country or US community where the workforce is located or invite the “students in emerging market countries” to the US to fill the high tech needs they are qualified to do, a Trump initiative that was crushed, not by the democrats but by the members of his own party. Donald Trump is an asset Mike Pence is a liability. Just sit there and do nothing and watch what happens when they impeach Donald Trump. You won’t be watching it on TV, you’ll be living it when you’re getting your meal from McDonalds out of a dumpster. Just ask the people of Venezuela.  ALONGSIDE CAPITAL AND LABOR, A third factor that drives economic growth is encapsulated by the term “total factor productivity” (TFP). Three economic headwinds holding back TFP are the role of new technology in the creation of an unemployed underclass, growing income inequality, and declining “pure” productivity, which is to say declining output per worker.In 1930, the British economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that economic growth and “technical improvements” would lead to a fifteen-hour workweek by 2030. Today, less than fifteen years from that date, technological innovations continue to increase productivity—and to increase the possibility that production may be able to take place without requiring human workers at all.” What could be better, higher productivity, greater precision, lower costs mean lower prices on American made products when we fully embrace technology to reenter manufacturing and industry nationwide. We will need all of the labor we can get at every skill level to put this new industry and manufacturing on line, and when it’s completed and everything, we need is manufactured stateside new businesses will have emerged due to CNC and 3D Printers in home garages producing many new products. What I intend to hold as my hole card combining old methods with new technology will provide employment for anyone able and willing to work for as long as they want to do it and it will be very enjoyable work that people will want to do and will be disappointed if they are no longer able. “…Historically, technology advances have on balance created economic growth and improved living standards. Human progress proceeded despite monumental shocks from the agricultural and industrial revolutions. For example, the diminution of the US agricultural sector was correlated with the dramatic improvements in living standards in the United States in the twentieth century. In the early 1900s, approximately 50 percent of the US population was employed in some aspect of the agricultural sector. Over the century, technology and machine advancements replaced the agricultural labor workforce, and today less than 2 percent of Americans work in farming…”“…With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that the majority of farming labor was deployed into manufacturing and industry jobs. But today, the policymakers charged with avoiding destabilizing levels of job losses in the economy are frustrated that they cannot predict which new sector can absorb millions of low-skilled workers who are displaced by automation. Nor can they reasonably assess how quickly technology’s full impact might make itself felt. Although the technology sector promises new jobs in biomedicine, data analytics, and coding, many of these opportunities are not yet tangible…”“…a world of less work and cheaper goods and services certainly seems appealing…”“…In such a world, what would people actually do?”Think about it! A 2015 OXFAM REPORT PROCLAIMED that the richest 1 percent in the world owns nearly half of the world’s wealth, and their 2017 report announced that the eight richest people are worth more than the world’s poorest 50 percent. Behind the widening gap in wealth is an increase in income inequality between the richest and the poorest. As income inequality has increased (so that the incomes of the poor have substantially fallen behind those of the rich), it has become more difficult for the poor to increase their wealth. The key reason that income inequality has climbed to the top of the international policy agenda over the past decade is its ever-increasing impact on economic growth. Once considered largely neutral in its effect, there are now good reasons to believe that income inequality is indeed a headwind. When the richest 1% put Third Eye technology to use they will be embarrassed by their selfishness and they will find their own ways to make it right. Therefore, there is no need to concern ourselves’ with this issue. They are not politicians, for the most part, so they won’t be required to make use of this technology, but they will want to.According to the OECD the relationship between growing income inequality and slowing economic growth is one not just of correlation but of causation. The world’s leading industrialized economies have lost a combined 8.5 percent of GDP over the last twenty-five years because of worsening income inequality. By the OECD’s estimates, income inequality has accounted for a decline in economic growth on the order of approximately 6 percent for the United States and 9 percent for the United Kingdom and Norway. (paraphrased) Growing income inequality is one of the hurricane  headwinds causing economic growth to slow down.To be clear, over the past few decades inequality between countries’ incomes has actually improved, as poorer economies have posted significant economic growth, converging toward average income levels in wealthier countries. However, within these countries, income inequality has worsened considerably. In the United States, for example, the average income of the top 1 percent is fourteen times higher than the average income of the rest of the population. In 1978, it was just ten times higher. Forbes annually lists the four hundred wealthiest people in the United States. According to the Institute for Policy Studies, “With a combined worth of US$2.34 trillion, the Forbes 400 own more wealth than the bottom 61 percent of the country combined, a staggering 194 million people.” (paraphrased) According to the OECD the relationship between growing income inequality and slowing economic growth is one not just of correlation but of causation. The four hundred wealthiest people in the United States own more wealth than a staggering 194 million people. Growing income inequality is one of the hurricane  headwinds causing economic growth to slow down. Chapter 4: The False Promise of Protectionism “…The principles of globalization are enshrined in the Washington Consensus, codified in 1990 by economist John Williamson. Williamson focused on free trade in goods and services, cross-border capital flows, the movement of people, and the preeminence of the private sector as an engine for economic success. These became the template for economic policy for more than twenty-five years.Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in 2016 represent a profound challenge to the Washington Consensus. Much of the criticism leveled against globalization today is related to the idea that it enriches the few, leaving the many behind. Those making this argument frequently advocate the wholesale abandonment of globalization, putting the very existence of an international agenda at risk.This challenge to the Washington Consensus has been a long time coming. Politicians today are paying the price for decades of expedient short-term policymaking that has run counter to the thesis of globalization. While politicians have been advocating open-door trade policies over the last several decades, in reality trade and immigration policies with a more protectionist stance have prevailed over genuinely free trade. This diluted form of globalization failed to create equitable growth, permitted the economy to stagnate, and left politicians vulnerable to the millions of disaffected voters who blame globalization itself for their deteriorating circumstances.Rather than make the increasingly difficult case for globalization, the leaders of leading nations are pivoting toward greater isolationism. Leaders who once embraced globalization, as well as new leaders standing on a platform of isolationism, are moving toward protecting local industries through higher trade tariffs and their labor markets, along with increased immigration control, in attempts to boost domestic employment. However, this fresh cycle of short-term thinking further undermines long-term economic growth.History has shown that when developed countries start on a path of protectionist policies that lead to greater isolationism, other countries are forced to follow suit. The risk is a great unraveling of globalization. This chapter seeks to reckon with protectionism’s consequences on trade, capital flows, and immigration and to highlight the perils of the deglobalized world that myopic policymakers are constructing. History also shows that temporary protectionism can right a ship of state careening dangerously off course. Limited protectionism is always required to keep the majority of boats afloat. Globalization cannot “lift all boats” when one of its major tenets is survival of the fittest. In truth International Corporations don’t have a chance. Globalization feeds the dragon. Providing slave labor to International Corporations, showing all the signs of a transparent business partner that respects property rights, this is only pretense to draw its prey into the mouth of the dragon. For investors to fall for this scheme is to ignore history. History tells us: “The dragon was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” TO UNDERSTAND THE FATES WE potentially face, it’s worth exploring what globalization means in practice. Globalization can be seen as a spectrum—at one end of the spectrum is a world with no globalization, where states exist in total isolation from one another, while at the other end is full globalization, characterized by unfettered movement of goods, services, capital, and people. In practice, full isolation and full globalization are abstract ideals; neither exists in pure form in reality. In general, most countries operate in between these extremes, adopting a middle-of-the-road approach to openness and internationalism—a globalization-lite regime, as it were.Theoretically, under a fully isolationist approach, policies are nakedly protectionist, limiting global trade (through the imposition of higher trade tariffs and quotas, and competitive currency devaluations), capping cross-border capital flows, and curbing immigration. In each case, the goal is to strengthen the domestic economy by protecting jobs and shielding the local economy from the costs of global competitive forces. However, history shows that protectionism causes economic weakness, costs jobs, and slows economic growth. One of the clearest examples can be seen in the almost nine hundred import duties raised by the Smoot-Hawley regime in the 1930s, which led to dire consequences for employment and GDP. Strict and high capital requirements (aimed at making banks stronger) can drastically limit international lending, significantly cap cross-border flows, and thereby constrain investment in the real economy. Ultimately this isolationist stance of higher erected national borders is to the detriment of growth and living standards. Simply the wrong approach. That’s all.The other extreme is an ideal of complete globalization, in which trade, capital, and even labor flow freely across national borders as if they do not exist. This pure form of globalization rests on the idea of comparative advantage—whereby one country carries out a particular economic activity (Old George, ‘You will specialize.’) (such as making a specific product) more efficiently than others. Trade, capital, and labor (If they use robots why do they need labor.) then flow to where they can derive the greatest economic benefit. (Hold on, now I get it, ‘one country carries out a particular economic activity’ you’re nakedly talking about a world where only communist States exist. China is the Global Authority that assigns communist States the role they will play, and China will move the pawns to where they are needed most. Now I get it. So, what your saying is that you’re against globalization because this is a world in which democracy doesn’t exist.) As everyone grows and produces the goods and services for which they have the greatest comparative advantage, not only do their wages rise, but by earning more they have more opportunity to buy more and higher-quality goods and services from across the world. The promise of globalization, according to this ideal, is that “everyone wins,” (That sounds ideal, but would it ever be true, China makes everything, and slave labor makes it cheaper than anyone else would care to try to compete with. Property rights, transparency in business dealings with China. Really, it seems to me that when US citizens discovered that the sheetrock on their walls was corroding copper pipes and copper wiring and causing respiratory problems in the people living in the homes, they discovered that the sheetrock was made in China. They did the only thing they could do, they identified people victimized by the attack on American citizens in their homes and filed a class action lawsuit and what was the result? China refused to identify the state-owned manufacturer. The lawsuits allege sulfur compound levels in the drywall are too high, causing issues with air conditioning systems, electrical appliances, internal wiring and other electrical systems in homes. Plaintiffs also claim the contaminated drywall produces a rotten egg-like stench and causes a variety of respiratory and other health problems for those who live in the affected homes. The lawsuits filed so far have named Chinese-based manufacturers, as well as importers, developers and builders, contractors, suppliers and others. - Lawyers & Settlements.com. Globalization that includes China as a participant is filled with risks, but for now we must be patient.  A 15% tariff on all imports would be smarter than weaponizing tariffs.)   with notable economic gains flowing to citizens across the world—whether based in developed or developing countries, or provider of labor or capital. In the view of some globalization advocates, if this has not happened in practice, it is not because the idea of globalization itself is problematic; it is because its implementation has not gone far enough.What prevails instead is a middle ground of partially implemented globalization. Indeed, it is unclear whether full globalization can ever truly be implemented under current conditions. The real world is characterized by a mishmash of bilateral (as opposed to global) trade agreements that reflect national interests and political expediency. Despite efforts to the contrary, capital flows and immigration decisions are made by national authorities. This middle ground of globalization is a direct product of zero-sum thinking—the idea that in key policy decisions and their implementation, nations are essentially winners or losers. It is also a product of the short-term mentality of policymakers who are oblivious to the true costs and consequences, borne tomorrow, of the policy decisions they make today. In effect, policymakers are paying the price for not pursuing and implementing a purer form of total globalization.The unavoidable conclusion of the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump is that globalization has failed to deliver all things to all people. Instead of benefiting from a globalizing world, many millions of people are instead suffering under worsening living standards and falling real wages, groaning under mounting personal debt and lack of opportunity. Rather than lifting all boats as promised, greater globalization and global integration in trade, capital flows, and immigration have created pockets of losers whose objections to a global world order have seeped into political discourse. “In December 2010, a poor Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi lit himself on fire to protest the arbitrary expropriation of his goods and his economic future. Within weeks Bouazizi’s act of self-immolation precipitated the Arab Spring revolutions, as under the slogan of “Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam” (“People demand removal of the regime”) protests spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunisia to Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Sudan, and Yemen. Today, that region is in the midst of what some are likening to a modern Thirty Years War.”  Ignore them, better yet, label them as terrorists and kill them, don’t give them a voice, they don’t deserve to be heard, they’re losers, to be grinded under our goose-stepping boots. No one should forget the lyrics of another Chinese Mouth Piece: “One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.” Sorry, I’m going to try to resist my purple passion.Globalization’s success seemed almost inevitable until just a few years ago. As recently as 2014, experts predicted that “trade would grow twice as fast as GDP while international investment and information flows scaled new peaks.” Yet according to the Financial Times just two years later, “flows of finance, goods and services have slowed—falling from a peak of 53 percent of global output in 2007 to 39 percent in 2014”—evidence that in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, trade and capital flows have been hit hard. While globalization helped to improve living standards and foster growth in a number of developed companies beginning as early as the 1990s, it also created new economic problems. In the case of Mexico, and Latin America more generally, globalization and greater market openness led to greater government indebtedness, recession, and banking-sector stress, and efforts to address these aspects intensified the costs and accentuated cycles of economic booms and busts. The North American Free Trade agreement (NAFTA) opened trade to Mexico, granting the country access to capital investment. As a result, the Mexican government was able to increase its borrowing in US dollars. Political instability led to the devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994, precipitating capital flight and a spike in inflation to over 50 percent. Mexico’s so-called Tequila Crisis proved to be an early warning of the risks that came with globalization and the opening of free trade. It prompted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reexamine its efforts to promote open capital markets and integration. It also prompted other countries to question the benefits of free trade.”“…What we are seeing may amount to the biggest drop-off in the overall level of globalization since World War II. In the run-up to the financial crisis, the mantra of many economists and politicians was that globalization was good for growth. But now there is a rising din of concern that globalization might be not only correlated with worsening living standards (declining real wages in the United States and across Europe, widening income inequality) but also a catalyst for these economic ills. (paraphrased) Globalization is a catalyst for declining real wages, widening income inequality and worsening living standards.Therefore, as the world settles into a period of low growth, politicians and policymakers are grasping at politically expedient policy measures to attempt to salvage their economies in the short term, such as pulling out of trade deals (such as the United States did with the Trans-Pacific Partnership) and imposing new trade tariffs. Protectionism is on the rise. Led by the United States, the G20 imposed 644 discriminatory trade measures on other countries in 2015, according to Global Trade Alert. In the wake of intensified capital controls on banks, cross-border capital flows have been in decline.Many of these threaten longer-term economic prospects. Bad policy leads to the misallocation of scarce resources. Not only does this have a negative effect on GDP in the long term, but it kills off economic growth and foments political instability in the short term, further discouraging much-needed investment. As these phenomena worsen economic growth, additional bad policy decisions aimed at short-term gain will only worsen the cycle. As we attempt to overcome the headwinds preventing us from achieving growth, we must avoid misguided solutions that attempt (sometimes in good faith) to save us from chaos but will end up pushing us over the edge instead.The rising disaffection with globalization cannot be ignored. The concerns are valid; many people have lost out and been left behind as internationalization has gathered momentum. Millions of emerging market farmers have been shut out of trade zones, while many workers, particularly in the manufacturing sector of developing countries, have seen their wages fall as globalization has taken hold. Protectionist, multibillion-dollar programs—such as the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (just under 40 billion euros per annum) and farm subsidies in the United States (around US$20 billion a year)—prop up domestic producers at the expense of emerging economies. These unfair trade practices not only are antithetical (mutually incompatible) to the ideals of globalization but also have a devastating impact on the income and living standards of farmers in South America, Africa, and Asia, who are unable to compete with subsidized rivals in the West. The result is a dramatic drop in the amount of proceeds from trade available for much-needed investment in infrastructure in emerging economies. And this has resulted in slower growth across the developing world, home to more than 80 percent of the world’s population. I agree with your assessment of the ill effects of farm subsidies, but it is at least worth noting that you don’t take issue with the fact that virtually all of the flood of products that China uses to destroy fair market competition are government subsidized by a state-owned slave labor force.The protectionism around farming in developed countries is an example of how globalization has been compromised. Essentially, as stated above, these shortcomings identified here are not of globalization so much as of globalization’s incompleteness. People’s concerns around globalization are valid; however, their concerns are not with globalization per se as much as they are about the halfhearted and skewed way globalization has unfolded. Put another way: they think they are objecting to globalization when in fact they are objecting to an incomplete and impure form of globalization that has benefited too few people. (paraphrased) ‘Full globalization is an abstract ideal that doesn’t exist in pure form in reality.’ To be sure, some in developed and developing economies have benefited from globalization, but it is also true that large pockets of society—such as farmers in the developing world and manufacturing and industrial workers in the West—have suffered in an increasingly integrated international regime.The results of a University of Chicago study harden the resolve of those who believe globalization has had limited benefit. In a presentation entitled “What Future for Capitalism?” University of Chicago professor Luigi Zingales has compared the economic growth performance of developed and developing nations in what he terms the pre-globalization period (1950–1980) versus the globalization period of 1980–2007. As Zingales reveals, developed economies such as France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden all registered declines during the globalization era, and no discernible increase in economic growth. The study shows that at the macro level, only large emerging market economies have benefited. These include India, which nearly doubled from 2 percent to 3.8 percent, and China, which grew from 3.2 percent to 8.8 percent in the pre-globalization and globalization periods, respectively.The last three and a half decades have offered the potential for broad-based wage growth, but the vast majority of people have seen few of these economic gains. Real wages have suffered, hurting living standards for many workers in developed economies and around the world. For example, German real wages declined by 4.5 percent from 2000 to 2009. And, according to the Economic Policy Institute, “ever since 1979, the vast majority of American workers have seen their hourly wages stagnate or decline. This is despite real GDP growth of 149 percent and net productivity growth of 64 percent.” A 2015 Pew survey notes that, “after adjusting for inflation, today’s average hourly wage has just about the same purchasing power as it did in 1979, following a long slide in the 1980s and early 1990s and bumpy, inconsistent growth since then. In fact, in real terms the average wage peaked more than 40 years ago: The US$4.03-an-hour rate recorded in January 1973  has the same purchasing power as US$22.41 would today.” (Minimum wage was $1.60 in 1973, 40% $4.03 and it’s $7.85 in 2018, 35% of $22.41.) Whatever the cause of these trends—whether jobs moving offshore to lower-cost countries or automation replacing workers—they are serving as a catalyst for protectionism and more aggressive deglobalization.Although there are real frustrations prompting the rising anti-globalization chorus, these flaws ultimately have less to do with the ideal of globalization itself than with the inferior form of globalization that policymakers have implemented over recent decades—a kind of globalization lite. “The promise of globalization, according to this ideal, is that “everyone wins,” with notable economic gains flowing to citizens across the world—whether based in developed or developing countries, or provider of labor or capital.” It’s clear to me that you really believe this, but how does any small local business compete with an international corporation and how does the ideal form of globalization cause “notable economic gains flowing to citizens across the world”, all by itself. Globalization has no mechanism for gains in the form of increasing wages. Does it? The mantra of globalization “everyone wins,” in reality is the mantra of the Chinese Pied Piper leading the world to the edge of chaos and preparing to boot us into the abyss, but China has broken all of the rules of human rights and the world will no longer ignore this fact as it prepares to, once again, mow down a large portion of its own population.Given the unsettling political portents, it is understandable that politicians and policymakers today are responding to the electorate’s grievances against globalization…”It seems to me, ma’am, that you make a stronger argument against globalization yourself than in its favor. You have succinctly pointed out that governments most important duty is to play a role in their country’s economy that “lifts all boats”, but how else, if not by using some minimal form of protectionism? Nascent democracies who’s official seeks aid from China don’t plan on being a democracy for very long, that’s for sure. ON MARCH 4, 1933, IN his first presidential speech, Franklin Roosevelt stated: “Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy.” Roosevelt’s protectionist approach is a common one among politicians when their economies are under pressure and they themselves feel pressed to act. A protectionist stance may be appealing and even understandable in the immediate term. Such an approach can appear to protect jobs in an economic down cycle. But in the long term, it not only harms the nation’s economy but can diminish growth globally as well. Today, dismantling our globalized economy in an uncoordinated and unilateral fashion, nation by nation, is having devastating effects on trade, capital, and labor.Certainly, since the 2008 global financial crisis, trade, a central pillar of globalization, has deteriorated. As nations erect trade barriers and avoid new free trade agreements to try to stop the bleeding in their own economies, billions of dollars are blocked from entering the veins of global commerce. (So, when a man’s throat is cut, he’ll be stronger if he can survive with increased amounts of plasma. Is that what you’re saying? This seems to me to be a perfect correlation because the odds of survival are the same. If  FDR had not used the protectionist methods that saved our country from the “The Great Depression” when he did, it likely would have been far more difficult, if not impossible for him to forge his massive military expansion to save the world from communist aggression during WWII. Make no mistake about it, Fascism and Nazi-ism are communism. The fact that Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Mau Zedong had the exact same psychological program is the proof and Xi is repeating these same tactics in China today.) Many nations are employing tariffs and quotas to raise the prices of imported goods and services, in favor of local producers. In the European Union, tariffs, quotas, export bans—from bananas to rare earths—have weighed down global trade. Already there is considerable evidence that global trade is diminishing. In 2013, the World Trade Organization revised its forecast for global trade growth down from 4.5 percent to 3.3 percent—a striking decline from the average 5.3 percent growth of the previous twenty-five years. According to the Financial Times, “[2015] saw the biggest collapse in the value of goods traded around the world since 2009, when the impact of the global financial crisis was at its worst.” “…The turn to protectionism now is merely the latest in a series of shortsighted decisions that began in the early years of globalization and would go on to undermine it. First, leaders squandered the windfall from trade and failed to invest in longer-term, economic growth–enhancing projects. Far-sighted US politicians in the 1980s would have backed a big investment agenda in infrastructure, schools, and skills to usher in a new economic era on the back of the wealth earned from globalization, thereby avoiding declines in wages and employment. However, this did not occur.Second, rather than end protectionist policies protecting their farmers, Western governments instead kept farm subsidies in place and sought to compensate emerging countries for lost income through billions of dollars of foreign aid flows. However, foreign aid programs have been a catastrophe, fueling corruption, leading to inflation, killing off export sectors, supporting political factions, and fostering dependency. Moreover, the United States has provided low-interest loans to Middle America, especially to support home ownership. These debt programs (particularly through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) gave people the illusion that their livelihoods were improving even as their wages were falling, and debt obligations were rising. This debt was a direct cause of the financial crisis that many are yet to emerge from. In both instances economic growth has, over the long term, suffered.Finally, national interests remained paramount, despite the emergence of a global world order. Today’s form of globalization is one in which no one is responsible for the global economic interest. To give effective globalization a chance, national governments would need to cede real power and authority to global institutions. Under the current circumstances national governments  turning over authority to global institutions would be irresponsible, and that’s the nicest way I can put it ma’am. Two chapters of Edge of Chaos are devoted to China’s economic dominance of the world over the past forty years. “CHINA HAD GONE FROM BEING the richest economy in the world in the nineteenth century to one of the poorest by 1950, only to reemerge over the last four decades as an economic powerhouse while shifting the balance of global power toward the East.” The problem with this economic statement is that China’s economy may well have been one of the poorest by 1950 but it remained the richest country in the world in terms of gold reserves. I just did a little research on gold reserves and according to one chart the US has the largest gold reserves in the world more than twice as much as #2 Germany. With China back in 6th place. There’s a reason why Bloomberg says that China is the “Gold Giant” and it’s not because they’re just now digging it up. How much gold is in Fort Knox and how much gold is in China? One thing is certain, no one in the West knows the true answer to either question. It may not be found on your Chinese made computer but there is a long, written history of Chinese duped Monarchies bringing gold from all parts of the earth to China for trading goods, these Kings even used gold to trade for tea. Such international agencies do exist: for example, the World Trade Organization is supposed to preside over trade, and the IMF maintains oversight over international capital flows. But even these institutions are answerable and superseded by policy agendas of national governments, and thus struggle to implement a truly global agenda that benefits all. Wikipedia - The Director-General supervises the WTO and is appointed by WTO members for a term of four years. Sad!Politicians, especially those in political systems with short electoral cycles that force them to vie constantly to win the next near-term election, are unlikely to cede power and authority to a supranational agency. Therefore, the question becomes whether policymakers can take any action to limit the costs that globalization imposes on the losers without jettisoning the whole globalization agenda and letting nation-states become more protectionist. Put another way: Can public policy mitigate the costs to the losers in a globalization-lite world? Historical evidence to this effect is not encouraging. Globalization HEAVY would be a disaster of astronomical proportions in today’s world. It will never be the answer in a world that favors democracy. Striking the ideal balance between protectionism and globalism must be the goal to nurture nascent democracies. Limited, fair protectionism is the “action to limit the costs that globalization imposes on the, would be, losers without jettisoning the whole globalization agenda.” Farm subsidies have been an enormous disaster to the people of the United States of America, and it is a thorn in the side of globalization. It also represents how the US Federal Government and Europe have been led around as if we have rings in our noses, forced to sacrifice manufacturing to China and to be slaves to making sure Russia and China have enough food. You can be sure that this will be a factor in the world of tomorrow.“…The globalization agenda was designed to integrate countries by easing the trade in goods and services, the flow of capital, and the movement of people across borders. Over the last thirty years, and despite recent retrenchment, globalization has succeeded to some extent on the first two scores. But it has done much less with regard to the movement of people. And if anything, the 2016 Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump on an anti-immigration platform have shown that national governments seem to be moving further away from globalization’s aspirations. The 2015 European refugee crisis exemplifies how the movement of people has never fully been integrated into a global regime, despite it being a key pillar of the globalization agenda. Because immigration has remained the purview of individual nation-states, rather than coordinated across borders, this backdrop has led to a disorderly movement of people and ultimately moments of crisis, as in 2015.The over one million refugees who have arrived in Europe since 2015 make up just a small part of the over sixty-five million people displaced by war or persecution—the largest number in recorded history. But the present refugee crisis marks the first time in history that the European Union has been tasked with accommodating so many people from outside the continent, including new arrivals from Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, particularly in such a disruptive and disorderly fashion.Although labor quality and quantity are key inputs of all canonical economic models of economic growth, there remains no globally integrated approach to migration to correspond to the international frameworks, agencies, rules, and regulations that govern capital, in the form of trade and cross-border flows, and productivity, largely driven by the spread of ideas. Labor policy remains the purview of nation-states, whose approaches often differ dramatically. For example, whereas Canada and Australia make immigration decisions based on a point system (which grants weights to academic achievement, work experience, and so forth), the United States does not have as transparent a grading system for new immigrants.The lack of a globally integrated immigration approach is a form of protectionism that hurts economic growth. According to the International Labour Organization, there are approximately 73.4 million young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four who are out of work around the world. The global labor imbalance is particularly pronounced when you consider the worsening demographic dynamics of an aging population in the “West” (including Japan), versus the skew to the young in the rest, where up to 70 percent of the population is under the age of twenty-five. Deploying labor from countries of surplus to regions of deficit could serve to solve this imbalance. Countries that face a dearth of labor already tap the global talent pool in a unilateral way by attracting labor through guest worker programs and specialized visas. However, these unilateral approaches can be inefficient in that they impose caps on the movement of labor, thereby leaving pools of talent underutilized. A global policy that targeted an optimal migration level could capitalize on the pools of workers around the world.Such a proposition is contentious. The debate on immigration is complicated by two factors: first, its impact on inequality, and second, its links to state-sponsored welfare systems. Immigration increases the labor pool and thereby reduces labor costs; thus, it is seen as attractive to large businesses and wealthier individuals who might wish to employ cheaper labor in jobs ranging from caregiving for children and the elderly to construction. But lower-income workers often see immigration as increasing the competition for finite jobs, forcing their own incomes downward and reducing their living standards. As a general rule, the greater the proportion of lower-skilled workers within an immigrant population, the greater the downward pressure on wages, which in turn worsens income inequality…”  IN 2012, THE New York Times Magazine featured a report from Greece on how ordinary people were faring amidst a wrenching depression: “A quarter of all Greek companies have gone out of business since 2009, and half of all small businesses in the country say they are unable to meet payroll. The suicide rate increased by 40 percent in the first half of 2011.… Nearly half the population under 25 is unemployed.” The reporter concluded: “Greece is devolving into something unprecedented in modern Western experience.”At the time feverish Greek demonstrations against its economic collapse, austerity, and globalization were largely seen as a view from the fringe. Riots and protests across the country that started in 2008 were still continuing in 2017. Today, Brexit and Trump tell us these sentiments—once perhaps hidden—are now central to political debate. Whether it was debt or globalization or a combination of both that precipitated Greece’s economic woes is almost immaterial; the protests represented an outright rejection of globalization and the international bodies such as the European Union and the IMF that were imposing global policies in the national context. The demonstrations were not just about better public management; the austerity Greece faced was seen as objectionable also because it was deemed necessary by foreign (global) dictate. Meanwhile, at a macro level, Greece’s GDP per capita fell from US$32,000 in 2008 to US$18,000 in 2015, and with the exception of some weak growth in 2014, the economy has been contracting ever since it first shrunk in the final quarter of 2008. The country’s debt-to-GDP levels has risen to close to 180 percent—among the highest in the region. Living standards have deteriorated considerably, with more than 45 percent of young adults unemployed and more than a third of the country’s total population classified as being at risk of indigence or social exclusion.For many policymakers today, the fear of losing control of their economies to outside forces and becoming “another Greece” is tempting them to pivot toward quick-fix protectionist policies that in the long term are likely to inhibit economic growth and spark more turmoil. Trade protectionism, capital flow diminution, and restrictions on migration are all likely to reduce the investment needed to power growth.First, a decidedly more siloed world—of higher trade barriers and more biting restrictions on capital repatriation—will force businesses to adopt more local and less global business models. In essence, businesses will be more likely to adopt a federal structure, relying on local and regional capital, and will be less likely to be centrally run from leading financial centers. This change will significantly alter how businesses fund themselves, how they structure costs, and how they view the long-term growth proposition.” All of which could be improved by decentralizing, in business it’s called delegating, historically it has brought new life to big businesses that had faith in people.“…Already, many countries protect their key industries and companies. In 2013, Russia was ranked as the most protectionist country in the world by Global Trade Alert, an independent trade-monitoring think tank. Russia has a list of forty-five industries, including finance, oil/energy, broadcasting, and publishing, where foreign investment is subject to government approval. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) serves a similar function, though the turn toward protectionism may lead it to take a more aggressive role. CFIUS made headlines in late 2016, when then-President Obama blocked the Chinese acquisition of a German computer chip manufacturer with US subsidiaries. Though the Obama administration explained that its actions were motivated by national security concerns, the Financial Times reported on calls by members of Congress of both parties to broaden CFIUS’s mandate, permitting it to apply a more stringent economic benefits test to prevent foreign acquisitions of US companies. Greater capital requirements and restrictions to repatriate capital will invariably limit the ability to invest across borders and will thus limit growth for companies, countries, and the global economy as a whole. These trends are inimical to economic development and progress, placing global investment and commerce in grave danger in terms of profits and returns. They threaten to upend equity and bond markets, foreign exchange, commodity prices, corporate investment decisions, and global trade. Left unchecked, the result will be more destruction of the global economy, greater despair and unrest, conflict, corruption, and a sense of utter hopelessness. ACROSS THE WORLD, CITIZENS ARE angry and chalk their frustrations up to globalization. Although their worsening economic realities justify their angst, in reality globalization is not to blame. Public policy has settled for a globalization lite, rather than allowing full globalization a genuine chance to “lift all boats.” Globalization makes markets more efficient, increases competition, and spreads wealth more equally around the world. Such is the promise of full globalization. This is strictly an unverified theory. Globalization’s promise of the ability to “lift all boats” increase competition and spread wealth more equally around the world without an equal dose of protectionism is unsupported by your own data. In fact, I would argue that your own data proves that, at least some level of protectionism is absolutely required to “lift all boats.” But these are just empty promises along the same line that the promises of communism are just empty promises because a guiding principle of globalism, like capitalism is that it weeds out inefficiency by putting the inefficient out of business. But the truth of capitalism exemplified by the effects of shopping malls is that nationwide businesses can undercut local businesses prices as long as it takes to put locals out of business. This has proven to be much quicker and more ruthless on the global level. The capitalist rule might read, “if you can’t swim with the sharks it’s better to get out quick,” while the globalist precept should read “if you can’t swim with the killer whales, self-immolation  is the most effective way to warn your fellowman.” Despite this scathing description I do believe that achieving the ideal sustainable economic growth will require greater amounts of globalism than protectionism, but this will call for an emerging curve for nascent democracies. Your wrong though, you know, the Chinese model can be duplicated, it won’t be pretty though, if the hot breath of death blows across the earth in the form of a world cultural revolution. Cultural Revolution is China’s ideal approach to nation building because it thoroughly crushes the will to resist. I don’t see voting rights for the Chinese people in a thousand years unless something dramatic sweeps through the far east that the Chinese leadership finds to be an acceptable way for them to strive to escape the bondage of their history and it is effective. Until then, we must find a way to put ourselves on a course to unprecedented transparency that can pay-off the national debt with remarkable speed, set and stick to, long term economic goals.But rather than reaching for this goal, global public policymakers who are faced with backlash have been shifting globalization into reverse, away from the globalization ideal. Under pressure to show results, policymakers around the world are pivoting toward inferior political and economic models. The trends discussed in this chapter—the diminution of global trade, the collapse of cross-border capital flows, mounting constraints on the movement of labor, and deglobalization—point to the misallocation of two major factors of production: capital and labor. They lead inexorably to deteriorating living standards and greater geopolitical unrest. Not only do they pose a threat to the future of economic growth, but they have helped to set in motion a global economic death spiral. Chapter 5: A Challenge to Democracy’s DominanceIN KENYA, THE CAMPAIGN POSTERS have come down. The polling booths have closed. Following a hard-fought election in 2013, the country’s new president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has taken the oath of office and is preparing to leave on his first major foreign trip. For newly elected leaders in emerging countries, this represents a high-profile rite of passage. They visit the country that is, for them, a beacon of progress, a partner in prosperity, and a model to emulate. With a wave from the tarmac, President Kenyatta boards his plane and takes off—not west, toward the White House, but east, toward China’s Great Hall of the People.To billions in the developing world, the value of free peoples and free markets—ascendant in the aftermath of the Cold War—is no longer axiomatic (a self-evident truth). Instead, under intense pressure to deliver more, better, and faster growth, governments in the developing world are being drawn down an alternative path. Embodied by the meteoric rise of China—though hardly limited to it—this new paradigm of a less democratic, more authoritarian state capitalism promises a sure path to success.On the surface, this model’s embrace of greater state intervention in the economy purports to solve many of the immediate economic and demographic challenges dogging the world’s emerging nations. It promises rapid economic growth for disaffected youth, massive reduction of poverty, badly needed infrastructure improvements on an epic scale, and solutions to social problems such as the provision of health care and education. But while this economic and political model holds tantalizing promise in the short term, it places the world on a dangerous path in the longer term. For all of its seductive, immediate appeal, the alternate path to prosperity that is sweeping the developing world is decidedly inferior to Western liberal ideology, liberal democracy, and market capitalism. Especially since it is strictly pretense, a means to an end.When the state eschews a robust private sector in favor of tightly gripping the reins of the national economy, protectionism rises, innovation suffers, and in the long run growth can stagnate. State capitalism encourages just the sort of protectionism and preference for national champions that, as the previous chapter showed, can harm growth. Emphasizing the correlation between trade and economic growth, the IMF’s economic advisor Maurice Obstfeld stated that the backlash against globalization “threatens to halt or even reverse the post-war trend of ever-more open trade.” Emerging markets are turning to this new approach to put out the fires of social and political unrest that are smoldering around the world. Paradoxically, this model will only fan the flames. With authoritarian state capitalism, individual rights and freedoms are deprioritized in favor of collectivism, which curtails innovation and in turn damages long-term economic growth. While China’s state-centric economic approach is well documented, less well-known is the fact that this tectonic ideological shift toward state capitalism has accelerated across emerging markets in recent years. This alternative path is specifically appealing to emerging economies that are hungry for economic growth. If it weren’t for this chapter, I’d have sworn you were cheering for your global authority to be tossed in Chinas lap. But maybe even with all of this research that shouts out that China is the greatest infiltrator and manipulator the world has ever known, as well as, the driving force behind the globalization effort, economists haven’t recognized the truth. China has been able to set itself up as the world’s greatest benefactor of globalism, these things are in no way a coincidence. All of the money China is willing to put into broadband in Turkey, rare earths in WV, and all of the infrastructure in Africa, it’s all strictly pretense, the means to an end, to be appointed THE GLOBAL AUTHORITY leading to total world control,  and to force all Nations into the harness of THE NEW WORLD ORDER to duplicate the China model worldwide, which means a world cultural revolution. “Left unchecked, the result will be more destruction of the global economy, greater despair and unrest, conflict, corruption, and a sense of utter hopelessness.” “They lead inexorably to deteriorating living standards and greater geopolitical unrest. Not only do they pose a threat to the future of economic growth, but they have helped to set in motion a global economic death spiral.” Thus, the world economy having been booted over the Edge of Chaos will result in all Nations, falling like over ripe fruit into communist hands. Xi will argue the cultural revolution is necessary to rid the world of all capitalistic influence represented by the “four old’s”, old culture, old customs, old habits and old beliefs. The first act will be to close the schools, so the young people can serve the Red Guard terrorist organizations that will prompt them to turn in their own teachers, principals and even their own parents to be publicly humiliated. FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER THE end of the Cold War, democracy flourished and spread across the world. On the back of glasnost, perestroika, and the fall of the Berlin Wall, democracy created nascent liberal states. This trend toward democracy was an undoubted win for liberal ideals and flew in the face of authoritarian values. It seemed to mark the end of the schisms that had divided East and West, and developing and developed countries, since World War II. History had delivered its answer to the question British prime minister Harold Macmillan posed in his seminal 1960 speech, “Wind of Change”: “As I see it, the great issue in this second half of the 20th century is whether the uncommitted peoples of Asia and Africa will swing to the East or the West. Will they be drawn into the Communist camp? Or will the great experiments in self-government that are now being made in Asia and Africa, especially in the Commonwealth, prove so successful and by their example so compelling, that the balance will come down in favor of freedom and order and justice?” Free market capitalism and liberal democracy were, it seemed, the only path toward prosperity.Yet today, for many in the emerging economies, where 85 percent of the world’s population lives, the Western insistence on political rights as a prerequisite for economic growth seems misplaced. Hundreds of millions of people in the developing world live on less than a dollar a day. For them, the choice between food and freedom is a debate between the urgent and the merely important—something difficult for many in the richer West to understand. Political freedom may be desirable but placing food on the table and a roof over heads takes precedence over all else. At its core, sequencing food ahead of freedom is about postponing, not rejecting, democratic capitalism. After all, people in poor countries do understand democracy and why it might matter, and in theory they would love to choose their leaders. But when it comes to the reality of daily life, many people worry a lot less about how the government came to power and a lot more about whether that government can provide jobs, education, and health care.The debate on whether democracy and market capitalism are prerequisites for economic growth has taken on new urgency now that people around the world see a credible alternative challenging Western economic and political ideology. Across the world, more and more citizens believe democracy and capitalism need not be the answer. Many prefer the economic and political approach of China, a model of state capitalism in which the state steers production and the economy. Democracy is de-emphasized, at least in the short term, as economic rights supersede political rights. This economic and political approach is gathering momentum and increasingly being seen by many across the developing world as the system that can deliver the greatest improvements to the human condition in the fastest period of time.Several factors place Western economic models at a disadvantage in this scenario. First, China’s model has gotten results. China has delivered record economic growth and made a significant dent in poverty. In just one generation, China has moved over three hundred million of its citizens out of poverty—that’s roughly equal to the entire population of the United States. And whereas in 1970, Chinese secondary school attendance was at 28 percent, today that figure is at 94 percent. To be sure, the country faces a multitude of challenges—from pollution, environmental concerns, and overpopulation to a corporate debt overhang that many financial-market traders worry could derail the economy. China will solve the corporate debt in one fell swoop when it informs them that there is no debt because the state owns them. This has always been true for any corporation foolish enough to think they could own anything in China. But no one can dispute that real strides have been made toward economic prosperity. By some estimates, China now ranks as the largest economy in the world in GDP terms, pumping billions of dollars of capital investment and trade into the global economy. Chinese global investment is estimated to exceed US$1.6 trillion. The United States has been estimated as representing 15.5 percent of world GDP, compared with China at 17.8 and the Eurozone at 11.8 percent. And whereas the United States has a 10.8 percent share of world exports, China has 10.7 percent, and the Eurozone 26.3 percent. Second, China has shown that it is possible to meaningfully reduce income inequality without changing its economic (or for that matter, political) system. The United States and China, as has been mentioned in previous chapters, have approximately the same Gini coefficient of 0.47, (Gini coefficient: condenses the entire distribution of income inequality for a country into a single number between 0 and 1. The greater the number the greater the inequality of income.) and unlike the United States—where income inequality has been getting worse over time—China has markedly improved. For example, the income distribution plan released by the Chinese State Council in February 2013 explicitly seeks to raise the minimum wage to at least 40 percent of average salaries. It also aims to increase spending on education and affordable housing and requires state-owned enterprises to contribute a greater share of their profits to reducing inequality. The intention of these government-led policies is to ensure that income inequality at best continues to decrease. However, some reports suggest that the results of these efforts are mixed, and progress toward reducing income inequality may have even slowed.Third, China has delivered a now-legendary infrastructure campaign. Today, China has more paved roads than the United States, having constructed an extensive network of highways in just fifteen years—even going beyond China itself. In Africa, for example, Chinese largesse has paved much of the distance from Cape Town to Cairo. With these types of achievements, it is perhaps no wonder that majorities of people across ten African countries in a 2007 Pew survey believe that the Chinese had at least a fair amount of influence over their countries, with majorities of over 90 percent holding a favorable view of China in some countries. The Heritage Foundation China Investment Tracker shows just how influential China has become—making a mark globally by increasing trade and foreign direct investment across South America, Africa, and much of the world and becoming an important lender of capital. It is investments and trading opportunities like these monitored by the China Investment Tracker that fund infrastructure, schools, and health care in partnering countries. These considerable investments and prospects for ever closer trading ties are central to why the leaders of many countries are prioritizing stronger connections with the Chinese government. In the last few years the leaders of Argentina, Brazil, India, Russia, Malaysia, and South Africa, to name a few, have all visited China and pledged to forge stronger diplomatic and trade relations. China has also been a significant lender to the US government—the largest lender in decades.Finally, China is actually following through on providing innovative solutions to age-old social challenges. For example, logistics have long posed a major stumbling block to the eradication of diseases in remote parts of the world. Travel just hours outside Mumbai, Mogadishu, or Mexico City, and you will likely find severe shortages of medicine and health care services. By leveraging the delivery expertise and network of their state-owned companies, China is helping to deliver medicines to some of the world’s most far-flung places. In the US system, the delineations among public, private, and NGO sectors are starker, and the opportunity to cross-pollinate in knowledge and expertise is much more limited. By blurring the lines between state control and private industry, the Chinese state capitalist system is legitimately able to resolve some issues that defy the American system.Under private capitalism, the bedrock of many Western economies, there is generally a clear delineation between public and private sectors. It is the blurring by tax-free NGO’s that is bringing our democracy to its knees by making promises it doesn’t intend to keep, instead, paying-off politicians to keep the truth a secret, once politicians accept the money, they have more to lose than the NGO’s if word gets out. The tax-free status of entire groups of multi-billion-dollar businesses such as Koch Industries is by far the single most impelling influence of wealth inequality, though we needn’t worry about wealth inequality directly, we must demand that tax-free status be revoked for all private organizations. Government is charged with delivering public goods such as education, infrastructure, and national security; providing regulatory oversight; and setting sound economic policies. Businesses are supposed to maximize their profits by selling whatever goods the market demands for more than the cost of production. Under state capitalism as practiced in China, by contrast, the roles of the state and commercial sectors are far more closely aligned, as the government controls much of the domestic economy through an extensive network of state-owned enterprises. In this system, the social and political goals of the government tend to take priority over strictly commercial concerns. Thus, the government can leverage the delivery expertise of a state-owned mining company—for example, by instructing it to transport and distribute medicines in distant areas.Both paradigms have their costs and benefits. While private capitalism has shown an unmatched ability to create wealth, it also tends to create extreme income inequality (This is a basic tenet of how China manipulates, much like they try to manipulate nascent democracies into being centralized, by and large, the richest people in the world are descendants of royalty, therefore among those that China has long had the strongest influence over, hence concentrating wealth in the wealthy benefits China.)  and a myopic focus on quarterly results at the expense of long-term growth. In theory, state capitalism gives companies the freedom to invest for the future rather than obsessing about immediate profits. For instance, China has shown that it is willing and able to ride out difficult economic times with trade and investment partners and retain focus on longer-term strategic goals. I’ll say, China has been focused on total world control for 3,000 years, obviously, the transition from the Qing Dynasty to the Peoples Republic and Mao’s cultural revolution appeared to be economically costly to the world but China gained unprecedented control over her population. This was something China could easily afford and deemed necessary. It also created the illusion that China was too caught-up in her own problems to be concerned with the world. Nothing could be further from the truth. Changing history while creating the illusion of disinterest are ancient Chinese secrets. They were very busy all over the world while concentrating heavily on the US and bringing their own J. Edgar Hoover to power to head a new secret agency that has orchestrated nothing short of a cultural revolution right here in the land of the free. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 initiated the clandestine gay movement in public schools while the FBI had been targeting for assassination black evangelists that were teaching that gay behavior between black men was the result of slavery. (paraphrased from a video that was difficult to hear.) Mao Zedong, like Hitler and Stalin before him, used cultural manipulation to deprive the people of their richest treasures. Uhuru Williams video – HISTORY – Mao argued the cultural revolution was necessary to rid China of all capitalistic influence represented by the “four old’s”, old culture, old customs, old habits and old beliefs. The first act was to close the schools, so the young people could serve the Red Guard terrorist organizations that prompted them to turn in their own teachers, principals and even their own parents to be publicly humiliated. One example was its ability to resist any temptation to pull out or reduce its commitments to Brazil as recession and political turmoil took hold in 2016. Among the key strategic investors in Brazil are China Three Gorges and China State Grid, a leader in electricity transmission. On the other hand, China’s large state-backed enterprises often use their privileged access to capital via state-owned banks to crowd out private competitors that might generate far more value on a level playing field. And although China’s state-based model offers useful lessons on how a symbiotic relationship between the public and private sectors can improve the delivery of social goods and services, private capitalism hardly needs to be jettisoned to achieve a higher level of public-private cooperation.Quite clearly, China has made spectacular progress when viewed within the capital-labor-productivity growth framework. In terms of capital, China has accrued an enormous amount of money (at the time of this writing the Chinese economy boasted foreign exchange reserves of over US$3 trillion—among the highest in the world); in terms of labor, China has invested in quality by focusing on education and leveraging its large population; and in terms of productivity, over the last decade China has recorded the largest increases in the world, including becoming a leader in ideas. The World Intellectual Property Organization recorded large increases in patent filings by China-based innovators in 2015. Between 1999 and 2006, China’s total factor productivity (TFP) increased by 4.4 points; between 2007 and 2012, TFP increased by 2 points. Globally during the same time periods, average TFP increased by 1.3 and 0.5 respectively. For many across the globe, China’s accomplishments translate into tangible, visible, on-the-ground improvements in people’s lives. This visible evidence of economic progress is what prompts many people around the world, and particularly in poorer, emerging countries, to believe China’s economic model can transform the arc of their lives in the shortest period of time.In light of China’s meteoric rise, people in emerging economies have grown to doubt the importance of prioritizing democracy in the quest for economic growth. In July 2014, the recently reelected prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, admitted, “the new state that we are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state. It does not reject the fundamental principles of liberalism such as freedom—and I could list a few more—but it does not make this ideology the central element of state organization, but instead includes a different, special, national approach.” Hungary is still democratic, in that Orban was elected; he has, however, rejected the “liberal” part of “liberal democracy.” Orban cited China, Russia, and Turkey—all illiberal states—as his models and pointed to the 2008 financial crisis as proof that “liberal democratic states cannot remain globally competitive.” He is not the only democratically elected leader skeptical that the free market system can deliver sustained growth and reduce poverty. If we look back further in history, we find examples of countries like Chile, Singapore, and Taiwan—not just China—that have made it abundantly clear that democracy is not a prerequisite for economic growth. In fact, overwhelming evidence shows that economic growth is a prerequisite for democracy, not the other way around.”“…Seventy percent of the world’s democracies have become so illiberal that they’re indistinguishable from authoritarian regimes, according to a 2015 Freedom House report that described global freedom as being in decline for the ninth consecutive year…” “…There are rational reasons behind doubts and skepticism toward liberal democracy and free market capitalism. Over the past decade, those living in emerging markets point to increased geopolitical uncertainty (Brexit, the election of Trump) and economic volatility (the 2008 financial crisis) as both coming from the West. (But did the geopolitical uncertainty and the 2008 financial crisis originate in the West or was it the result of manipulation of politicians by the Far East through our vast secret bureaucracy.) Moreover, structural problems such as slowing economic growth and worsening income inequality serve to highlight fundamental weaknesses with Western democracy and market capitalism that are deemed unappealing and unacceptable. Therefore, as discontent stretches across the world, middle-class citizens in countries like Pakistan and Taiwan, traditional supporters of reform, have turned against democracy. The governments in Hungary and the Czech Republic have cracked down on political freedoms. Countries like Honduras, Thailand, and Fiji have undergone military coups, while the quality of democracy has deteriorated in Russia, Kenya, Argentina, and Nigeria, among others. Prime Minister Orban of Hungary is part of a trend of a political form of recidivism, whereby citizens through democratic process are freely choosing to elect authoritarian leaders and regimes…” Really, these changes are the result of free elections and there has been no backlash by the public, protesting the lack of free and fair elections.“…Of course, the question of the ideal size of the state is an age-old debate. However, the argument of big government versus small government is somewhat of a distraction, as in practice the key issue is a government’s level of effectiveness…” This document argues that over 240 years ago the Founding Fathers were well aware of the fact that there is a direct connection between the size of government and its effectiveness. Furthermore, there is a direct connection between how centralized a government is and its efficiency in providing the needs of the people while remaining free of debt. “…In fact, according to the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), “countries with more effective governments tend to achieve higher levels of economic growth by obtaining better credit ratings and attracting more investment, offering higher quality public services and encouraging higher levels of human capital accumulation… accelerating technological innovation, and increasing the productivity of government spending.” Moreover, the MCC finds that “on average, countries with more effective governments have better educational systems and more efficient health care.” Crucially, this reflects how government’s effectiveness, and not political freedom or democracy, ultimately determines economic growth. Central to the government’s effectiveness is its discipline to resist reaching beyond its core remit. At a very basic level, government has three roles: providing public goods (such as education, national security, health care, and infrastructure), enforcing and regulating laws, and acting as financier of last resort that steps in when the markets fail (for example, in the government bailouts around the financial crisis of 2008). When government reaches beyond these roles, it is inimical to a country’s long-term economic growth.The state is expected to deliver a suite of (quality) public goods—including national security, infrastructure (such as physical roads and electricity), education, and health care. Of course, the most effective governments are able to deliver public goods in such a way that their debt burden remains sustainable. Where government takes the lead in setting out these public goods, the private sector will follow, forming the basis for job creation and economic growth. In the United States, for example, the government has jump-started private-sector investment in at least four noteworthy areas: the Manhattan Project of 1942–1946, which led to a massive wave of scientific innovation; the US interstate highway system, which created a road network crucial for commerce and communication in the country; the NASA-led Apollo landings; and the development of the Internet, which evolved from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (under the Department of Defense), responsible for the development of emerging technologies for military use.Second, government enforces the nation’s laws, regulates the economy and society, and metes out punishment when the legislature and judicial system deem it warranted. This role, inasmuch as it relates to business and the economy, has reached fever pitch in the wake of the financial crisis, with governments under pressure to support their banking systems and stave off longer-lasting recessions.Finally, government is expected to act in times of crisis. At a minimum, the state will act if a crisis is of sufficient scale to disrupt the normal workings of the economy and poses a systemic risk. No other entity (for example, the private sector) can step in to remedy the situation if markets fail to clear—that is, if buyers struggle to find people to sell to, and vice versa. Catastrophic situations, whether they take the form of disease epidemics, natural disasters, or financial crises, warrant state redress…” Trouble arises when government policy steps outside these boundaries, however. For example, the “Housing for All” policy in the United States transformed the government from merely an overseer of the financial markets into an active market participant—as an investment adviser that not only encouraged but also incentivized American households to tie their wealth into housing and real estate rather than stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and so forth. Through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government became a de facto mortgage lender, providing inexpensive mortgages that made housing investments look artificially cheap when compared to other asset classes. Worse still, this intervention ensured that many people borrowed in excess, owning property when ostensibly they should not have. This was the kernel of what would become the 2008 financial crisis leading to the Great Recession. As of 2014, Fannie Mae ($3.25 trillion of assets) and Freddie Mac ($1.9 trillion) had between them more than $5 trillion of assets—nearly 30 percent of US GDP. In short, the US government’s overreach (in financing private-sector housing) contributed to its own burgeoning debt burden as well as to the broader financial crisis.To take stock thus far, the world is heading in a direction of greater government control and intervention. China’s state-led model has a growing appeal and following across developing markets, and Western economies are themselves adopting more state interventionist tendencies. What is clear is that any shift toward an expanding role for the state in an economy poses a risk to government effectiveness and ultimately the prospects for economic growth…” “…despite its commitment to free market values, even the United States places constraints on outside investment in key sectors. Through CFIUS, which reviews and vetoes foreign investment, the United States vetoed a Chinese investment in a lighting technology company in 2016, and the Dubai Ports investment in a US ports facility was scrapped in 2006.”As developed countries are becoming more interventionist in their economies, one has to wonder if they, too, are drawing on the success of the Chinese model, or at least trying to compete with it. Whatever the case, emerging countries in particular should heed this warning: The China model has its limitations and is not necessarily replicable. In the face of an unquestionably impressive track record in China, there are several important reasons to question the viability of the Chinese model when applied to the emerging world and beyond. It is not only difficult for other countries to adopt China’s model but also undesirable. China’s model is UNDESIRABLE. China’s economic system contains significant structural inefficiencies of a kind that are baked into any system that dislocates markets. A state-centric system, in which the government is the arbiter of an economy’s factors of production, creates mispricing of assets—from goods and real estate to the key inputs necessary for long-term, sustained economic growth such as capital and labor. This can create supply and demand imbalances, in turn leading to inflation rates so high they are inimical to economic growth, development, and living standards. Inflation is less of a threat amid the current economic malaise, but at the height of China’s growth phase, and just before the financial crisis, when oil prices were close to US$140 a barrel, this was a real challenge. Moreover, such policy approaches can distort prices and interest rates, increasing the cost of doing business. This can be seen in instances when state-owned enterprises suck up capital and crowd out private-sector capital and investment. There you have it, folks, the 2008 Financial Crisis was bad for the rest of the world, but it saved China from having a financial crisis, coincidence, I think not!What is more, the Chinese model simply is not viable for many emerging markets. Driven largely by exports to markets in the West, the Chinese economy has little in common with emerging markets that primarily produce and depend on agriculture commodities. As it happens, the United States and Europe have practically prohibited importation of these precise commodities through subsidies for domestic producers. And while state-centric policies may yield artificial employment in the short term, state-centric inefficiencies create enormous dead-weight losses in the longer term that can be so deeply entrenched as to undermine economic progress and prosperity.Indeed, China itself is now grappling with massive debt problems that are plaguing the financial sector, a property bubble that market actors fear could burst at any time, and pollution that acts as a drag on GDP growth. All of these raise the possibility that a more severe economic slowdown in China could turn out to be inevitable. Whether China’s political class will overcome these challenges—whether its system of economics ever can—is still an open question.Nevertheless, as China moves past the United States to become the world’s largest economy in GDP terms—something that experts such as the IMF now predict will happen as soon as 2022—the Chinese model will only continue to gain admirers. The momentum toward state-led capitalism should prompt calm reflection on the future of democratic capitalism and, ultimately, the need for reform. US Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer’s book, Making Our Democracy Work, reminds us it took nearly 170 years from the signing of the US Constitution to establishing equal education under the law (this was enshrined in the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education). It would take another eleven years for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to guarantee universal suffrage for all United States citizens.If it took the United States over a century and a half to embed free and democratic rights for all its citizens, should China not be afforded similar consideration with respect to the evolution of its own political and economic system? How long will it take for China to give anyone the right to vote? If they do it will be meaningless unless they grant them the freewill to vote their conscience. We should perhaps find reassurance in the fact that the Chinese political and economic model is not static but rather in a constant state of flux toward improvement. Its imperfections are not reason for quickly tossing it aside.Against the backdrop of failing economic growth, leaders across the emerging world are making policy based on daily practical realities rather than ideology. In this regard, the spread of the Western model should come from its appeal, not from strong-arming developing countries into falling in line. Leaders and citizens everywhere should feel that liberal systems will help solve their immediate (economic) problems. Put another way, rather than force people to embrace liberal democracy and free market capitalism, the way to get them to adopt it is to demonstrate that it can work, create growth, and end poverty in an equitable fashion. What could be more compelling for the rest of the world than an economic system seen to create sustainable economic growth and lift people out of poverty and despair?At its best, the Western model speaks for itself. This is the approach that put food, refrigerators, and televisions in millions of homes. It has fostered and nurtured the innovative spirit that won the space race and put a man on the moon. These are the kinds of concrete, tangible results people want: what they saw, what they envied, and what they believed in. But in this generation, concrete, tangible results are what they are getting from China and are certainly no longer guaranteed from liberal democracy and market capitalism. “At its best, the Western model speaks for itself.” IN LATE 2013, KATERYNA ZHEMCHUZHNYKOVA, a twenty-five-year-old journalist leading protests in eastern Ukraine, was asked why she had taken to the streets. “I want to live in a country where the law is not just a word in the dictionary,” she explained, but in a country “where people are free to tell what they think; to do what they want; to go where they dream.” Until recently, the world has been on a path that assumed that liberal democracy and free market capitalism were the only real path to economic prosperity. The rise of China has led many to revisit these assumptions. What if Zhemchuzhnykova’s dream, a dream shared by many, is not achievable along the paths of liberal democracy and free market capitalism? After all, there are other political and economic policy routes to establishing a middle class, a precursor to a democracy, and a market economic system that lasts. As the twentieth century gives way to a world of slower economic growth, ideology takes a backseat. The world is shifting from pursuing the ideals of freedom to grappling with the reality of earning a living.International institutions such as the World Bank—purveyors of the famed Washington Consensus that argued that a suite of free market policies was the enlightened path to free markets and free peoples—are changing their tune. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, appeared to give a nod to more state-led systems when he proclaimed, “There is more than one path to shared prosperity. One path is through increased opportunities driven by greater economic growth. Another is through a stable social contract, which focuses on raising the living standards of the poor and the disadvantaged.” It has been estimated that by 2025 over 80 percent of the world’s poor people will be in fragile, mainly low-income states. This emerging backdrop underscores the urgency of getting the economic and political approach right.” “This emerging backdrop underscores the urgency of getting the economic and political approach right.” “Twenty-five years after Francis Fukuyama argued in The End of History and the Last Man that democracy and capitalism had emerged victorious over any other form of government, the picture looks quite different. In the United States, our democracy has been unable to address critical problems, including infrastructure, immigration, tax reform, education, and entitlements. Democratically elected leaders in Russia, Turkey, and elsewhere have perverted the system and become autocratic leaders determined to maintain power at all cost. The Panama Papers exposed how many democratic leaders have used the system for personal financial gain.What went wrong?Is democracy still the best form of government?Can it be salvaged, or have we reached the end of the road? There is certainly a debate to be had as to whether, in a highly globalized world with frictionless communication, the nation-state is becoming obsolete as a way of organizing government. There is a more fundamental question, however, about the behavior of those in power: namely, whether political leaders, particularly in liberal democracies, are capable of looking beyond the short term in order to create long-run economic and social progress. Chapter 6: The Perils of Political Myopia “SPEAKING BEFORE THE BRITISH HOUSE of Commons on November 12, 1936, just three years before the start of World War II, Winston Churchill lamented of the ruling government: “So they go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.” This is a perfect description of US politicians today.Churchill was speaking specifically to a pressing current issue, criticizing the Baldwin government for failing to rearm as Germany was investing heavily in its air force. But his skepticism regarding government’s ability to be efficient and even trustworthy transcends time.According to the 2017 Edelman Trust Survey, only 41 percent of a general global population trusts the government. Meanwhile a 2015 Pew Research Center survey reported that “the public’s trust in the federal government continues to be at historically low levels. Only 19 percent of Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right ‘just about always’ (3 percent) or ‘most of the time’ (16 percent).” The same study found that the share of Americans that trust the government in Washington to do the right thing nearly always or most of the time reached an all-time high of 77 percent in 1964 and has declined ever since. Together with the evidence that citizens in emerging markets see authoritarian leaders as more trustworthy than democratic politicians, it seems that people across the globe are skeptical of the ability of democratic governments to act effectively—including as good custodians of the economy.The root cause of this skepticism about democracy is also the crux of the forces that have brought us to the edge of chaos: we have embedded in both business and the democratic political system a predilection for short-termism. And as we shall see in the chapters that follow, myopia in business and especially in politics is singularly detrimental to economic success—a key drags on the prospects of long-term economic growth. It is vital that policymakers and politicians act to address it before it grows still worse. Correcting just this one problem would do much to address virtually all of the specific challenges to economic growth that we confront today…”“…Economic choices are at the core of politics…”“Economic choices are at the core of politics.”“…politicians are rewarded for pandering to voters’ immediate demands and desires, to the detriment of growth over the long term. Because democratic systems encourage short-termism in this way, we are unlikely to solve many seemingly intractable structural problems responsible for our global growth lull without an overhaul of democracy…” “…it is not only the frequency of elections that encourages short-term thinking in many liberal democracies. The poor design of the US government has left the system conducive to brinkmanship (the art or technique of pursuing a dangerous policy to the limits of safety before stopping in order to secure the greatest advantage, especially by creating diplomatic crises in politics, ""in any game of brinkmanship, it is possible that one side will collapse suddenly"". This is the situation with China, not because US politicians are purposely pushing China to the edge, China has unfathomable gold reserves for a nice fat cushion, China, is pushing the US and the world to the edge of collapse, with a great deal of help from the secret agencies within each country. Ms. Moyo is referring to the stopgap system; “Many lawmakers from both parties agree that the way the government funds its operations is broken and does not allow agencies to plan or prioritize. But the stopgap system has remained in place because lawmakers have a hard time agreeing on spending levels for different programs…”) where budgetary matters are concerned. In 2013, for example, the United States suffered a prolonged crisis when it reached a debt ceiling of $16.4 trillion, which had been set by the federal Budget Control Act in 2011. This created a political logjam (one that remains unresolved and continues to occur) in which the government had to take emergency measures, including acquiring approvals from Congress to allow it to continue to borrow in order to continue to function, culminating in a two-week government shutdown. More generally, the annual budgeting and appropriations process in the United States allows political differences in the short term to hamper important decisions that are key to long-term economic success.” “The poor design of the US government - This is a very broad statement that Ms. Moyo makes and then narrows it down to budgetary matters, my argument is that the design of the US government remains the finest example of democracy that exists on the earth, the problem is in the financial system put in place by Alexander Hamilton. - has left the system conducive to brinkmanship where budgetary matters are concerned.” To quote Thomas Jefferson again from the preface to The Anas “Hamilton’s financial system had two objectives. 1st as a puzzle to exclude popular understanding & enquiry. 2nd as a machine for the corruption of the legislature…” This is the crux of the US government problem and it can be solved by simplifying the tax code. The first half of the paper I touted the first year of the two years I’ve been at this, takes this problem on directly and demonstrates how a uniform tax code for business on the state and federal level facilitates a very reasonable 100% maximum across the board markup on a company’s product line. The second year it grew seemingly with a will of its own on the flood of new information coming in as a result of owning this computer, but I pushed it away, disconnected for a short time and came back to discover these two timely books; “HURRAH, HURRAH! Praise God!” To quote my dearly departed mother when she was informed that her cancer was in remission. “The crucial point is this: political short-termism makes the economic headwinds we face worse, and it makes the challenges we confront harder to solve. Some of this is due to bad policies implemented for short-term gain. But in many cases policymakers today are guilty of policy omission rather than commission, in that they have opted to do nothing. They choose not to implement good but complex policies (such as a more robust form of globalization), instead preferring half measures or inaction that is less politically risky. For example, doing something about changing demographics, new technologies of automation, and declining productivity has long been on policymakers’ agenda. The fact that these challenges remain largely unaddressed even to this day reflects a lack of action for decades. Debt is another prime example. Politicians can be easily persuaded to load up on sovereign debt with little consideration of long-term repayment, especially since borrowing more today enables them to fund policies that might win votes. Reducing debt, on the other hand, may require them to make unpopular cuts to services, placing their reelection at risk. Thus, debt goes up but rarely down. In a similar vein, tackling demographic headwinds by raising the retirement age is a decision that, in hindsight, ought to have been made decades ago to help escape the pension crisis. After all, since the 1990s, economists have been warning of unsustainable pension deficits resulting from a shrinking working population and people living longer. But because this would be unpalatable to retirees, who vote in large numbers, the decision has been deferred.”“(such as a more robust form of globalization)” The problem with continuing to push toward greater economic globalization under the present circumstances is that it is tantamount to turning over the global authority to China, which, as you noted, is undesirable. We here in the US must first put our own house in order before it will be advantageous to us or the rest of the world to promote “a more robust form of globalization”. There is also the matter of facing the fact that, always more globalization is not always the answer just like always more freedom is not. When you take away the rule of law it can be deadly to the young, the old and the weak. Globalization, when you take away all regulation, monopolies are the result which causes inflation levels that makes us slaves. Much of the regulation that the Trump administration has rolled back was needed. When it takes 17 years and millions of dollars in environmental studies before you can even begin an infrastructure improving project, the regulations have become a problem. But when the Pence administration roles back regulations on utilities then you know the republican establishment is clearing the way for monopolies in the home maintenance industry to further strip the middle class down to the poor and the homeless. Mon Power is now selling insurance policies at about $3.00/month to make any repairs inside people’s homes for free or for no additional cost. No small electrical repair business can compete with that. Only the largest home maintenance corporations could give them any fight but in the end the utility would win because they can literally afford to do the work for free if that’s what it takes to drive the competition out of business. So, they can do what monopolies do, demand any price they want. There is a place for protectionism alongside globalism that can strike the perfect balance. I’d prefer saving the details of what I would propose as an ideal economic balancing act between the two because it ties in closely with another aspect I wish to save for later. That is my answer to; what will people do when robots are doing virtually all of the manufacturing with great precision and efficiency? The broad answer is, enjoying life to the fullest while expanding their minds and following the growing library of deep sea and space exploration discoveries. I have ideas for combining old methods with new technology that will make those with no paying job and little money to worry about comfortably capable of earning more money than they need at their leisure.“…In the United States, firms with fewer than 500 workers employed 48.5 percent of private-sector payrolls. Small firms have accounted for 63 percent of the net new jobs created in the last twenty years…” “Moreover, since the recession, small firms accounted for 60 percent of the net new jobs, with firms with fewer than 500 employees leading job creation…” “…The allocation of capital across portfolios around the world, but particularly in developed countries, is undergoing significant transformations that have implications for economic growth. There is notable evidence that global stock markets, including in the United States, are shrinking. According to Bloomberg, in 2015 the number of listed tradable stocks on US bourses was down almost by half, from a peak of 7,322 to 3,700. Inasmuch as the stock markets represent a path for businesses to fund investment and job creation, this “de-equitization” trend is worrisome and could destabilize global debt and equity capital markets…”“Today, short-termism has spread beyond the halls of government into the power centers of finance and business. Here, too, it is a drag on economic growth. The tenure of CEOs is growing ever shorter, from an average of 10 years in 1990 to 6.6 years in 2011 to 4.4 years now. Meanwhile, according to Yale executive-in-residence Richard Foster, the average lifespan of an S&P 500 company in 1935 was 60 years; in 2011, it was 18 years. And while the average length of time a stock in the New York Stock Exchange is held in a portfolio was 5 years and 3 months in 1970, in 2011 it was just 7 months. The Financial Times reports that researchers at Stanford University have found that “pressure to meet quarterly earnings targets may be reducing research and development spending and cutting U.S. growth by 0.1 percentage points a year.” On the other hand, private companies have been found to invest at nearly 2.5 times the rate of comparable public companies, perhaps reflecting the fact that they fear failing to meet the short-term demands of shareholders. By persistently investing at a lower rate, America’s largest companies may be cutting 0.2 percentage points from US growth yearly. As the investment horizon grows shorter, businesses are less likely to invest in infrastructure and other longer-term propositions. CEO compensation is symptomatic of a cultural shift toward short-term thinking. According to the same report, “74 percent of remuneration is paid in cash, and tied to outperforming an annual stock market benchmark.” There is growing concern that managers today are incentivized to focus on short-term results, such as the next quarter, rather than the next five to ten years, thereby shifting and shortening the investment horizon. In response, there has been considerable effort by corporations to better match senior executive compensation with longer-term company performance…” “…Companies are choosing to scale back rather than grow, and to return money to shareholders instead of making capital investments, such as building new factories or increasing R&D, to lay foundations for future growth. These are troubling signs of growing risk aversion…”“…from a company financing perspective, companies are incentivized to buy back stock—the relatively expensive equity financing—and replace it with cheaper financing in the form of debt. It is not just stock buybacks but also increasing dividend payments that suggest a company’s management does not see positive-value projects worth investing in (as opposed to negative-value projects that lose money). In a world characterized by greater uncertainty (low global growth prospects, ever changing regulation and tax environment, no discernible goods inflation), rather than reinvesting free cash flows into the business or having cash sit in the bank earning low interest rates, business managers are returning capital to their shareholders. Essentially, every dollar used to either buy back company stock or pay out dividends is a dollar not used by the company to invest in long-term projects that could stimulate growth in the economy…”“…In the US context, the class of aging investors who are no longer investing for the long term hold the lion’s share of savings. Although rational, their decision to collect dividends and safe, small returns could have significant deleterious consequences for the appetite for equities and thus constrain the ability of companies to invest and grow.The trends of less money chasing the equity markets and more money chasing bonds have at least two effects. First, they hurt productivity, which is propelled by innovation and equity risk investments. This is particularly worrisome at a time when global productivity continues to stall. Second, these trends may not be all bad, in that they do present opportunities and more attractive returns for growth investors who are willing to tolerate a longer investment horizon. At the highest level, investors—so crucial to driving capital into infrastructure, innovation, and businesses that drive economic growth—are choosing income today over longer-term investment, to the detriment of growth tomorrow. Short-termism is built into the structure of both governments in liberal democracies and the private sector, with ill effects for long-term economic growth…”“…Infrastructure remains woefully inadequate in the United States. Any modern economy needs, as its foundation, a solid infrastructure base: ports, roads, electricity, airports, telecommunications, and railways. While this might appear self-evident, the state of infrastructure in the United States suggests otherwise. A 2017 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave the country a grade of D+ for overall infrastructure, citing 2,170 high-hazard dams, 56,007 structurally deficient bridges (9.1 percent of the nation’s total), and $1 trillion in needed upgrades to drinking water systems over the next twenty-five years. The report card highlighted the urgent need for substantial funds earmarked for new infrastructure projects and maintenance of existing infrastructure. At a minimum the ASCE suggests that a $2 trillion investment is needed by 2020 to address the significant backlog of overdue maintenance and the pressing need for modernization. Without this much-needed investment, the US economy will certainly see a further erosion in growth…”“…The effects of increased infrastructure investment on the prospects of low-skilled labor could also be substantial. With the US unemployment and labor participation rates still of concern, and underemployment over 10 percent (and close to 12.6 percent for recent college graduates), a public commitment to a sizable infrastructure program could meaningfully transform the prospects of the American worker…” There is a great deal of infrastructure work to be done and we have that labor force. There are also millions of high-tech jobs that need to be filled that a combination of micromanagement of education by the federal government resulting in du stupid “New Math” and allowing the field of psychology to declare that all millennials require drug treatment and counselling has made the need for immigration to fill them an absolute must. There is also a great deal of work to be done constructing the robots to reenter manufacturing embracing technology to the fullest extent, so we can compete in the world market. Properly maintaining existing roads is all that is needed. There are thousands of structurally sound vacant buildings that should be made use of, mainly because the idle workforce is close by.“…In the United States, for example, the federal government drove the rollout of the Work Projects Administration (WPA). Launched under President Roosevelt’s New Deal to help address America’s chronic unemployment, the WPA was created in 1933 (as the Works Progress Administration, and renamed in 1939), and was America’s largest and most ambitious project dedicated to constructing public buildings, roads, bridges, schools, and courthouses. It was possible because short-term political incentives aligned with a long-term agenda of building and expanding infrastructure. Ironically, one of the most successful infrastructure programs in history was fueled by a desire to secure a shorter-term political goal of reducing unemployment. The key rationale for the politicians that set up the WPA was the creation of jobs. The enduring contribution to the nation’s infrastructure was simply a by-product of this policy approach, and the WPA was shut down in 1943, when there was a worker shortage in the economy. At that point workers were able to secure jobs mainly in war-related industries.Nevertheless, despite the complex histories of programs like the WPA, there is a fundamental question that must be addressed: What has occurred to make endemic short-termism a greater problem in liberal democracy today? (China’s influence through secret agencies). After all, liberal democracy has not itself changed radically from times of more robust economic growth in the past. Yet there are good reasons why America’s democratic politicians—even as late as the 1950s and 1960s—were able to implement large infrastructure projects without engaging in the extensive overhaul of the democratic process that this book will propose. Since then, three significant shifts have occurred that have changed the way in which Western democracies function: first, changes in economic ideology from largely state-centric to a more laissez-faire capitalism; second, the rise of the twenty-four-hour news cycle as well as the advent of social media; and third, a power shift away from the state and toward nonstate actors such as corporations and wealthy philanthropists that are increasingly taking on the role of government (including underwriting public goods), weakening the state in the process. These shifts are closely linked to the broader problem of why democratic governments of today have become less effective at delivering sustained, long-term growth.First, there has been a fundamental shift from the government interventionism that prevailed as late as the 1950s and 1960s to a more private-sector-centered, smaller-government ideology that became dominant beginning in the early 1980s. Policymakers prior to the 1980s were guided by Keynesian economic thinking. In the wake of the Great Depression and World War II, it was understood that government’s actions powered the economy through the creation of jobs and the allocation of capital. This changed in the 1980s with a shift toward greater free enterprise, a more dominant role for the private sector in driving growth, and a diminishing interventionist role for government. Private-sector investment in infrastructure replaced the grand postwar infrastructure programs that were driven by governments. However, momentum in infrastructure investment appears to have been lost as the private sector, seeking profits, replaced the public sector in leading the initiative. The ensuing slowdown in infrastructure investment underscores the view that a successful infrastructure build-out requires leadership from a long-term-oriented government.A second change since the mid-twentieth century is the growth of media, including the development of the twenty-four-hour news cycle and the emergence of social media. These have intensified short-termism in both the public and private sectors. Politicians find themselves subject to constant short-term media scrutiny and lured into a perpetual cycle of news and commentary at the expense of a focus on long-term policymaking. For business and political leaders alike, this constant media attention has led to decisions that emphasize the next quarter over the future in a way that was not previously the case.Finally, the rise in the wealth and influence of private-sector corporations and wealthy individuals has undermined the state. By minimizing their tax obligations, nonstate actors (for example, charitable foundations that receive tax breaks) diminish government tax revenues. (I’ll just take this opportunity to bust Jason Chaffetz Republican chops for wanting all other bureaucratic secrets exposed while failing to see how important it is for the American people to know when highly profitable operations, such as the multibillion-dollar businesses of the Koch Industries, are getting off scot-free on taxes. Complete transparency should have been a prerequisite for tax-free status along with total disclosure of the percent of profits spent on governmental good works and documentation of the results. Instead we get only think tanks that like aquariums full of dead fish, all they do is smell bad. NGO’s are finished, they had their chance to prove themselves capable and willing to do good things for democracy and they have failed miserably. They’re done.) Moreover, by assuming many aspects of the roles traditionally ascribed to governments—such as the provision of public goods (education, health care, and so on)—nonstate actors have run roughshod over traditional public policy agendas, answerable to no one and able to change their areas of interest and focus at a whim with little to no recourse. Essentially the charitable foundations take the reins from government in the delivery of public services but are unaccountable for whether and how they actually deliver them. In this regard, the government cedes some power in long-term agenda setting in the delivery of public goods…” The demands that I put forth in the simplified tax code calls for the end of tax-exempt status for so-called nonprofit organizations and so-called charitable organizations because when the truth comes out it will reveal that non-profits are actually among the most profitable of organizations while the charities are extremely high interest drawing tax havens for the superrich who can make withdrawals as well as deposits while the middle and upper middle class who make donations to them get only a tax write off on their donation. When counties claim sovereignty over personal income tax and state and federal government can tax only businesses plus wealthy counties and states respectively, my long-term plan is for the private sector to be locked out of public works on the state and federal level and for counties to be in control of the tax status of religious organizations and all aid organizations working in their county based entirely on whether they freely provide the county with their financial records detailing the donations that come from within the county and verify a minimum of 10% aid investment inside the county. The hope is that with the freedom to provide the aid they choose that they will choose to do more than 15% in county services. If they are not forthcoming with their records, they will be required to pay 15% income tax on donations from within the county and required share their records. There will be no tax break for donations, you pay only 15% income tax, if you want to donate some of your net-income that’s your business. Getting back to my long-term plan for infrastructure and work projects on the county, state and federal levels. Counties will replace small dams and bridges below a set cost and maintain all non-interstate roads. Counties will provide subways, elevated trains and other forms of mass transit within the county where there is a need that is not profitable to private companies. Counties will be responsible for county wide work projects aimed at ridding the county of unsightly trash along roads, rivers and streams and on public property and on private property if the owners request clean up and cannot afford to pay for private services. Counties will work toward eradicating non-native plant life, such as, kudzu and multi-floral rose bushes. These crews will first take a month bagging GPS located samples of dirt to be tested for toxicity so areas requiring cleanup can be properly taken care of. Work projects will be at the discretion of each county based on their finances. This will also be an option for the state when assisting a poor county from the state’s county aid account that is paid into by the 15% tax paid to the state by counties with an annual surplus in excess of $1,150,000.00. This same account will be used by the state for infrastructure projects such as interstate highway maintenance, highspeed underground trains connecting counties within the state, midsized dams and bridges falling between preset costs and ridding the environment of toxic waste not covered by the federal superfund etc. The federal government will use the account paid into by states with an annual surplus in excess of $1,150,000.00 first to pay off the national debt, then for major infrastructure projects such as replacing old dams and bridges that exceed a set cost. County, state and federal government will work together with property owners that have unused structures to identify sound existing buildings that can be used to house high-tech manufacturing plants and working with the owners to tear down the rest. The first choice for the location for building a new structure to house a high-tech, totally robotic manufacturing plant should be on a site where a building has been demolished rather than breaking new ground. County, state and federal government will work with all who are interested in high-tech robotic equipment from a man (or woman) who wants a CNC lathe and 3-D printer in the garage or basement to international corporations headquartered in the US that no longer manufacture here. Milwaukee power tools for example and all others that let out manufacturing to China would be wise to recognize the truth now, you own nothing in China, reopen shuttered plants stateside, you will get whatever help you need from the county, state and federal governments to manufacture products here. What you will not get is a tax exemption, you will pay 15% to either the state or federal government. And you will not get away with gouging consumers, if you can manufacture a Milwaukee angle drill for $14.00 dollars after allowed deductions, you will sell it for no more than $28.00 unless you also manufacture drill bits that you only markup 10%, then you have a lot of room to charge more for the drill.“TO BE CERTAIN, THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS of democratic capitalism are unmistakable. It has proven itself, historically, to be a peerless tool for growth…”“Interest group lobbying is another feature of liberal democracy that tends to interfere with proper allocation of assets. In 2016, more than $3.15 billion was spent lobbying Congress, roughly double the amount spent in 2000. Across sectors, lobbying by special interest groups has a discernible impact on public policy decisions in ways that negatively affect trade, infrastructure, and ultimately economic growth. For example, environmental groups oppose pipelines and new exploration projects of the oil industry, agricultural interests lobby for farm subsidies, and American trucking interest groups oppose additional tolls earmarked for road maintenance. (This is one possible reason US infrastructure is graded a D+.) We demand an end to all lobbying of Congress by special interest groups, corporations, billionaires and all others that would pay to have their way by corrupting Congress. Petition: Yes. Lobby: No. Congress will be stronger in the world when it has been freed from micromanaging the country. And Stronger still, by restoring the reputation of the US as a world leader dedicated to fostering nascent democracies around the world, nurturing at the county level by helping them elect their county commissioners and letting the people develop the state and federal levels. County commissioners will act as their representatives on the state and federal levels until those levels are defined and activated. Our main objective must be to discover how people are trying to make a living and making the most practical technology available to them that will make their job easier and more efficient. Our job will be to protect their economy to “lift all boats”, small & large by making high-tech accessible or low-tech or new-tech invented to assist them in doing things using  the resources and power sources at hand. Not to flood their country with apples when they grow apples themselves. If globalists won’t learn something from this: “In December 2010, a poor Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi lit himself on fire to protest the arbitrary expropriation of his goods and his economic future. Within weeks Bouazizi’s act of self-immolation precipitated the Arab Spring revolutions, as under the slogan of “Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam” (“People demand removal of the regime”) protests spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunisia to Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Sudan, and Yemen. Today, that region is in the midst of what some are likening to a modern Thirty Years War.” This will be globalism’s fatal flaw. Democracy means protecting an individual’s right not to be exploited or stepped on by big business. It is a dangerous game to allow the Dragon to roam across the countries dressed like a lamb, but this is what we must do. Patiently plan long-term economic growth for the ten least livable cities in the world and Africa and get it right for the people. Educating the public about the deceptive ways and ultimate goals of the beast is the key. The pretense of the pseudo lamb must be countered, punch for punch. Doing the right thing, following through on all commitments made. This is why we must give the Palestinians every inch of real estate they were promised. Mankind has prostrated itself precariously close to the Edge of Chaos.  We must step back from the edge. Disconnect for a while. Use third eye technology that only records audio and video and stores it on a smart phone that can live stream to the constituents of elected officials. Insist that elected officials take this first vital step toward regaining their freewill, the ability to think and act on their own. Use the audio and video to study your encounters with other human beings, to analyze whether they are using programming to control you. We need this technology mass produced and made available at the lowest possible price. Big Tech is obviously compromised when they practice censorship, so we must find individuals or small operations that can take micro body cams to the next level. This is the preparation needed to take the first step and the most important step. Our first demand is that all elected officials begin wearing third eye technology 24/7 for their own protection and the opportunity to regain their freewill. You will quickly recover your freewill because everyone requires a steady diet of being controlled to remain at their command. When you are able to discover who is controlling you, you will be awestruck to discover that you are the one controlling them. Most often a married couple have been programmed to trade roles back and forth keeping each other under. “The need to win reelection also impedes the effective allocation of resources by elected officials. Political cycles too often keep politicians beholden to the individuals and corporate interests that help fund their campaigns and to the vagaries of public opinion polling. Little wonder that there are questions about the correlation, and even causality, between liberal democracy and the incentive for people to be productive. In essence, in order to win competitive democratic elections politicians must offer more benefits to voters, such as generous pensions or tax breaks. The electorate becomes conditioned to demand more of the state over time (knowing that they can extract benefits from politicians) and can themselves become less incentivized to be productive.Another crucial shortcoming of democratic capitalism, despite its vaunted successes, is that in its purer forms it can foster corruption. The scandals of the early 2000s of established, blue-chip US companies such as Enron and WorldCom as well as Italy’s Parmalat, along with the global accounting scandals of Arthur Andersen and top-tier investment banks uncovered during subsequent bankruptcy and investigations, proved that the capitalist system was not immune from systematic wrongdoing.” Which is why regulations will always have their place in improving economic growth. Wise, minimal in number, clear in meaning, designed with a singular goal: Fair play for all, for all, a level playing field. This is not so simple because massive multi-national corporations dominate the international playing field. This is why protectionism will always have its place. Nascent democracies don’t start at the top and neither do businesses. Sometimes leveling the playing is not possible. A little league team cannot suit up against a professional football team. There is no way to make that a fair game. The simple answer is they don’t play on the same field. We should not have to worry at all about big business, they have scaled the mountain and are enjoying the view from the top. Small countries, small markets and small businesses need protection because it is not possible to have entirely separate playing fields where economics is concerned. You have written a lot about the availability of capital and when you have unlimited funds you can get labor and be productive. A real problem for small business is the availability of capital. The biggest problem for a small business that has a great product, but has trouble keeping up with demand is that even though the cash is flowing in, it is rarely the amount of money needed to expand enough to keep up with demand. This is a great problem to have, but when you need to build a new facility, hire labor or purchase robots or both to increase production, it can easily be a lot more than a bank will loan you. It seems that most people who find themselves in this position, no matter how many times they’ve been warned about the pitfalls of accepting capital from the sharks, it happens again and again. These people simply aren’t as experienced as the sharks. Philanthropists could be a great thing for small business if there weren’t so many sharks. Billionaires say everything the small business owner wants to hear, and they fall for it, over and over again. This is the reason that so much is made of the fact that most of the small businesses are owned by the superrich, its true of course, but how did the superrich come into possession of most of the small businesses? Nobody wants to talk about that, but they didn’t start hardly any of them themselves. The problem is that Philanthropists tell these small business owners they’ll supply them with cash and stay out of the way, they tell them all they want to do is help them to succeed. While, the whole time their lawyers and accountants are keeping meticulous notes and gaining greater knowledge of the true potential value of the small business. When the time is right, they pump the cash in, the business expands, things couldn’t be better for the owner until one day the small business owner comes to work and the Philanthropist is in his office sitting behind his desk with a “generous” no-compete contract for him to sign. The small business owner says, are you crazy, I’m not signing that. The Philanthropist tells them they really don’t have any choice because they own the company already, and they tell them they can sign the contract and take the money, or you can leave with nothing to show for all your hard work. You can be sure that they take what they can get without signing the no-compete portion of the sales contract and get out if they’re smart, if they’re not they accept a position working for the new owner. There is a simple solution to this, but the billionaires will say it’s not fair to them, so like most simple solutions, the difficult part is getting the regulation and establishing it as the law of the land.Laws already acknowledge that valuation of any business is much more than the cost of the building it is in. Even a business that has not gone public is much more than brick and mortar. The law will further acknowledge that the valuation of any business is at best, a calculated guess. The simple solution and one of our demands are that: The law will assume that the Philanthropist is experienced in evaluating the true potential value of a business and no matter how much money a Philanthropist invests in a small business it will be assumed that they are smart enough not to invest more than ten percent of their estimate of its true value. Therefore, the law will rely on these assumptions to say the benchmark for the valuation of a business in this specific situation is always at least ten times the amount invested by the largest investor. This separates the professional players from the little league teams in the right way. By doing a job that most laws or regulations have a very difficult time accomplishing. That is, making an honest investor out of a shark, after all, by definition a philanthropist is a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money. This makes a philanthropist live up to the definition of their practice by making it impossible for the above scenario to happen again because no matter how meticulous the notes of the lawyers and accountants working for the Philanthropist and no matter how much money the promoter of good will pumps into the business the Philanthropist cannot claim to own more than ten percent of the business. “Another problem associated with democratic capitalism is that it does not insure an economy against inequality. To the contrary, in fact: the rich in countries such as the United States (who make large contributions to political campaigns) are gaining more wealth, income, and political influence, thereby widening the gap between them and the rest of society. Because democratic politics rests on political contributions, it widens the inequality between rich and poor. It is the use of wealth to influence political outcomes that helps inequality take root. Until democracies push back on the use of wealth to influence elections and policies, initiatives by governments to address inequality will be blunted. This could explain why both left-leaning and right-leaning democratic governments have failed to counter the persistent widening of income inequality over the past several decades.Finally, democracy is prone to party duopolies and gridlock. Democratic systems are supposed to encourage competitive elections, but for the most part we see advanced democracies locked into rigidly dogmatic political ideologies. Rather than feature a free-ranging competition that surfaces the best ideas, democratic elections often produce a stale collision between two rigid sets of beliefs. Many Western democracies are little more than duopolies, where two key parties dominate politics, with the United States being a prime example. No third party has come close to challenging the dominance of the Republicans and Democrats. Yet the 2017 French election of Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche movement proves that a long-standing and established political duopoly is vulnerable to challenge from a new third party, depending on local circumstances.Even so, a democratic political process can lead to one-party dominance. The case of Japan is especially instructive. Despite a strong democratic system, it has seen the same party elected and reelected to power for over six decades. The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) is a conservative political party, continuously in power since its 1955 creation, with the exception of two brief periods, the first less than a year, the second from 2009 to 2012. In a similar vein, since South Africa’s first free and fair elections in 1994, the country has been ruled by the same party, the African National Congress.In some ways, the electoral process itself occludes deeper flaws in democracy. Voters take comfort in their ability to remove individual politicians when they err, yet this possibility leaves underlying structures largely free from critique, improvement, and enhancement. If anything, we are evangelists for democracy, happy to export it to other countries, content that rotating politicians via the electoral process is enough to sidestep any weaknesses democracy might harbor. Poor economic performance, in this view, can be directly traced to bad policy decisions by individual politicians, leaving aside the question of whether the systems need to evolve. Yet as we saw in the previous chapter, for all their flaws alternate political systems can nevertheless generate meaningful improvements in economic growth and living standards—sometimes precisely because they are unlike mature, liberal democracies. In a world where growth is flagging, it is therefore all the more important for us to acknowledge the weaknesses in the political and economic systems of mature, liberal democracies.”It could be argued that one of democracy’s greatest weaknesses is the ability to reform itself. Sadly, this is true, despite the fact that the US government was designed with the specific purpose of being able to change with the times and despite the fact that it showed this to be true for the first 200 years, something very significant changed in eighties, as you have mentioned. I believe your economic research into the history of how different countries have fared gives us significant insight into the singular reason things have changed so much since the eighties. Undoubtedly, the most significant change of all, which you have also noted is the increase in corruption throughout the system from top to bottom. “Trance Formation of America” by Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips tells the story of the MK Ultra program run by the CIA that started in the early sixties. Despite the fact that the CIA had only just begun to study mind control they became so proficient at it that it has rapidly spread across the country. This suggests that the Chinese with thousands of years of experience with mind control programmed the CIA to do the job. Your research proves that China has used the tools it bragged about to the world through its Soviet era mouthpiece to corrupt our government from within and dominate the world economy. Democracy is ready to drop like overripe fruit into their hands. Are the people already too scared to sign my petition in massive numbers? Will fear prevent them from having the courage to stand around barrels of fire in county court yards across the country 24/7 roasting corn and drinking bottled water until the US government accepts our demands? Or will you wait until you have to fight, spilling blood all over this land. Judging by the violence in the schools last year peaceful protests in county court yards may prove to be the safer place to be. “If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may be even a worse fate, you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.”             – Winston Churchill – “It could be argued that one of democracy’s greatest weaknesses is the ability to reform itself. Reform of democracy must, however, be at the heart of a successful plan to improve economic growth and global prosperity.So far, this chapter has detailed how the democratic system inherently contains incentives for policymakers to implement bad policy choices that undermine long-term economic success. Nevertheless, as we seek solutions to remedy democracy’s failings, we should acknowledge that politicians in a liberal democracy need not be malicious or even inept to fall prey to short-term thinking. They are wholly rational actors—responding to voters, succumbing to media pressure, and battling to stay in office, even if it means they do so at the expense of the economy’s longer-term success.When democracy works, it delivers economic growth and fundamental freedoms in a way that no other system can. And when it fails, it is rarely, if ever, replaced by a system that can do a better job of delivering for its population. Therefore, creating growth requires that we preserve democratic capitalism’s core strengths—freedom, efficient markets, transparency, and correctly constructed incentives—and reform its weaknesses. Something must be done to remedy the political class’s severe case of myopia, correcting the mismatch between long-term economic challenges and election cycles, safeguarding independent economic choices from political pressures, and eliminating dysfunction and gridlock.” “IN HIS COMMENCEMENT REMARKS AT Virginia’s Hampden-Sydney College in 2013, Admiral Eric Olson spoke of how Navy SEAL training has historically graduated only about 20 percent of the physically fit and highly motivated young men who begin the course. A study of the 80 percent who didn’t complete training discovered that most of those who quit did so during breakfast or lunch. This “quitting” cohort (who quit in anticipation rather than in the midst of some activity itself) was afraid that the next thing they would be required to do would be too difficult, too cold, too wet, too painful, or too tiring. They quit because they feared that they would fail.The study also explored factors that contributed to the success of the 20 percent who would actually become Navy SEALs. The research considered age, experience, geographic origin, interests, intelligence, fitness levels, and more. But perhaps more interesting was what the study revealed in the category of “sports and hobbies.” The third best indicator of success in SEAL training was being on a water polo team at the high school or collegiate level, and the second best was being on the wrestling team, but the top indicator was a high level of expertise in chess. It is understandable that grueling and physically demanding sports such as water polo and wrestling would figure on the list, but both were outranked by chess.Chess players are strategic thinkers who see beyond the next move or the next challenge. They were the ones who succeeded in the long, demanding, grueling Navy SEAL program. The winning cohort were not focused on what would happen after breakfast or lunch; they were mentally focused on the days or weeks ahead, already assessing how to be in the best position to overcome a future challenge. Myopia was the challenge for aspiring Navy SEALs, and myopia is the challenge for economic growth as well.”“Assessing how to be in the best position to overcome a future challenge”. Not to make these words my words, but to make them with passion.“THE REASON TO REFORM DEMOCRACY is to make government more effective and make the state better equipped to address the economic headwinds undermining the global economy. This chapter has detailed how both the democratic political approach and the market capitalist system are beset by short-term thinking, which infects decision making and destroys the prospects for strong, long-term economic growth. The solution to this myopic frame must be for democratic policymakers to better match their approach to long-term economic challenges with political cycles. Crucially, this will first and foremost require the reform of the political system over and above the reform of the market capitalist system, as we must primarily ensure that the state and political leaders are incentivized to set policies for the long term and are dissuaded from myopic thinking.Eradicating political myopia is necessary, but it is merely a first step. To resolve the growth quandary and combat the fierce headwinds we face today, even more radical reforms will be necessary. Only by fully overhauling and strengthening liberal democracy can we overcome and solve the inherent limitations of capitalism. The next chapter will offer specific proposals that seek to achieve this goal.Some may be tempted to imagine that these political reforms must be accompanied by a thoroughgoing reimagining of capitalism itself. After all, the surest sign that this system has reached the edge of chaos is the indecision and intellectual exhaustion evident in the leading economists and financial analysts of our time.The economics profession is frustrated. As the global economy struggles to emerge from the worst financial crisis in over half a century, and citizens reckon with the prospect of a prolonged period of anemic growth and deteriorating standards, the economic orthodoxy of multiple centuries is increasingly viewed with suspicion and derision. Economists failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis and have overseen an unexpectedly slow recovery in which inflation remains low and debt still increases. What went wrong?”“What went wrong?”“Esteemed economists are perplexed, filling professional journals and op-ed pages with attempts to explain the error. One thing is for sure: the canonical models of economics appear increasingly inadequate to the challenge of speeding up economic growth. The toolkit of monetary and fiscal policy that repaired the economic booms and busts of yesteryear seems abruptly impotent. This is partly due to the underlying structural changes in the global economy. Pluses are quickly offset by minuses in the zero-sum game of globalization, which leaves economies everywhere much worse off. Increased trade on the one hand is countered by wider income inequality on the other; increased capital flows beget inflation and debt burdens that drag growth lower.Complicating matters further are the potentially harmful effects on economic growth emanating from the structural transformations occurring across the global economy: technology advances, demographic shifts, widening income inequality, natural resource scarcity, and the ever-increasing global debt overhang.That the world’s most respected economists are showing some humility is a good thing. But economies do not operate in a vacuum, and neither do markets. Governments manage economies, and politicians make the laws and policies that fuel governments. Economists have shouldered enough blame, and it is time for the political class to face their own responsibility for maintaining the health of their economies and the urgent need for reform—political reform. US politicians love celebrating how “exceptional” the American democratic system is. But that system is showing some wear and tear; major parts need to be retooled or redesigned so that the world’s political leaders are better prepared to respond to the demands and volatility of a twenty-first-century global economy. Elections matter. And that is why reform of the democratic system is absolutely necessary.Economic dogma has taken the place of political compromise, and the chasm between competing schools of thought has widened just when we should be building bridges. In light of this economic paralysis, solutions must be found in political reform.Thus far, Edge of Chaos has elaborated the story of how, in its current guise, the liberal democratic system unwittingly dampens prospects for the economic growth necessary for its continued survival. The pages that follow will seek to reframe and recast the political strictures that govern the world’s leading economies. There is enormous scope for improvements in countries guided by liberal democracy. Implicit in the reform agenda offered here is an acknowledgment that the greatest hurdles to economic revival and future success are not economic. They are political. Knocking down political hurdles will require political solutions—and courageous politicians.At stake is nothing less than economic progress.” Excuse my crudeness ma’am, but there’s a HELL of a lot more at stake than just economic progress. Democracy and freedom are at stake. We have fed the Dragon until it is fat and happy and drunk on the smell of success. We’ve taken it real close to the Edge of Chaos, the time is right, it’s not too late, but time is running out, frankly ma’am, we just don’t have time to debate this, it is time to act. Why is Iran a puppet state of China today that supports Maduro in Venezuela?1953 Iranian coup d'état From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia'Willful ignorance': Inside Trump's troubled intelligence briefings By John Walcott - Time - Sunday, February 3, 2019 In the wake of President Donald Trump’s renewed attacks on the U.S. intelligence community this week, senior intelligence briefers are breaking two years of silence to warn that the president is endangering American security with what they say is a stubborn disregard for their assessments. Citing multiple in-person episodes, these intelligence officials say Trump displays what one called “willful ignorance” when presented with analyses generated by America’s $81 billion-a-year intelligence services. The officials, who include analysts who prepare Trump’s briefs and the briefers themselves, describe futile attempts to keep his attention by using visual aids, confining some briefing points to two or three sentences, and repeating his name and title as frequently as possible. Another words, treating this grown man like a child, rather than, with mutual respect and guess what, THE MAN has no respect for you because of the way you try to treat him. This is very revealing in regard to who the children in the room are. Just as we saw in the live coverage of Ms. Nancy Pelosi, Schumer, Pence and the President, President Donald Trump is a strong-willed man with good manners toward a woman and it was Chuck Schumer that showed his willingness to be disrespectful to Ms. Pelosi in his effort to get the President to go there. Schumer was frustrated into being ever more disrespectful of a woman on live television and these unintelligent buffoons of America’s $81 billion-a-year intelligence services” are frustrated because they have such an overblown self-image that they think they deserve to be respected by everyone, automatically. It appears to me that these buffoons would prefer to have a president that is being put through his second childhood (a practice that is terribly destructive and disrespectful of elderly people), than a man that understands mutual respect and is skilled in the art of avoiding eye-contact with simple-minded programmers that wish only to be in control rather than to build a relationship of mutual respect while presenting their best analysis of the available information. The United States of America would be far better served to have all of the satellite images being generated transmitted to every college and university across the country so that young minds can learn the ways these images are currently being analyzed and create new and better ways to glean all of the information available while providing a wide variety of opinions. It would be very enlightening to have all of the images generated on Sunday, July 10, 2016, at 4:20 a.m. in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C. shared and analyzed in this way. There is a ton of information that says our intelligence community is wrong about Russia hacking the DNC emails, therefore, they were stolen. There is a reason main stream media have universally close-minded opinions on such subjects, case in point, conspiracy theories in general. Now, to try to justify their own continued existence, at a cost of $81 billion-a-year to tax payers, our intelligence services gets assistance from China to present their own conspiracy theory, as you will see here in this very article. This conspiracy theory will be widely supported by the CIA infiltrated media. Is it only a theory that the CIA has engaged in unconstitutional activities by putting operatives in media positions in large and small media outlets all across our country or is it a well-known fact that has been very carefully suppressed? For anyone still unsure about the answer to this question I believe we will soon have the answer with great certainty.What is most troubling, say these officials and others in government and on Capitol Hill who have been briefed on the episodes, are Trump’s angry reactions when he is given information that contradicts positions he has taken or beliefs he holds. Two intelligence officers even reported that they have been warned to avoid giving the President intelligence assessments that contradict stances he has taken in public. That reaction was on display this week. At a Congressional hearing on national security threats, the leaders of all the major intelligence agencies, including the Directors of National Intelligence, the CIA and the FBI contradicted Trump on issues relating to North Korea, Russia, the Islamic State, and Iran. In response, Trump said the intelligence chiefs were “passive and naïve” and suggested they “should go back to school.”The intelligence officials criticizing Trump requested anonymity because the briefings they described, including the President’s Daily Brief, or PDB, are classified. The PDB is one of the most highly restricted products produced by U.S. intelligence analysts. A select group of intelligence officials is involved in preparing these briefings. A small number of senior officials, often including the Director of Central Intelligence, Director of National Intelligence or the heads of other agencies depending on the topic, usually deliver it. The reporting for this story is based on interviews with multiple officials who have first-hand knowledge of the episodes they describe, and multiple others who have been briefed on them. Asked in detail about the officials’ concerns, senior White House and National Security Council officials declined to comment.The problem has existed since the beginning of Trump’s presidency, the intelligence officials say, and for a time they tried to respond to the President’s behavior in briefings with dark humor. After a briefing in preparation for a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, for example, the subject turned to the British Indian Ocean Territory of Diego Garcia. The island is home to an important airbase and a U.S. Naval Support Facility that are central to America’s ability to project power in the region, including in the war in Afghanistan. The President, officials familiar with the briefing said, asked two questions: Are the people nice, and are the beaches good? “Some of us wondered if he was thinking about our alliance with the Brits and the security issues in an important area where the Chinese have been increasingly active, or whether he was thinking like a real estate developer,” one of the officials said wryly.My analysis is that Mr. President, Donald Trump exceeds all my expectations in the skills this man displays in avoiding being duped by experts in the field of programming, or “not”. They believe they are the ones who have been duly elected by the people of the United States of America, but they are nothing. They are unconstitutional interlopers and the people of the USA must organize in conjunction with their county commissions to “Occupy County Courtyards” Wednesday morning to signal to our duly elected President that he has our full support and to insure that the two Parties and the media are not able to subvert the efforts of the President of the United States of America as he takes on the ginormous task  of ending secrecy and inefficiency in government of any kind by firing all 2.2 million federal employees and granting county government complete sovereignty over the people of county into a coup that culminates in impeachment.In another briefing on South Asia, Trump’s advisers brought a map of the region from Afghanistan to Bangladesh, according to intelligence officers with knowledge of the meeting and congressional officials who were briefed on it. Trump, they said, pointed at the map and said he knew that Nepal was part of India, only to be told that it is an independent nation. When said he was familiar with Bhutan and knew it, too, was part of India, his briefers told him that Bhutan was an independent kingdom. Last August, Politico reported on president’s mispronunciation of the names of the two countries during the same briefing. But the disconnect between Trump and his intelligence briefers is no joke, the officials say. Several pointed to concerns regarding Trump’s assessment of the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. After Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last summer, the North claimed to have destroyed its major underground nuclear testing facility at Punggye-ri, and Trump has gone out of his way to credit the claim.The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGIA), which oversees the spy satellites that map and photograph key areas, had tried to impress upon Trump the size and complexity of the North Korean site. In preparing one briefing for the President on the issue early in his administration, the NGIA built a model of the facility with a removable roof, according to two officials. To help Trump grasp the size of the facility, the NGIA briefers built a miniature version New York’s Statue of Liberty to scale and put it inside the model.Intelligence officials from multiple agencies later warned Trump that entrances at the facility that had been closed after the summit could still be reopened. But the president has ignored the agencies’ warnings and has exaggerated the steps North Korea has taken to shutter the facility, those officials and two others say. That is a particular concern now, ahead of a possible second summit with the Kim Jong-Un later this month.The briefers’ concerns are spread across multiple areas of expertise. Two briefers worry that a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping could produce a trade agreement that the President can trumpet but that fails to address China’s espionage, its theft of intellectual property that ranges from circuit boards to soybean hybrids, its military buildup, and its geopolitical ambition. These accomplishments of Chinese espionage are, in no way, shape, or form President Donald Trump’s fault, but they do put on full display the complete and total failure of all seventeen Intelligence Agencies. Let’s not even talk about national security risk created by the CEO of the leader in AI technology traveling to China and spending several weeks there. Not only could they have downloaded every bit technological intelligence that this man ever conceived but they also could have programmed him to respond with totally robotic precision to weaponize Bing to cause all kinds of havoc, such as the kind of, totally out of character road rage that resulted a clinging to the hood of another man’s car for dear life. Has the intelligence community even begun to develop the kind of “Third Eye” technology that I have championing for a year that can record the images being displayed on the monitor to determine if a machine-based app is subliminally causing people to respond to everyday events with extremely exaggerated rage? This is just the kind of thing that China would do, to gradually increase the level of chaos in our society at this most critical point in history, when China has broken the most rule of nature that they know very well is the one that they must not cross. They’re arrogance has led them to the one place they didn’t want to go, and it is their arrogance that will bring them to their knees with their neck sticking out. If you can’t grasp a clue just ask a Hopi. They have a fine understanding of nature and God is nature and God is not just of this world, but God is of the entire universe and all that that entails. China is very strong now and China has been very patient in nudging the world ever closer to the edge, but the Founding Fathers, with the help of mother earth, gave birth to the living Constitution of the United States of America and nothing can change that if we stand together in support of our President, Mr. Donald Trump. Not even if Jeb Bush burnt the original in the ugly shrine, he put it in in Philadelphia. The United States Constitution lives on, as long as we uphold the “Rule of Law” and “Due Process”Three other officials worry about what one of them calls “precipitous troop withdrawals” from Syria and Afghanistan and a peace deal with the Taliban that in time would leave the extremist Islamic group back in charge and wipe out the gains made in education, women’s rights and governance since the U.S. invaded the country more than 17 years ago.For now, the briefers are heartened by the intelligence community leaders who risked Trump’s ire by contradicting him in public testimony this week. The danger, one former intelligence official said, is that those leaders and other intelligence briefers may eventually stop taking such risks in laying out the facts for the President.  Our first demand is that all government officials, city, county, state and federal employees and elected officials begin wearing audio and video that can live stream all official business to achieve the highest level of transparency possible. The audio must be only capable of recording with no speaker capability. When someone is being overly repetitious with the wearer of the audio recorder it should be enhanced to ring the wearers cell phone so they can excuse themselves to study the audio and video record. This demand will free you from being programmed to regain your logical thought process and you will realize that all the rest of the demands are the most commonsense things to do. Once you regain your freewill and logical mind and are no longer locked into a program that just barely allows you the ability to do your job you will likely wonder why the more efficient county sovereignty methods were not enacted long ago, when the WVU professor was petitioning for them, or when Thomas Jefferson and so many of the Founding Fathers were pressing for them? The answer is that China began working against everything that makes sense long, long ago. I mentioned that democracy and religion are China’s old enemies but there is a third old enemy, an educated public, more specifically, the advancement of science and the true understanding of the nature of things. The Catholic Church and most of the world’s great religions held a strong commitment to the advancement of education of the public and finding the truth. China became a country ruled by programming that leads to extreme paranoia and the more paranoid their leadership became the more controlling they became. They worked to keep their population ignorant and they found they could control them more easily by keeping them in a state of chaos. When they decided that they must control the entire world to satisfy their paranoia, they chose to go against all of the things in other societies that brought stability to society. This is why corruption plays such a prominent role and the unprecedentedly high levels of corruption throughout all of our governing bodies is a significant sign of how effectively China has been able to influence our society. Getting us to allow the formation of the secret agency, the FBI, and getting an African American that hated the fact that he was an African American and tried to hide it, and was a cross dressing gay man in a period when this was unheard of, and that he denied that organized crime existed, a claim that went in face of the obvious for over twenty years are proof that J. Edgar Hoover was a victim of the same kind of programming that was supposedly not invented until the CIA started the MK Ultra program forty years later. The obvious reason this could happen is because the CIA did not invent it, China has been using this type of programming for thousands of years and the CIA was not just infiltrated by dupes of Chinese intelligence, the CIA was started by dupes of Chinese intelligence.The fact that Big Tech has not latched onto the idea of developing a technology that will free this country from the hideous depths of corruption that is destroying us from within, is strong evidence that rather than being the open-minded inventers they portray themselves to be, they are closed minded dupes themselves.Mr. President, Sir, the barrier should be secondary to inspection stations. Every vehicle crossing the border must be thoroughly searched and every small aircraft must be tracked to where it lands and searched. The barrier is important and makes the job of knowing who is entering our country easier but drugs and human trafficking are driving right in or flying in. Democrats may find funding for greater overt border security more appealing if the first use of border protection funding is for inspection stations. The top priority should be to triple the number of inspection stations in southern California and McAllen Texas and any other location that thoroughly inspecting the contents of every vehicle will create excessive waiting times. Here are some specifics that we need right away. As Commander and Chief of the military, please sir, give explicit orders that when groups of unarmed people enter this country or an occupied country that they be ordered to separate themselves into family groups and that the military must see to it that they are kept together as a family unit during all processing. No more ridiculous references to prayer rugs being found on the Texas side of the border as if this is a clear sign that terrorists are entering the country illegally, all Muslims are not terrorists and the “Attack at Garland” clearly indicates that the FBI played a significant role in getting two men killed.  No razor wire on our borders, no tear-gas being used against unarmed refugees fleeing the results of the drug trade in Central America.  This will likely become more common as the CIA and FBI are forced to use ever larger numbers of refugees as a tactic to try to justify their own existence. Who are the most responsible for bringing drugs into this country?  Who are the most responsible for the world’s drug problem? Who are the most responsible for training terrorists in this country and abroad? Why does China have access to our most sophisticated technology? Everyone knows the answers to these questions. China hasn’t had to steel our technology because our IC has handed it over to them. The FBI and CIA and all the rest were started by dupes of China. They will continue to do China’s bidding, creating vacuums for China’s puppet states like Iran to walk right in. The National Emergency that we are facing now is caused by the fact that our most vital national defenses were put under an agency that must be funded separately from the Defense Department. This must be corrected by putting the National Guard under the Department of Defense and putting the Coast Guard, US Customs and Border Protection, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the United States Secret Service (with a new name such Presidential Body Guards with the secrecy ended), the Civil Air Patrol and the Transportation Security Administration under the National Guard as a full-time enlisted division of the National Guard. The Drug Enforcement Agency should also be brought under the National Guard so that all small aircraft or any size plane that would not be searched if it wasn’t known that they crossed the border, can be tracked to their destination and the search can be coordinated between the DEA and the Transportation Security Administration. The main objective of this is to end DHS with its entire hierarchy taking early retirement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should be a stand-alone  agency that is required to be funded a year in advance. Order the Department of Defense to begin enlisting all federal employees in the military that wish to continue drawing a pay check and order the military to take charge of national security using only overt methods and to put all federal employees seeking enlistment in any branch immediately on the pay-role. This would actually be a good first phase of firing all 2.2 million federal employees so that adequate overt security is already in place. The entire intelligence community, the utterly corrupt DOJ and DOS will try to justify their own existence, but it must be ended for our democracy, and by extension, all democracy in the world to survive. We need to get them into third eye technology so they can begin to deprogram themselves and this could be done by having the National Guard issue “Third Eye” technology to ex-federal employees as they come to them. They must be allowed freedom to deprogram themselves, reprogramming or re-educating as China prefers to refer to it in their concentration camps is not the answer. The ex-employees of the 14 secret agencies that Wikipedia refers to as our intelligence community must be issued “Third Eye” technology by the National Guard if they show up to enlist and assigned an office where they can begin documenting their past five years of employment, deprogramming themselves without being disturbed or assisted so they can regain their freewill on their own and regain enough logical thought to give intelligent recommendations as to how we can better address the issues they were dealing with using overt security.Pulling out of Syria is absolutely the right thing to do. Now, do right by our allies, the Kurds, and work with them to pull back into northern Iraq and negotiate the move with Erdogan so that it is a peacefully orchestrated move. If we do not engage in nation-building, we are creating vacuums for China to fill by using a puppet state like Iran. China is the problem that the world must face, and we can only win by backing fully transparent democracy that makes secrecy of any kind strictly against the law. In fact, we must insist that the new democracies of Iraq, Afghanistan and northern Africa seriously consider stating explicitly in their national and state constitutions that secrecy of any kind is unconstitutional. Build up active duty forces with more than four years-experience in Iraq, Afghanistan and northern Africa. Africa is “The Lynch Pin” and we must win it by outdoing China on every front. We must make a commitment to backing only democracy in the world. “Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.” - George Washington – A Parliament is just a stepping stone to communism and the UK would have sat by and watched as Germany mowed down Europe if it had not been for Winston Churchill. Jarod Kushner should deliver the message to uncle Netanyahu that  Israel will begin  pulling out of all areas of the land promised to Palestinians and allowing and arranging for the transfer of ownership of all land and housing to Palestine as recognized by the United States. Netanyahu is to oversee the ending of all secrecy by Israel and initiate the use of “Third Eye” technology by all elected officials, government employees and the military. The military is to pull back inside these boundaries to occupy and defend only recognized lands of Israel. Jarod will deliver his uncle the message that the first time he is seen as faltering in achieving these goals the US will intervene. Jarod Kushner will deliver the message to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that all military support for fighting will end and sales of weapons will be postponed until Saudi Arabia withdraws from Yemen and begins transitioning from a monarchial dictatorship to a governing body chosen by the people. The Crown Prince should be informed that the US will begin providing humanitarian aid to Yemen unilaterally without military support and if anyone attempts to interfere with the United States effort at reconstruction in Yemen, Saudi Arabia will handle it because if the US military must be called upon in Yemen the Crown Prince will be held personally responsible.Negotiate with the European Union to begin airlifting refugees out of Germany and the other countries that have had to deal with large numbers of refugees, provided they use their militaries to drive Russia out of the Ukraine and Crimea. Call on the State Governors to immediately begin putting in place, in-state “home-confinement” monitoring capabilities and working with county sheriff departments in conjunction with jailers to do the monitoring, to be able to release all prisoners on home-confinement including accessary to murder but not murderers. Give convicted murderers two options, either take a Yurt and a Dutch oven and live in exile in the Yukon with no chance of travelling outside the Yukon or be housed in a federal tent prison on the southern border. This will free up prison beds to be used for secure housing for refugees being air lifted out of Europe and entering the country on the Mexican border who have been vetted and have family or friends living in the vicinity of the jail. All young Iraqis and Afghans that wish to return to their country as border patrols and peace keeping forces should also be encouraged to join our military.Allowing Iran to move into Iraq is not an acceptable result of our efforts there. Nor is allowing the CIA to run opiates out of Afghanistan. Remember, the Taliban were our allies and the “Freedom Fighters” when Ronald Reagan was in office. Maybe the reason the Taliban are our enemies now is because they were having such great success in shutting down the growth of Poppies. The reason our media is so controversial is because the CIA has infiltrated every portion of our media. The CIA is engaging in unconstitutional practices when it infiltrates the media. None of the intelligence community, including the FBI and CIA, is a constitutional part of our government and frankly, they are our biggest liability as we enter into a “Cold War” with China. This must be our chanted mantra, “Only overt, no more covert”, the mantra for all future democracies as the US attempts to educate the world that secrecy of any kind is China’s greatest ally in achieving their goal of total world control.  “Maduro has stopped torturing democracy in Venezuela – by killing it” by Christopher Sabatini. “Was democracy’s death knell in 2004 when the then president, Hugo Chávez – the founder of the Bolivarian revolution – expanded the supreme court by 12 seats, from 20 to 32, in order to pack it with loyalists, so undermining the independence of the judicial system? Was it in 2015 when the democratic opposition won a two-thirds “super” majority in the national legislature, only for the pro-government electoral commission to block three legislators from taking their seats under false claims of elections violations? Was it in 2016, when President Nicolás Maduro appointed a loyalist Chavista general, Vladimir Padrino López, to occupy the positions of both defence minister and state tsar for food and the economy, and stipulated that all state ministers should report to the general? (Current or former military officers run 11 of Venezuela’s 32 state ministries.) Or was it in October that year, when the electoral commission indefinitely suspended state and local elections – leaving Venezuelans without locally elected officials – and blocked a constitutional referendum on the government out of fear the governing party would be defeated?” (Following quote, source unknown.) “The ruling Socialist Party with the help of the country’s top court has turned the Congress into a mostly symbolic entity, replacing its day-to-day functions with an all-powerful body called the Constituent Assembly.”President Donald Trump, thank you sir for this message to Venezuela; The citizens of Venezuela have suffered for too long at the hands of the illegitimate Maduro regime. Today, I have officially recognized the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaido, as the Interim President of Venezuela. This is the best news I have ever heard in my life! I have been watching a lot of news on this situation in Venezuela and the comparisons to the “Bay of Pigs”. What worries me the most is that Pence, Pompeo and Bolton might try to lure you into giving the go ahead on a clandestine coup attempt that is destined to fail. The talk surrounding your State of the Union address seems to be good reasons to use greater commonsense in dealing with your own security for the next couple of months or until this situation has stabilized. If you can restore democracy in Venezuela, continuing to make public appearances is not necessary, you will win in 2020 by a landslide without campaigning at all.  The wiser thing to do in this situation is to call on the American Red Cross, the United Way and American people to provide containers of food and medicine and bring container ships to ports from Miami to Galveston to deliver the humanitarian aid in a big way to Venezuela. Rather than fall into the trap of being responsible for getting thousands of people killed and looking like a schmuck, make the argument before Congress that you want their approval, not to declare war on Venezuela, but to use the military to insure the safe delivery of the food and medical supplies to all 23 states and the 109 cities. Make sure that the aid gets to the people by providing military escorts for the tractor trailer convoys delivering the supplies and, most importantly, make sure that the people of Venezuela are not massacred by the Venezuelan military. Maduro must be sent the message that humanitarian aid is on the way with a military escort with strict orders to keep the peace. Maduro should also be made aware that he can avoid facing the consequences of legal action over the steps he has taken to undermine the Venezuelan democracy by stepping down and fully supporting the distribution of food and medical supplies during this transition period. By getting Congress to approve the use of the military as escorts it will prove your respect for democracy, and you will be able to handle this dangerous situation in a way that provides immediate aid to the Venezuelan people. This should be handled entirely through the use of overt security. Further goals must be to free the political prisoners that allows them to participate in free and fair elections. I am hopeful if we can get humanitarian aid to the people of Venezuela that we might call for fasting and prayer until their local grocery store shelves are full to capacity and their economy is becoming more diversified.                                          Google CEO: Fears about artificial intelligence are 'very legitimate'The Washington Post 12, 12, 2018Google CEO Sundar Pichai, head of one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence companies, said in an interview this week that concerns about harmful applications of the technology are “very legitimate” — but the tech industry should be trusted to responsibly regulate its use. Speaking with The Washington Post on Tuesday afternoon, Pichai said that new AI tools — the backbone of innovations such as driverless cars and disease-detecting algorithms — require companies to set ethical guardrails and think through how the technology can be abused. “I think tech has to realize it just can’t build it, and then fix it,” Pichai said. “I think that doesn’t work.” Tech giants have to ensure that artificial intelligence with “agency of its own” doesn’t harm humankind, Pichai said. He said he is optimistic about the technology’s long-term benefits, but his assessment of the potential risks of AI parallels that of some tech critics who say the technology could be used to empower invasive surveillance, deadly weaponry and the spread of misinformation. Other tech executives, like SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, have offered more dire predictions that AI could prove to be “far more dangerous than nukes.”  “AI could prove to be ‘far more dangerous than nukes.’” — “but the tech industry should be trusted to responsibly regulate its use.”“REALLY! Why? Based on their track record and the fact that machine based algorithms have not been decoded to understand what commands were given to the computer to create them, such as language learning apps, are all over the internet now and are highly likely to be making dupes of us all, this calls for very serious government oversight by free thinking elected officials unencumbered by trying to micromanage the needs of the entire US population.” Google’s AI technology underpins a range of initiatives, from the company’s controversial China project to the surfacing of hateful conspiratorial videos on its YouTube subsidiary — a problem he vowed to address in the coming year. How Google decides to deploy its AI has also sparked recent employee unrest. Pichai’s call for self-regulation followed his testimony in Congress, where lawmakers threatened to impose limits on technology in response to its misuse, including as a conduit for spreading misinformation and hate speech. His acknowledgement about the potential threats posed by AI was a critical assertion because the Indian-born engineer often has touted the world-shaping implications of automated systems that could learn and make decisions without human control. Pichai said in the interview that lawmakers around the world are still trying to grasp AI’s effects and the potential need for government regulation. “Sometimes I worry people underestimate the scale of change that’s possible in the mid-to-long term, and I think the questions are actually pretty complex,” he said. Other tech giants, including Microsoft, recently have embraced regulation of AI — both by the companies that create the technology and the governments that oversee its use. But AI, if handled properly, could have “tremendous benefits,” Pichai explained, including helping doctors detect eye disease and other ailments through automated scans of health data. “Regulating a technology in its early days is hard, but I do think companies should self-regulate,” he said. “This is why we’ve tried hard to articulate a set of AI principles. We may not have gotten everything right, but we thought it was important to start a conversation.” Pichai, who joined Google in 2004 and became chief executive 11 years later, in January called AI “one of the most important things that humanity is working on.” He said it could prove to be “more profound” for human society than “electricity or fire.” But the race to perfect machines that can operate on their own has rekindled familiar fears that Silicon Valley’s corporate ethos — “move fast and break things,” as Facebook once put it — could result in powerful, imperfect technology eliminating jobs and harming average people. Within Google, its AI efforts also have created controversy: The company faced heavy criticism earlier this year due to its work on a Defense Department contract involving AI that could automatically tag cars, buildings and other objects for use in military drones. Some employees resigned due to what they called Google’s profiting off the “business of war.” Asked about the employee backlash, Pichai told The Post that his workers were “an important part of our culture.” “They definitely have an input, and it’s an important input; it’s something I cherish,” he said. In June, after announcing that Google wouldn’t renew the contract next year, Pichai unveiled a set of AI-ethics principles that included general bans on developing systems that could be used to cause harm, damage human rights or aid in “surveillance violating internationally accepted norms.” The company faced earlier criticism for releasing AI tools that could be misused in the wrong hands. Google’s release in 2015 of its internal machine-learning software, TensorFlow, has helped accelerate the wide-scale development of AI, but it has also been used to automate the creation of lifelike fake videos that have been used for harassment and disinformation. Google and Pichai have defended the release by saying that keeping the technology restricted could lead to less public oversight and prevent developers and researchers from progressing its capabilities in beneficial ways. “Over time, as you make progress, I think it’s important to have conversations around ethics (and) bias, and make simultaneous progress,” Pichai said during his interview with The Post. “In some sense, you do want to develop ethical frameworks, engage noncomputer scientists in the field early on,” he said. “You have to involve humanity in a more representative way, because the technology is going to affect humanity.” Pichai likened the early work to set parameters around AI to the academic community’s efforts in the early days of genetics research. “Many biologists started drawing lines on where the technology should go,” he said. “There’s been a lot of self-regulation by the academic community, which I think has been extraordinarily important.” The Google executive said it would be most essential around the development of autonomous weapons, an issue that’s rankled tech executives and employees. In July, thousands of tech workers representing companies including Google signed a pledge against developing AI tools that could be programmed to kill. Pichai also said he found some hateful, conspiratorial YouTube videos described in a Washington Post story on Tuesday “abhorrent,” and he indicated that the company would work to improve its systems for detecting problematic content. The videos, which had been watched millions of times on YouTube since appearing in April, discussed baseless allegations that Democrat Hillary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin had attacked, killed and drank the blood of a girl. Pichai said he had not seen the videos, which he was questioned about during the congressional hearing, and he declined to say whether YouTube’s shortcomings in this area were a result of limits in the detection systems or in policies for evaluating whether a particular video should be removed. But he added, “You’ll see us in 2019 continue to do more here.” Just what we need, monopoly tech practicing censorship to protect the swamp monsters from the unimaginably, hideously, ugly truth. The Bush boys are running scared and pulling out all of the stops, now that mommy and daddy are no longer around to protect them, they should call Dick Chaney daddy now.Pichai also portrayed Google’s efforts to develop a new product for the government-controlled Chinese internet market as preliminary, declining to say what the product might be or when it would come to market - if ever. Dubbed Project Dragonfly, the effort has caused backlash among employees and human-rights activists who warn about the possibility of Google assisting government surveillance in a country that tolerates little political dissent. When asked whether it’s possible that Google might make a product that allows Chinese officials to know who searches for sensitive terms, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, Pichai said it was too soon to make any such judgments. “It’s a hypothetical,” Pichai said. “We are so far away from being in that position.”As if he were with the FBI, IT’S NOT AN ANSWER to the question at all, and a total lie because Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA has been doing exactly this sort of thing for years and it is a serious concern no matter who perpetrates such invasions of privacy! The fact that this CEO is allowed to travel to China to share AI technology is proof that monopoly tech was not put in place to protect technology that can be weaponized from falling into the wrong hands and further proof that the FBI and CIA do nothing to protect this country from China. On the contrary, through the influence of the FBI and the CIA everything they have done in the name of this country for fifty years has destroyed the worlds opinion of who we are and thrown us under the China bus. If the mafia doesn’t exist now it’s only because the FBI is the mafia now, they have been close friends since Hoover did them the favor of claiming they didn’t exist, how else could casino’s get onto Native American reservations. Shock therapy and acupuncture are actually ancient Chinese torture treatments and when they are combined, they are the most formidable torture weapon ever created and you can bet your life that China now knows ever errant thought that ever passed through Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s brain regarding the advancement of computer technology  or any other subject he may have pondered on. Without leaving a scratch nor a memory in his head of the experience.The US and China are in a quantum arms race that will transform warfare: Radar that can spot stealth aircraft and other quantum innovations could give their militaries a strategic edge. by Martin Giles January 3, 2019 MIT Technology ReviewIn the 1970s, at the height of the Cold War, American military planners began to worry about the threat to US warplanes posed by new, radar-guided missile defenses in the USSR and other nations. In response, engineers at places like US defense giant Lockheed Martin’s famous “Skunk Works” stepped up work on stealth technology that could shield aircraft from the prying eyes of enemy radar. The innovations that resulted include unusual shapes that deflect radar waves—like the US B-2 bomber’s “flying wing” design (above)—as well as carbon-based materials and novel paints. Stealth technology isn’t yet a Harry Potter–like invisibility cloak: even today’s most advanced warplanes still reflect some radar waves. But these signals are so small and faint they get lost in background noise, allowing the aircraft to pass unnoticed.China and Russia have since gotten stealth aircraft of their own, but America’s are still better. They have given the US the advantage in launching surprise attacks in campaigns like the war in Iraq that began in 2003. This advantage is now under threat. In November 2018, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), China’s biggest defense electronics company, unveiled a prototype radar that it claims can detect stealth aircraft in flight. The radar uses some of the exotic phenomena of quantum physics to help reveal planes’ locations.It’s just one of several quantum-inspired technologies that could change the face of warfare. As well as unstealthing aircraft, they could bolster the security of battlefield communications and affect the ability of submarines to navigate the oceans undetected. The pursuit of these technologies is triggering a new arms race between the US and China, which sees the emerging quantum era as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain the edge over its rival in military tech.Stealth spotterHow quickly quantum advances will influence military power will depend on the work of researchers like Jonathan Baugh. A professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada, Baugh is working on a device that’s part of a bigger project to develop quantum radar. Its intended users: stations in the Arctic run by the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, a joint US-Canadian organization. Baugh’s machine generates pairs of photons that are “entangled”—a phenomenon that means the particles of light share a single quantum state. A change in one photon immediately influences the state of the other, even if they are separated by vast distances.Quantum radar operates by taking one photon from every pair generated and firing it out in a microwave beam. The other photon from each pair is held back inside the radar system. Only a few of the photons sent out will be reflected back if they hit a stealth aircraft. A conventional radar wouldn’t be able to distinguish these returning photons from the mass of other incoming ones created by natural phenomena—or by radar-jamming devices. But a quantum radar can check for evidence that incoming photons are entangled with the ones held back. Any that are must have originated at the radar station. This enables it to detect even the faintest of return signals in a mass of background noise.Baugh cautions that there are still big engineering challenges. These include developing highly reliable streams of entangled photons and building extremely sensitive detectors. It’s hard to know if CETC, which already claimed in 2016 that its radar could detect objects up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, has solved these challenges; it’s keeping the technical details of its prototype a secret.Seth Lloyd, an MIT professor who developed the theory underpinning quantum radar, says that in the absence of hard evidence, he’s skeptical of the Chinese company’s claims. But, he adds, the potential of quantum radar isn’t in doubt. When a fully functioning device is finally deployed, it will mark the beginning of the end of the stealth era.China’s ambitionsCETC’s work is part of a long-term effort by China to turn itself into a world leader in quantum technology. The country is providing generous funding for new quantum research centers at universities and building a national research center for quantum science that’s slated to open in 2020. It’s already leaped ahead of the US in registering patents in quantum communications and cryptography.A study of China’s quantum strategy published in September 2018 by the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a US think tank, noted that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is recruiting quantum specialists, and that big defense companies like China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) are setting up joint quantum labs at universities. Working out exactly which projects have a military element to them is hard, though. “There’s a degree of opacity and ambiguity here, and some of that may be deliberate,” says Elsa Kania, a coauthor of the CNAS study.China’s efforts are ramping up just as fears are growing that the US military is losing its competitive edge. A commission tasked by Congress to review the Trump administration’s defense strategy issued a report in November 2018 warning that the US margin of superiority “is profoundly diminished in key areas” and called for more investment in new battlefield technologies.One of those technologies is likely to be quantum communication networks. Chinese researchers have already built a satellite that can send quantum-encrypted messages between distant locations, as well as a terrestrial network that stretches between Beijing and Shanghai. Both projects were developed by scientific researchers, but the know-how and infrastructure could easily be adapted for military use.The networks rely on an approach known as quantum key distribution (QKD). Messages are encoded in the form of classical bits, and the cryptographic keys needed to decode them are sent as quantum bits, or qubits. These qubits are typically photons that can travel easily across fiber-optic networks or through the atmosphere. If an enemy tries to intercept and read the qubits, this immediately destroys their delicate quantum state, wiping out the information they carry and leaving a telltale sign of an intrusion.QKD technology isn’t totally secure yet. Long ground networks require way stations  similar to the repeaters that boost signals along an ordinary data cable. At these stations, the keys are decoded into classical form before being re-encoded in a quantum form and sent to the next station. While the keys are in classical form, an enemy could hack in and copy them undetected.To overcome this issue, a team of researchers at the US Army Research Laboratory in Adelphi, Maryland, is working on an approach called quantum teleportation. This involves using entanglement to transfer data between a qubit held by a sender and another held by a receiver, using what amounts to a kind of virtual, one-time-only quantum data cable. Michael Brodsky, one of the researchers, says he and his colleagues have been working on a number of technical challenges, including finding ways to ensure that the qubits’ delicate quantum state isn’t disrupted during transmission through fiber-optic networks. The technology is still confined to a lab, but the team says it’s now robust enough to be tested outside. “The racks can be put on trucks, and the trucks can be moved to the field,” explains Brodsky.It may not be long before China is testing its own quantum teleportation system. Researchers are already building the fiber-optic network for one that will stretch from the city of Zhuhai, near Macau, to some islands in Hong Kong.Quantum compassResearchers are also exploring using quantum approaches to deliver more accurate and foolproof navigation tools to the military. US aircraft and naval vessels already rely on precise atomic clocks to help keep track of where they are. But they also count on signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS), a network of satellites orbiting Earth. This poses a risk because an enemy could falsify, or “spoof,” GPS signals—or jam them altogether.Lockheed Martin thinks American sailors could use a quantum compass based on microscopic synthetic diamonds with atomic flaws known as nitrogen-vacancy centers, or NV centers. These quantum defects in the diamond lattice can be harnessed to form an extremely accurate magnetometer. Shining a laser on diamonds with NV centers makes them emit light at an intensity that varies according to the surrounding magnetic field.Ned Allen, Lockheed’s chief scientist, says the magnetometer is great at detecting magnetic anomalies—distinctive variations in Earth’s magnetic field caused by magnetic deposits or rock formations. There are already detailed maps of these anomalies made by satellite and terrestrial surveys. By comparing anomalies detected using the magnetometer against these maps, navigators can determine where they are. Because the magnetometer also indicates the orientation of magnetic fields, ships and submarines can use them to work out which direction they are heading.China’s military is clearly worried about threats to its own version of GPS, known as BeiDou. Research into quantum navigation and sensing technology is under way at various institutes across the country, according to the CNAS report.As well as being used for navigation, magnetometers can also detect and track the movement of large metallic objects, like submarines, by fluctuations they cause in local magnetic fields. Because they are very sensitive, the magnetometers are easily disrupted by background noise, so for now they are used for detection only at very short distances. But last year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences let slip that some Chinese researchers had found a way to compensate for this using quantum technology. That might mean the devices could be used in the future to spot submarines at much longer ranges.A tight raceIt’s still early days for militaries' use of quantum technologies. There’s no guarantee they will work well at scale, or in conflict situations where absolute reliability is essential. But if they do succeed, quantum encryption and quantum radar could make a particularly big impact. Code-breaking and radar helped change the course of World War II. Quantum communications could make stealing secret messages much harder, or impossible. Quantum radar would render stealth planes as visible as ordinary ones. Both things would be game-changing. It’s also too early to tell whether it will be China or the US that comes out on top in the quantum arms race—or whether it will lead to a Cold War–style stalemate. But the money China is pouring into quantum research is a sign of how determined it is to take the lead. China has also managed to cultivate close working relationships between government research institutes, universities, and companies like CSIC and CETC.The US, by comparison, has only just passed legislation to create a national plan for coordinating public and private efforts. The delay in adopting such an approach has led to a lot of siloed projects and could slow the development of useful military applications. “We’re trying to get the research community to take more of a systems approach,” says Brodsky, the US army quantum expert.Still, the US military does have some distinct advantages over the PLA. The Department of Defense has been investing in quantum research for a very long time, as have US spy agencies. The knowledge generated helps explains why US companies lead in areas like the development of powerful quantum computers, which harness entangled qubits to generate immense amounts of processing power. The American military can also tap into work being done by its allies and by a vibrant academic research community at home. Baugh’s radar research, for instance, is funded by the Canadian government, and the US is planning a joint research initiative with its closest military partners—Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand—in areas like quantum navigation. All this has given the US a head start in the quantum arms race. But China’s impressive effort to turbocharge quantum research means the gap between them is closing fast.Martin Giles San Francisco Bureau Chief: I am the San Francisco bureau chief of MIT Technology Review, where I cover the future of computing and the companies in Silicon Valley that are shaping it. Before joining the publication, I led research and publishing at a venture capital firm focused on business technology. Prior to that, I worked for The Economist for many years as a reporter and editor, most recently as the paper’s West Coast-based tech writer. “How quickly quantum advances will influence military power will depend on the work of researchers like Jonathan Baugh. A professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada, Baugh is working on a device that’s part of a bigger project to develop quantum radar.” The US Military needs to reevaluate how secure the most sophisticated technology is when China is acquiring it at an alarming rate. The red print above are security risks. Fort Knox is an incredibly secure facility and should be audited in a very public way. If it is mostly empty now, as has been rumored since the eighties, it would make an incredibly secure research facility. We should put ten billion dollars into Quantum communications and Quantum radar yesterday and lure such people as Mr. Baugh here to do his research so that we can rest assured that China does not get access to it. The defense department should be ready and willing to commit to fully overt security by now with all of the lost advantages in technology. The new useless and defunct NSA ease dropping facility would be another highly secure location to do Quantum research and guard our discoveries to keep democracy from falling victim to China. China will be loyal no one no matter what they have done for China. China is the most paranoid of all governing bodies on earth. “The Killing Fields” is the most explicit description of how China will handle the world if they achieve their goal. “Google CEO Sundar Pichai, head of one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence companies,”…  “I think tech has to realize it just can’t build it, and then fix it,” Pichai said. “I think that doesn’t work.” Tech giants have to ensure that artificial intelligence with “agency of its own” doesn’t harm humankind, Pichai said. He said he is optimistic about the technology’s long-term benefits, but his assessment of the potential risks of AI parallels that of some tech critics who say the technology could be used to empower invasive surveillance, deadly weaponry and the spread of misinformation. Other tech executives, like SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, have offered more dire predictions that AI could prove to be “far more dangerous than nukes.”  The fact that this man is allowed to work in this field without agreeing in advance that he will not travel outside the mainland while doing this kind of research and for at least ten years after he has retired from it is a prime example why all of the buffoons bumping into each other in the Intelligence Community need to enlist in the military and be assigned a room in which to work on a draft stating what they have done for the past five years and how they think these issues can best be handled using overt security. Then if any of what they have written down can be read at all we might get some usefulness out of this bunch of clowns. Freedom is one thing, but stupid is a whole different ball of wax. The only time this government worries about protecting anyone’s freedoms is when it comes to letting them give away technology to the only enemy that anyone in the world should be concerned about, China. We have just about blown any real good chance of defeating China’s quest to rule the world but it will all hinge entirely on whether we can get behind our United States Constitution and remove the blight of unconstitutional secretive and secret institutions that have compromised our elected officials and have them engaging in activities that no human would do without being forced into and then they are capable of programming them to say they like what they are doing and don’t want to change. The bottom line is that anyone can be programmed to do any hideous act and regardless of how horribly repulsed they are at what they have done they can be programmed to say they like it. Here’s how bad the problem is with the field of psychology, two ancient Chinese torture treatments, shock treatment and acupuncture have been accepted as legitimate therapy.    China and Russia Have Set a Nuclear Collision Course With the United States Gordon G. Chang, The Daily Beast Tue, Sep 4 , 2018China, the New York Times reported last week, “can now challenge American military supremacy in the places that matter most to it: the waters around Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.” Therefore, Beijing can, in the words of the paper, “make intervention in the region too costly for Washington to contemplate.” Too costly to contemplate? Unfortunately, assessments like these, often heard in U.S. policy circles, can embolden the already arrogant Chinese and make their adventurism—and war—more likely.Moreover, any conflict between China and the United States in the Pacific could quickly escalate to nuclear war. China, surpassing the U.S. last year, now boasts the world’s largest navy, and it is adding to its fleet “at a stunning rate,” according to the Times. Even last year, the count was lopsided with China claiming 317 surface vessels and subs in active service and the U.S. 283.Of course, it’s not clear how capable the People’s Liberation Army Navy is. The PLAN, as it is known, has never participated in a large-scale wartime engagement at sea, and its fleet is not, on the whole, as modern as America’s.Nonetheless, China has a few critical advantages. Its naval assets are concentrated along its shores and U.S. forces are spread around the globe; areas of likely conflict are near China and far from America; and the PLAN has some crucial weapons that are better than those of the United States, especially anti-ship missiles. Beijing has also gone big into “asymmetric” warfare, for instance militarizing fishing fleets, enlisting the “little blue men” of what has become a maritime militia.“Beijing has clearly relished challenging the U.S. Navy and Air Force.”The Chinese also have one other advantage: the will to use force to take what is in the possession of others. In their peripheral seas, they grabbed control of the Paracel Islands, in the northern portion of the South China Sea, from South Vietnam in 1974 after a short battle. The Chinese also seized Mischief Reef from the Philippines in a series of actions from late 1994 to early 1995, and they snatched Scarborough Shoal, also from Manila, in early 2012. Now, China is, among other things, pressuring other Philippine features in the South China Sea and using menacing tactics to take over a chain of uninhabited islets currently under Japanese control in the East China Sea.Moreover, Beijing has clearly relished challenging the U.S. Navy and Air Force in the global commons, threatening and on occasion harassing American ships, planes, and drones. The seizure of an American drone in international waters in December 2016, in sight of the USNS Bowditch and in defiance of radio commands, was brazen and nothing short of an act of war.Moreover, Beijing’s harassment of the USNS Impeccable in March 2009 in the South China Sea, using its maritime militia, was so severe that it constituted an attack on the United States. “The key point is that China accepts the risk of escalation to a greater extent than does the U.S., because China uses confrontation to alter the status quo in its favor,” Anders Corr, editor of Great Powers, Grand Strategies: The New Game in the South China Sea, told the National Interest at the beginning of this year. China is apparently willing to escalate all the way. But the New York Times, in its reporting last month, did not mention one Chinese threat to American forces in the region: nuclear attack. “For regional warfare, especially in Asia, the People’s Liberation Army is equipped for nuclear operations both offensive and defensive.”— Richard Fisher of the International Assessment and Strategy Center “For regional warfare, especially in Asia, the People’s Liberation Army is equipped for nuclear operations both offensive and defensive,” Richard Fisher of the International Assessment and Strategy Center told The Daily Beast. “If China can conjure a ‘defensive’ political moral high ground to justify offensive military campaigns to retrieve ‘lost’ territory, we should be prepared for China’s very early use of nuclear weapons to support its theater campaign. We can, for example, expect China to ‘demonstrate’ nuclear weapons at sea to deter American or Japanese military support for Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, or even outright Chinese use of nuclear weapons against Japanese bases supporting U.S. forces coming to the defense of Taiwan.”And American planners have to be concerned that China’s military partner, Russia, would join a conflict on Beijing’s side. In September 2016 the two militaries, in an eight-day naval drill, practiced “joint island seizing missions” in the South China Sea. Moscow might even take advantage of turmoil in Asia to try to further expand its territory in Europe, perhaps using “little green men” as it did in Crimea in 2014 and later in Eastern Ukraine. Or maybe its nukes. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has long threatened the offensive use of such weapons. As Stephen Blank, a scholar at the American Foreign Policy Council, told me, “Russia evidently views nuclear weapons as a legitimate war-fighting weapon as its deployments, 22 procurement programs, exercises, and doctrine suggest.” He notes that Moscow is constructing a nuclear weapons storage facility in Crimea and deploying nuclear-capable Kalibr cruise missiles to the Mediterranean.China has an announced “no-first-use” policy, but for decades hostile public statements from Chinese generals and diplomats have cast doubt on whether Beijing would in fact adhere to that promise in a wartime setting. For instance, in August 2011 Xu Guangyu, a retired Chinese general working at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, blurted out to Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post a comment indicating Beijing had developed plans to launch “a surprise attack on the U.S.” These shocking comments, at a minimum, indicate that in the post-Cold War world the concept of nuclear deterrence is breaking down.The erosion of deterrence looks like it is working to the benefit of the Chinese. Because of China’s formidable military advantages and its willingness to escalate, there are many voices, notably Lyle Goldstein of the Naval War College and Hugh White of the Australian National University, urging American acceptance of Chinese domination of East Asia.That is the wrong conclusion.A pair of European democracies in the 1930s tried avoiding conflict with a militant state, with spectacularly bad results. Of course, the People’s Republic of China is not the Third Reich of Germany, but German territorial ambitions naturally grew in reaction to British and French timidity and Chinese ones now are expanding fast as Americans recoil at the prospect of confronting Beijing.During the Cold War, the United States maintained a far more resolute stance. Then, Washington and its allies deterred a Soviet attack in Europe when the “correlation of forces” greatly favored the Warsaw Pact, and the West in general prevented nuclear war by deterring a foe with superior conventional and nuclear arsenals. Washington convinced Moscow—and its NATO allies—that the United States was willing to go to war to defend itself and friends, thereby keeping the peace in Europe and, for the most part, elsewhere.Since the Soviet collapse, however, Americans and others think far less about deterrence and have let nuclear arsenals age. The Chinese and Russians have noticed. China is bulking up nuke stockpiles. North Korea, after making fast progress on both nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles, has made recent threats to use its most destructive weapons. Iran, a friend of both Beijing and Pyongyang, is not far from weaponizing the atom with their help. Pakistan, an early beneficiary of Beijing’s proliferation, already has a sizeable nuclear arsenal. Russia continues to threaten neighbors, particularly the three Baltic states, all of which are NATO members, and Ukraine, which is not.It looks, in short, like a new nuclear age. China's Xi pledges $60 billion in financing for Africa, AP, 9/3/2018BEIJING (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pledged $60 billion in financing for projects in Africa in the form of assistance, investment and loans, as China furthers efforts to link the continent's economic prospects to its own. Speaking to a gathering of African leaders in Beijing, Xi said the figure includes $15 billion in grants, interest-free loans and concessional loans, $20 billion in credit lines, $10 billion for ""development financing"" and $5 billion to buy imports from Africa. In addition, he said China will encourage companies to invest at least $10 billion in Africa over the next three years. China's outreach to Africa aims to build trade, investment and political ties with a continent often seen as overlooked by the U.S. and other Western nations. That has provided lucrative opportunities for Chinese businesses, while African nations are often happy to accept China's offers that come without demands for safeguards against corruption, waste and environmental damage. No details were given on specific projects, although Xi said China was planning initiatives in eight areas, including providing $147 million in emergency food aid, sending 500 agricultural experts to Africa, and providing scholarships, vocational training and trade promotion opportunities. The pledge comes on top of a 2015 promise to provide African countries with $60 billion in funding that Xi said had either been delivered or arranged.Also Monday, Xi promoted Beijing's initiative to build ports and other infrastructure as a tool for ""common prosperity"" in a world facing challenges from trade protectionism. Addressing businesspeople prior to the formal opening of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, Xi said the ""Belt and Road"" initiative will expand markets. He tried to mollify concern that Beijing wants to build strategic influence, promising Chinese investment comes with ""no political strings attached.""""Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. Economic growth lacks robust drive,"" Xi said in a speech. ""China-Africa cooperation under the BRI is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples."" African and other Asian leaders have welcomed ""Belt and Road"" but some projects have prompted complaints about debt and other problems. The initiative involves hundreds of projects, most of them built by Chinese contractors and financed by loans from Chinese state-owned banks, across an arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and the Middle East.In a major blow to China's ambitions, Malaysia recently canceled Chinese-financed projects worth more than $20 billion, saying they were unnecessary and would create an unsustainable debt burden. Deeply indebted Pakistan is also reportedly reconsidering some projects in the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that is a key link in the BRI.The Beijing forum brings together leaders from China and more than 50 African countries. Dozens of African leaders met with Xi ahead of the conference.Xi made no mention of the political and debt concerns that overshadow some BRI projects. But Chinese officials previously have rejected accusations that projects leave host countries too deeply indebted to Chinese lenders. ""China's investment in Africa comes with no political strings attached,"" Xi said. ""China does not interfere in Africa's internal affairs and does not impose its own will on Africa."" Ethnic cleansing makes a comeback — in China By Josh Rogin Columnist 8/2/2018If ethnic cleansing takes place in China and nobody is able to hear it, does it make a sound? That’s what millions of Muslims inside the People’s Republic are asking as they watch the Chinese government expand a network of internment camps and systematic human rights abuses designed to stamp out their peoples’ religion and culture.Since last year, hundreds of thousands — and perhaps millions — of innocent Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region in northwest China have been unjustly arrested and imprisoned in what the Chinese government calls “political re-education camps.” Thousands have disappeared. There are credible reports of torture and death among the prisoners. The government says it is fighting “terrorism” and “religious extremism.” Uighurs say they are resisting a campaign to crush religious and cultural freedom in China. The international community has largely reacted with silence.Horrific as they are, the camps constitute just one part of Beijing’s effort. The government has destroyed thousands of religious buildings. It has banned long beards and many Muslim names. People are forced to eat pork against their beliefs. The Chinese government’s persecution of innocents continues even after their death. Crematoria are being built to literally extinguish the Uighur funeral tradition, which insists on burials.Add to that the unprecedented security and surveillance state in Xinjiang, which includes all-encompassing monitoring based on identity cards, checkpoints, facial recognition and the collection of DNA from millions of individuals. The authorities feed all this data into an artificial-intelligence machine that rates people’s loyalty to the Communist Party in order to control every aspect of their lives. If that doesn’t bother you, consider that this draconian expansion of Chinese repression is being exported to the United States and around the world. Families of U.S. citizens who speak out against Beijing are targeted as part of Beijing’s effort to snuff out all international criticism. U.S. citizen Gulchehra Hoja, a journalist for Radio Free Asia’s Uighur service, has had more than two dozen family members in China detained in the camps, including her elderly parents and her brother, who has not been heard from since his arrest last September. Many of her RFA colleagues have similar stories.“I hope and pray for my family to be let go and released, but I know if that happens they will still live under a constant threat,” she testified last week before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. “I came to the United States to realize a dream, a dream of being able to tell the truth without fear.”Despite Beijing’s efforts, mounting evidence of the camps has managed to make its way to the outside world. Massive camp construction can be seen from satellites, and advertisements for new construction contracts are publicly available. Witnesses have told their stories. Yet the world has failed to respond. Inside the Trump administration and on Capitol Hill, that may finally be changing. At last week’s congressional hearing, Ambassador Kelley Currie, a top official at the U.S. United Nations mission, called on the Chinese government to end its repressive policies in Xinjiang and to free all those arbitrarily detained.The Chinese government is attempting to “Sinocise religion” and “transform religion and ethnicity in Chinese society” in a scheme more ambitious than Mao’s Cultural Revolution, she testified. “The scope of this campaign is breathtaking.” The U.S. government has tools to raise the pressure and costs on China, should it decide to act. Commission Chairman Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called for U.S. corporations to stop selling China items that can be used for repression, including DNA technologies and video surveillance tools. The administration can also impose sanctions on senior Chinese officials for human rights abuses under the Global Magnitsky Act. Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who honed his repression skills in Tibet and has now expanded them against Muslim minorities, is one obvious target.“We clearly know horrible things are happening here to the Uighurs. And wherever there are abuses, there are abusers,” Rubio said. “It’s working. That’s the saddest part of all.” The Chinese government’s obsession with its international reputation is its main vulnerability. Calling out these atrocities in public and to Beijing directly is key. The horror in Xinjiang is not a China issue, it’s a global issue. China uses its position on the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. Security Council not only to stifle discussion of its actions but also to attempt to rewrite international human rights norms to allow expansion of these practices by any dictatorship with the means.“The United States advances religious freedom in our foreign policy because it is not exclusively an American right,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week. “It is a God-given universal right bestowed on all of mankind.” Those words mean little if the United States continues to stand by while the situation in Xinjiang worsens. We may choose to look away, but we can never say again we didn’t know. Mr. President, we need you to take another shot at working with business owners across the country, not just big business. Small businesses need to see a new face on capitalism, one that is not ruthless or cutthroat. Much of your deregulation has been a good thing, but deregulating utilities so they can work inside people’s homes is going to put thousands of companies out of business and will create terribly powerful monopolies in home repair. You need a new chief of staff and you need someone that thinks like you do, and I think that person is the Minority Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. I have no idea if he would be interested in giving up that position to be chief of staff or whether he would even have to, but I do know that he is interested in working with company owners to get manufacturing to return stateside and this is what the country needs most of all. Even if it is a 99% robotic labor force, it will take a huge human labor force to put it into place and there will be a huge plus side for all people in the form of higher quality and lower prices when it is up and running. As a matter of national security, we need you to get the full story of what the Google CEO Sundar Pichai, head of one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence companies did for China’s AI. If there is any truth to the rumor that Charlie Mungor started about China harvesting newborn babies brains to use in AI computers, the world needs to know all about it.Here are some more specifics laced throughout the following article on the demands we need brought to the attention of our elected officials to urge them to assist President Donald Trump through bi-partisan support to get our economy and our country back on the right track. If you haven’t gotten to read the full document, it is probably because your local county government no longer believes that the American people should be allowed the opportunity to weigh the issues presented here so you will be able to draw your own conclusions. Analysis: China is playing the long game against TrumpJulia Horowitz - CNN - Tuesday, May 22, 2018 China knows what it's doing in negotiations with President Donald Trump on trade. In recent months, Beijing has shown a willingness to make concessions. It's lowering tariffs on auto imports. It's opening its financial markets to foreign lenders. And it will start allowing US automakers to make cars in the country without local business partners. But as notable as those changes are, China is standing firm on big issues. It's plowing ahead with its plan to dominate tech, including artificial intelligence. At the same time, China is pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects in Asia, Africa and Europe — buying years of goodwill and geopolitical influence. What has happened to America’s competitive spirit? Why try to stop them when they are finally doing good things for the world? We must compete with them by welcoming immigrants and refugees from Central America and around the world to assist us in re-entering manufacturing with the highest level of efficiency in every sound vacant building in every county across the country. We can do this people this is who we are, but we will need a lot of help, and we will have to take some risks to accept that help in as controlled a manner as possible. Who would you rather have released into your county wearing home confinement gear enhanced by Third-Eye tech being directly monitored by your local sheriff’s department? The seven million American citizens languishing in prison or non-citizens? In the nineties the public was in an uproar because two million people were in the US prison system, now there are seven million and nobody cares. Most of whom were unwitting accomplices waiting in the car and all of whom are far more tame now after sitting in prison.Trump, meanwhile, focuses on the trade deficit. But economists say that fixation is misplaced. China will continue to be a giant producer on the global stage, while the US economy is driven by consumer spending. It would take enormous long-term guarantees to alter the trade imbalance in a meaningful way — not just increases to agriculture and energy exports, which China pledged over the weekend. ""This is China humoring the US,"" said Phil Levy, senior fellow on the global economy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. On Tuesday, the Chinese Finance Ministry said China will cut import duties on passenger vehicles from 25% to 15% starting on July 1. It's a flashy move that would let the United States claim a win. President Trump singled out China's tariffs on cars for criticism last month, pointing out that they're far higher than the 2.5% import duty on autos levied by the United States. ""Does that sound like free or fair trade?"" No sir, it doesn’t, but at the moment we must face the fact that we are heavily dependent on China for many, many different products and it is absolutely necessary at this time that we handle this in a way that does not single out China but sets the import tariff on all imports at 15%. Isn’t it to our advantage that they have agreed to lower they’re import tariff to 15%? How can they complain if ours is the same 15% across the board on all products no matter where they come from? Trump tweeted. ""No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!"" Your absolutely right, it is stupid trade, but it is all the results of a much bigger problem with China. In order to deal with this much bigger problem, we need our elected officials to be able to begin releasing themselves from the excessive influence of the intelligence community.The easing of import duties isn't the only move China has made recently to show that it's willing to liberalize its economy. The Chinese government has also promised to remove restrictions on foreign carmakers that want to manufacture vehicles in the country. Previously, companies such as GM and Volkswagen had to form joint ventures with local partners in which the Chinese companies have the controlling stake. China said last month it will phase out those rules by 2022. This is all strictly pretense, what does China have to lose by removing these restrictions to lure more fools into its web of deceit when, in the end it still owns everything on its own soil. This just provides China more access to bringing more foreigners under its control. And Beijing is working to lift restrictions on foreign access to the country's banking, securities, insurance and asset-management markets, with changes expected by the end of June.Such shifts benefit China on two fronts, according to Levy. They temporarily appease the United States, and they make it look like China is taking steps to become a team player on global trade, he said. At the same time, China remains full speed ahead on its state-directed push to dominate high tech fields from electric cars to 5G wireless technology. ""The US is not going to change China's approach to technology policy,"" said Samm Sacks, senior fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They certainly are not going to do it from any unilateral US action."" Beijing is also expanding its global clout by investing in ports, rail lines and other development projects through its Belt and Road initiative. These plays for global dominance could position China as a much bigger threat to US hegemony  down the road. If we are going to win this, we must compete . “Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.” - George Washington – These words of George Washington are absolutely still true today. Our biggest problem is that our intelligence community does not believe in democracy and they will not promote it. We must get our own house in order quickly and re-enter manufacturing in small businesses in every sound existing building across the country using the highest sophistication of robotics available.  The Chinese government knows that Trump remains laser focused on two big issues: North Korea and the trade deficit. Trump has made it clear that he wants a potential summit with North Korea. Additionally, the president's emphasis on the trade imbalance has allowed China to provide the United States with nominal victories by making commitments to purchase more goods.Even on this, experts are skeptical. Global saving and spending patterns are fairly entrenched, making bilateral trade deficits difficult to manipulate. ""If your metric is the US deficit on trade with China, the programs that have been unveiled so far are not going to decrease it significantly,"" said Nicholas Lardy, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and expert on the Chinese economy. ""It may prevent it from increasing further."" “Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all.”                       - George Washington – “We must live together as brothers or perish together as fools."" – Martin Luther King –“Our defense is in the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere."" - Abraham Lincoln-We are at a crossroads, the choice we make of which road we take, there will be no returning to take the other path. This is the path to freedom, the choice is easy, doing nothing is the wrong choice. James Comey will realize too late that his “Higher Loyalty” to China is not reciprocated. Here, in the United States of America, we have two opposing forces, the Alt-Right and the Hardcore Left, both of which display astonishing levels of intelligence and egregious depths of stupid at the same time. These are sure and certain signs that both sides are deeply compromised by programming. Both want us to believe they can lead the United States to a better future, but both sides are taking us down into the depths of debt while robbing the middle-class of its wealth. The Alt-Right believes they can build up the military, fix our elections, control our supreme court, undermine our government and bring a dictator to power and always stay ahead of china with better weaponry, putting themselves, the UK and Israel and the banking system of the West into an utterly ruthless global business partnership with China and Russia and the countries that the UK led into Parliamentary governments that were right at China’s door and easy picking for China with its infiltration skills and when one of these countries proved to be more of a challenge, the UK with the help of the CIA stepped in. 1953 Iranian coup d'état From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d'état was the overthrow of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name ""Operation Boot"") and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project[5] or ""Operation Ajax""), and the first United States covert action to overthrow a foreign government during peacetime.Mosaddegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now part of BP) and to limit the company's control over Iranian oil reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Judging Mosaddegh to be unreliable and fearing a Communist takeover in Iran, UK prime minister Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement would set. British intelligence officials′ conclusions and the UK government's solicitations were instrumental in initiating and planning the coup, despite the fact that the U.S. government in 1952 had been considering unilateral action (without UK support) to assist the Mosaddegh government.Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king), to rule more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power. According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on 19 August. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks and took over the streets of the city. Between 200 and 300 people were killed because of the conflict. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life. Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty. After the coup, the Shah continued his rule as monarch for the next 26 years until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.In August 2013, sixty years afterward, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the U.S. role in the coup by releasing a bulk of previously classified government documents that show it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda. The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out ""under CIA direction"" and ""as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government"". The Right has kept us in the game to this point because, although the Alt-Right shows incredible depths of stupid by denying climate change, supporting racism, and fighting all forms of reasonable gun-control, they are the ones who have kept our military strong. When the Right or the Left speaks out against anti-Zionism and holds out that it is antisemitism it is not correct. When American Nazis went underground as evangelists, they began espousing the literal interpretation of the Bible and Zionists are guilty of having done the same thing to Judaism. In both cases the idea that the writings were intended to be taken literal is ridiculous and in both cases the interpretation is the result of China’s influence. Let’s just consider the story of Noah’s Ark, the main moral of this story is simply that if you have a captive animal of a sort, you should also have another animal of the same sort, so the animal is not lonely. What the right does not get, is that the guidance they have been getting from Zionists comes from the same banking segment of the Illuminati Jews that were infiltrated and corrupted by Chinese dupes in the nineteenth century who were then scapegoated to arouse a general public hate of all Jews in Germany and Russia in preparation for Jewish genocide during WWII. It is this illuminati banking segment of Jews that were infiltrated and corrupted by the Chinese that promote Zionism. When people point out that most of the Founding Fathers were Masons and therefore Illuminati for a New World Order this is not correct because the Illuminati Jews had only just begun to be infiltrated by the Chinese at that time. It is this complexity of China’s influence that has been such a great benefit to them throughout history, but it is their arrogance that causes their failure to have any respect for lessons learned that simplifies the problem of understanding the truth about history and the source of all corruption in the world. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaAnti-Zionism is opposition to Zionism. The term is broadly defined in the modern era to denote opposition to the political movement of Jews to self-determination within the territory of the historic Land of Israel (also referred to as Palestine, Canaan, or the Holy Land). Anti-Zionism is also defined as opposition to the State of Israel or, prior to 1948, its establishment. The term is used to describe various religious, moral and political points of view, but their diversity of motivation and expression is sufficiently different that ""anti-Zionism"" cannot be seen as having a single ideology or source. There is also a difference between how it is discussed philosophically and how it is enacted within a political or social campaign.[2] Many notable Jewish and non-Jewish sources take the view that anti-Zionism has become a cover for modern-day antisemitism, a position that critics have challenged as a tactic to silence criticism of Israeli policies. Others, such as Steven M. Cohen, Brian Klug and Todd Gitlin, see no correlation between the two. Zionism and Judaism are Extreme Opposites:Jewish anti-Zionism is as old as Zionism itself, and enjoyed widespread support in the Jewish community until World War II.[5] The Jewish community is not a single united group and responses vary both among and within Jewish groups. One of the principal divisions is that between secular Jews and religious Jews. The reasons for secular opposition to the Zionist movement are very different from those of religious Jews. Opposition to a Jewish state has changed over time and has taken on a diverse spectrum of religious, ethical and political positions. The legitimacy of anti-Zionist views has been disputed to the present day, including the more recent and disputed relationship between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. Other views regarding the various forms of anti-Zionism have also been discussed and debated.  Before 1948There is a long tradition of Jewish anti-Zionism that has opposed the Zionist project from its origins. The Bundists, the Autonomists, Reform Judaism and the Agude regarded both the rationale and territorial ambitions of Zionism as flawed. Orthodox Judaism, which grounds civic responsibilities and patriotic feelings in religion, was strongly opposed to Zionism because, though the two shared the same values, Zionism espoused nationalism in secular fashion, and used ""Zion"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Land of Israel"", ""redemption"" and ""ingathering of exiles"" as literal rather than sacred terms, endeavouring to achieve them in this world.[10] Orthodox Jews also opposed the creation of a Jewish state prior to the appearance of the messiah, as contradicting divine will.[11] By contrast, reform Jews rejected Judaism as a national or ethnic identity, and renounced any messianic expectations of the advent of a Jewish state.[12]PalestiniansFounded in 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is an umbrella organization for groups that represent the Palestinian people before international states.[64] The Palestinian National Authority, officially established in 1994 as a result of the Oslo Accords, is an interim administrative body nominally responsible for governance in Palestinian population centers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since 1978, the United Nations has observed an annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. According to Perry Anderson, it is estimated that half of the population in the Palestinian territories are refugees and that they have collectively suffered approximately US$300 billion in property losses due to Israeli confiscations, at 2008–09 prices.While abortion is wrong, children that are abused, abandoned or end up starving to death is worse. Over population of the earth is a fast-approaching problem that AI-Tech is not going to be able to satisfy. The safest most effective solution is reversable neutering for all children born everywhere so that abortion is no longer an issue and children are not being born where the whole population is already starving to death which is a world crisis today and will only get much, much worse if we do not make reversible neutering at birth US law to prove that we advocate this practice for ourselves and not just for poorer countries. Then we can call on the rest of the members to make it the law of the World Health Organization right away. The Alt-Right has kept us ahead of China with cutting edge stealth, communications and weapons technology by funding the military, but this has been mainly a joint achievement by the right and the left because the military has been able to take advantage of the advancements the passivist left have made. The Hardcore Left says that they believe that China is not really a threat and we should unilaterally disarm and open our borders to free and easy movement of the labor force so the global economy can flourish, and the world will be a wonderful place just by supporting free and fair elections here and sharing all of our technology with China. The worst problem with programming is people are programmed to espouse things they don’t believe themselves and despite the fact that they don’t believe the words coming out of their own mouths, the more they are challenged, the more vehemently they argue the point.  They are duped by China into espousing zealously, not believing that China will see that democracy is good and they will decide to allow their people to vote but saying it whether they believe it or not. This is an absurdly stupid assumption that is not supported by anything that China has ever done in the past. The left has shown great brilliance in advancing the technology that the right uses to keep us ahead of China but both the left and the right are now leading us inexorably toward the level of disastrous debt and world population growth in the face of China’s advancing military capability that will allow China to become the global authority. The result of this will be a global catastrophe the likes of which the world has only experienced on a much smaller scale. The movie “The Killing Fields” that depicts the Chinese backed communists Khmer Rouge as it mows down Cambodia is the best movie rendition of what will happen to the entire world. If China is allowed to continue to deceive nations into believing that they are now benevolent and warmhearted providers of advanced technology with no strings attached the future is worse than grim for the people of  China and the rest of the world. We are right to discourage countries from accepting China’s largesse, but unless we offer them an alternative, they are going let China in because they need the things China is offering and, as Dambisa Moyo points out, feeding people today is more important than achieving any other goal. Many may believe that they will simply pay their debt to China and go on to become a prosperous and free democracy when China is done. This is nearly as absurd as believing that the US can disarm, and the world will be a better place. The reason the world did not become a better place while the US was far ahead in the arms race is because the US unwittingly let China gain a great deal of influence in our society and our government when it first let the Hardcore Left FBI operate in secrecy and then let the Alt-Right CIA operate in secrecy. This led to 15 other secret agencies and most of the rest of the unelected federal employees into keeping information from our elected officials which has allowed these unelected interlopers to gather compromising information on our elected officials rendering them helpless puppets with China pulling the strings. China is incredibly deceptive and skilled at controlling other countries from within, secrecy and centralization are its greatest allies. They were being incredibly deceptive when they sold the world on the idea that they were totally against western capitalism during Mao’s cultural revolution while influencing the US to buy into a more ruthless form of capitalism, the beginning stages of globalization, that systematically robbed small farmers of their land, many of them, 160 acre land grants from the federal government, and selling them to non-citizen absentee land owners that are mostly descendants of British royalty that have never made any effort to become US citizens. Knowing what we know now, it should be self-evident that it was China’s hand of secrecy that brought about the malls that destroyed small businesses and the small towns that the small businesses supported. What should be most telling is how often that once a small community transitioned to depending on a single type of gas station, rather than taking advantage of this monopoly opportunity as one might imagine was their goal all along, instead they pulled out altogether, leaving the town to die or travel a great distance for fuel.This ruthless capitalism, we now know, led us to fewer and larger farms and fewer and larger businesses as well as purchasing more and more cheap goods that were made in China. All of which has, not surprisingly, played right into the hands of China. In the eighties when China showed the world that it could embrace western capitalism and globalization in complete conflict with the theme of the cultural revolution less than a decade in the past, it should have been a red flag to our intelligence community from the start. When China later began inviting US manufacturers to take advantage of their cheap labor under very strict conditions our leaders should have been warned by the FBI, the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community that China was fast gaining power and that greater care was needed to protect our most advanced technology. This should have been clearly evident by the start of the new millennium but what is clearly evident now is that our intelligence community was simply ignoring it, much like they ignored and denied the existence of organized crime for so long. That our intelligence community only now, when they are under tremendous pressure for their continued existence, do they begin to warn of the threat that China has become is evidence of their duplicity. It’s not only that the effort is so late but that they are actually getting assistance from China in making their case that makes the truth so clear. Mr. President, you would probably never hear it from our 81 billion dollars per year intelligence community, but China has been in an arms race with the US for quite a while now. China believes they can offer less restrictive conditions to continue gaining control of manufacturing and stealing patents. China is confident that they will be the most powerful country on earth when over population throughs the rest of the world into total chaos. Then China will solve the over-population problem and the rest of the world’s problems by turning the world into “The Killing Fields” while executing a cultural revolution that fills the world with re-education camps that allows no form of religion to exist.Mr. President, the only way to defeat China is to get the people of the world back on our side by restoring democracy in Venezuela and the rest of Central and South America while pressuring Russia and Turkey to re-embrace democracy. While we must take a whole world approach to this problem, we cannot continue to be spread as thin as we currently are, and we cannot continue to sink deeper into debt. The clear intent of the intelligence community is to leave a vacuum in Iraq and Afghanistan and blame you for it. We must not let this happen and we must not continue to be spread so thin. We must concentrate our power, most of all, right here in the United States of America, mainly along our southern border but also along our northern border. We must recognize that providence alone has put us in control of two key strategic locations between China and Russia at a time when China can least afford to trust Russia. Both Russia and China are facing pressure from within and the fact that Putin has usurped the democratic power that was established in Russia gives us greater leverage with Russia than we have ever had. If the intelligence community and the Alt-Right are allowed to continue undermining our democracy it will prostrate us at the mercy of China, where no mercy exists. We have to bolster every aspect of our democracy, primarily making the distinction between what is constitutional and what is not, but not exclusively on this basis. The free press is clearly a constitutional mandate and therefore must be supported with alacrity. Agencies that keep secrets from our elected officials are in no way supported by our constitution and when they undertake to infiltrate the free press, they are presenting a clear and present danger to national security, not protecting it and they must be stopped. Secret agencies and federal government secrecy must be ended in one fell swoop if we are to be able to enter the arms race with China and keep our cutting-edge technology from being stolen by them or handed over to them. Whatever technology has been manufactured in China they have it now and that is a simple fact. They will make any promises they feel are necessary be able to keep corporations bringing our technology to them so they can steel it because they know if it is being manufactured in China, they can steel it and there is nothing we can do about it and that is a simple fact. They know, and we know that there is no way for us to force them to abide by any promise they make or to verify any compliance and that is a simple fact. The corporations that are headquartered in the US, that are manufacturing in China must be strongly encouraged get out, get your people out and return to the US to make a stand on all of the ways stolen from you. They may never get anything from China that they believe China owes them, they may have to accept that, but if they help restore manufacturing to the US, we should offer them assistance on the county, state and federal level to produce their products with the highest quality robotics available so that labor is hardly a factor. We must also offer them greater assurances that if they do R&D the patents they acquire will be as well protected the US federal government can provide to them. China has committed acts of aggression that, for all practical purposes amounts to a declaration of war against the US and we are behind the eight ball now, due to the fact too much of our manufacturing is done by China now. In 1939 President Roosevelt was able to harness our massive manufacturing capabilities in preparation for the war. We don’t have that option. Having said that, Mr. President, it would still be wise to have a few aides begin researching the steps Mr. Roosevelt took to get Congress and manufacturers on board that resulted in our being the powerhouse that we became in such a short time because this is what is required of us now in order to be able to deal with China from a position of strength. Fortunately, this is not 1939 and we do not have to ramp-up production of the same kind that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proved to be so very capable of. I suggest that we concentrate almost exclusively on drones for deployment in the air, on the land, on the sea, under the sea, and in space. What we must do is develop a whole new approach to drones that are more benign yet, no less effective at disarming the enemy than smart bombs are. This sort of weaponry will be more acceptable to big tech than bombs and their help is essential. What I am talking about are large spider type of drones that can electromagnetically latch onto any steel object, whose appendages are screwdrivers drills and plasma torches that can secure itself to any non-steel object. We should have contingency plans for every weapon in China’s arsenal starting with the military-run space station in Argentina. What I am talking about is flying these spiders in on drones, deploying them as close as possible and sending them in to disassemble strategic parts using the plasma torch to quickly cut away the area around attachment bolts so they cannot easily replace them and ferret away multiple parts of the 16-story antenna at the same time, effectively putting it out of commission. We hope to never have the need of such an attack as this, but we must have the plans and the capability. This same scenario should be used to manufacture drones that can disable satellites and submarines, while not damaging them beyond repair. Satellites are too far away to repair quickly and too expensive to destroy and we don’t want to add to the space debris at any rate. Submarines will be able to detect the sound of drills and torches but are they prepared to stop such an attack before multiple bulkheads are flooding and they are forced to surface. What we want to do is to be as fair and conciliatory with China for as long as we can so that we can restore our reputation in the world by restoring as many democracies as possible so we can become as strong as we can by consolidating our power before China decides that it must show us that it is willing use its military. This is what we must do, in order to be prepared to launch a counterattack that they will have no answer for. First and foremost, we must develop systems that can disarm nuclear missiles in flight, attaching to them early before they gain speed with large numbers of drones and if we cannot prevent the nukes from exploding, and this must be determined quickly enough to bring it down on China, N. Korea, Pakistan, Iran or Russia or whatever country it originated from so that they quickly decide to cease fire. If this fails, we must be prepared to attack it with hundreds of laser equipped drones to set it off in flight as close to launch as possible to convince them to abort the attack. Now that the National Emergency has been declared you need to call a meeting with the four leaders in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to discuss the dire national security crisis facing the nation from China as a result of the failure of the $81 billion/year intelligence community. Explain to them that it is imperative that the United States of America take a new approach in world affairs, one that relies entirely on overt security and makes secrecy of any kind strictly against the law, with one and only exception, and that is when it pertains to cutting edge technology. This new approach will include democratic nation building with three minimum requirements: First; All government representatives including the executive must be elected by the people in free and fair elections. Second; Secrecy of any kind must be unconstitutional. Third, religious freedom based on the strict separation of church and state must be an explicit part of the humanitarian bill of rights. Explain that you will not be doing any more campaigning so that you can focus your full attention on restoring democracy in the Western Hemisphere; Venezuela, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Brazil and Cuba. Explain that you will be giving explicit orders to Vice President Mike Pence to begin working with Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan to hold free and fair elections in Russia and Turkey, making it clear they have acted similarly to Maduro. Furthermore, Jarod Kushner will be given explicit orders to deliver the message from the POTUS for Israel and Saudi Arabia to end military engagements and bring their troops home and assist the US in delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen so they can begin rebuilding their infrastructure and fulfill their goals of democracy. Tell the leaders of Congress that you need them to gather Congressional support for a modern military build-up along the lines that occurred under the leadership of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in preparation for WWII. To assure that humanitarian aid piling up for Venezuela is not stolen or destroyed by Maduro and a lot of innocent lives are not lost in the process, you need to ask Congress to support the use of the military as a peace keeping force, to escort the supplies to distribution points across the country. Inform the leaders Congress that you be positioning three aircraft carriers in the Caribbean as a deterrent to China or Russia becoming involved and to intimidate Maduro from doing anything stupid.It is wrong to call the newly elected democrats socialists and it is not what you need to be doing at this time. Now you are drawing fire for promoting socialism for the rich. You won’t like it, and you won’t agree with it, but they make a strong case. You’ll be needing another chief of staff when Mick Mulvaney leaves, and you need to get someone you trust. The most important first step in all of this is getting people into “Third-Eye Tech” and getting feedback on their experience using it to free themselves. I suggest that you get Chris Christie to begin trying out this technology, the technology already exists. Governor Christie is very skilled at getting bipartisan support and that is what you need in a chief of staff. I’m sure, after reading Mr. Christie’s book, “Let Me Finish” that he is smart enough to know that if you are able to get humanitarian aid to the people of  Venezuela and truly restore democracy in that country that you will win in 2020 by a landslide without campaigning at all. You need to apologize for your divisive language in Florida and assure the leaders in Congress that it will not happen again because you will not be returning to the campaign trail. The GND gets way out there, but you should just view it as the using advice in “The Art of the Deal” by asking for much more than they expect, so they have things to jettison and still get what they want. Going “Green” gives us tremendous leverage in competing with China in the future and it will not end the use of cars and planes. Electric cars are still cars and jets that use hydrogen fuel are still jets. Our military will always be important even if we get Xi and the communist party of China to use “Third-Eye Tech” and they free themselves from programming. The world must always be prepared to face an outside threat, that will never change. What must change is the programming in our own society that makes people say that sex between two men is normal when there is no-way anyone can actually believe that. But we must address the programming that makes people say that climate change doesn’t exist and that it is some vast left-wing conspiracy by scientists that has gone on for a hundred years. These views are as ridiculous as unilateral disarmament and racism. As seems to be a recurring theme, I am running out of time to get this out there in hopes the president will read it and realize that he needs to get behind this and push for it. The Presidents first step in the National Emergency should be to get a copy of this to the leaders of Congress so that when he meets with them, they will be well informed of the need to get the military in “Third-Eye Tech”, to begin getting feedback on its effectiveness. The President needs to give the military orders enlist all federal employees that show up to join when they are fired so they can be issued basic “Third-Eye Tech” and sent to the border to live in tent cities along with the refugees arriving from Central America. These federal employees should be assigned the task of interviewing refugees to get their point of view on what is causing the problems in Guatemala and Honduras on video tape. This will expose the CIA and the FBI as the source of the problem in these countries and the reason the US is not trusted to help. This attitude must be ignored if we are to restore our reputation by restoring democracy around the world. China is the world’s enemy and by restoring democracy in Russia and Turkey we can begin isolate China. There is much to be done in order to restore our reputation in the world. There is much more that needs to be addressed and my work will continue. Trump Serves Americans By Condemning Venezuela’s MaduroRobert Wasinger - The Daily Caller - Tuesday, February 19, 2019President Trump delivered a damning warning to Venezuela’s military in his Monday speech: drop Nicolas Maduro or lose everything. Trump’s tough talk has followed decisive action as the president deploys sanctions and other economic measures to send Maduro packing. Despite this strong posture, the administration’s critics have argued total withdrawal from America’s global commitments.Don’t let these attacks confuse you. President Trump is restoring a much-needed dose of sanity to our foreign policy. The interests of average Americans are once again being put first in lieu of the global and political elite. To be clear, this shift in priorities is precisely why the president has met such resistance within the U.S. foreign policy community. Establishment-backed nonprofits and international institutions like the United Nations have  advocated for a foreign policy that benefits the few over the many.These policies led to disaster.Botched occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan which sacrificed countless lives and trillions of dollars in treasure. President Obama’s Nuclear Deal which sent hundreds of billions back to the radical Islamist regime in Iran and threw the Middle East into turmoil. And empowered China both economically and militarily at the expense of our traditional allies in Asia. Despite these shortcomings, the establishment of both political parties was happy to stay the course. In an attempt to defend this outdated agenda, critics have reeled against President Trump’s “America first” agenda by labeling him an isolationist. And yet, President Trump’s actions have thrown that accusation on its face. Stringent sanctions have been placed back on the Iranian regime and Tehran’s radical Islamist proxies are being confronted across the Middle East. ISIS has lost nearly 98 percent of its territory mostly since the president took office.The Trump administration has also dramatically increased the number of freedom-of-navigation patrols in the South China Sea and hounded Beijing for its unfair trading practices. Don’t forget; Russia hasn’t gotten off easy either. President Trump upended Obama’s ban on lethal weapons to Ukraine by selling high-powered snipers and Javelin rockets and increased non-lethal aid to Kiev. Rather than recognize these victories, the establishment has worked to paint President Trump as favoring America in retreat. Funny enough, his critics have tried to color him on the other side of the spectrum in regard to Venezuela. Now, President Trump is no longer an isolationist, but a neoconservative warmonger working to remove the innocent Maduro from power. Clearly, this is not the case. Several things should be pointed out to help folks better understand the underlying American interests that are represented by disposing of the horrible Maduro regime.First, the economic and social chaos of the Maduro government is a dramatic rebuke to the socialist fever dreams of the American left. A nation rich in natural resources has been turned into an economic and political basket case with millions of refugees fleeing Maduro’s socialist paradise. Paging Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The Venezuelan people have seen your future and it does not work. The cognitive dissonance of the left is always shocking; but seldom as much so as in this case. In fact, it’s unsurprising, that some American progressives are embracing a leader who practices what they preach. Furthermore, it is clear that a Venezuela in turmoil isn’t in the interest of the U.S. or its allies in the region. America is already hosting more than 300,000 Venezuelans immigrants who have fled due to Maduro’s left-wing policies.Worse, Colombia, an important U.S. ally in the region, may host as many as four million Venezuelan refugees by 2021 if the situation is not under control. Overwhelming Colombia with migrants would only hinder America’s ability to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking operations. Brazil is also experiencing its own woes due to the situation in Venezuela. Venezuela’s regime is also no friend to the American people. Maduro allows his country to host members of the radical Islamist terrorist organization Hezbollah, the group responsible for killing hundreds of American soldiers in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.Still, the resistance and criticism you hear in the media can be expected to persist as long as Trump continues to place the interests of the American people before those of the establishment and global elite. Because they believe that they know better than the American people who elected a president to put their interests first.Robert Wasinger (@RobertWasinger) served in senior advisory and liaison roles on President Trump’s campaign and transition team. The Daily Caller. Quote from interview with Garry Kasparov. “How well thought-out do you think this strategy was here?At first, they were using Trump mostly as an icebreaker. They expected Hillary to win and wanted to discredit her completely. Trump was the perfect vehicle for discrediting not only Hillary but the entire electoral system. Putin’s great advantage is that, unlike Soviet propagandists, he is not selling an ideology. I call him the merchant of doubt. His message is; We are shit, you are shit, and all of this is bullshit. What democracy? Trump was the ideal agent of chaos.Trump kept saying that the election will be rigged. This was the Kremlin line. I think their main script was that Hillary would win in a close battle and #ElectionIsRigged would be a hashtag that would discredit her. She would be paralyzed. She’d be facing a Republican congress, which would immediately begin impeachment proceedings.”             Transcript: Sen. Lindsey Graham on ""Face the Nation,""  CBS News 2/17/2019 MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to ""Face the Nation."" We have a lot to get to today and we're going to begin with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. He joins us from Germany where he is attending the Munich Security Conference. Sir I want to get right to this conversation my colleague Scott Pelley had on ""60 Minutes"" with former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe where he described a conversation about the 25th Amendment-- the mechanism through which to push the president out of office- And he said it was brought up to him by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. MCCABE: Discussion of the 25th amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.PELLEY: Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the president.MCCABE: That's correct. Counting votes or possible votes.PELLEY: What seemed to be coursing through the mind of the deputy attorney general? Was it, getting rid of the president of the united states?MCCABE: well--PELLEY: --One way or another.MCCABE: I can't confirm that. But what I can say is the deputy attorney general was definitely very concerned about the president, about his capacity and about his intent at that point in time.PELLEY: How did he bring up the idea of the 25th amendment to you?MCCABE: Honestly, I don't remember. He-- it was just another kind of topic that he jumped to in the midst of a wide-ranging conversation.PELLEY: Seriously? (laugh) just--MCCABE: --yeah--PELLEY: --another topic?MCCABE: yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator that's a tremendous allegation to make. Have you ever asked Rod Rosenstein if in fact that conversation happened?SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, he's publicly denied it, but, the whole point of Congress existing is to provide oversight of the executive branch. So, through good reporting by ""60 Minutes,"" there's an allegation by the acting FBI director at the time that the deputy attorney general was basically trying to do an administrative coup, take the president down through the twenty fifth amendment process. The deputy attorney general denies it. So, I promise your viewers the following; that we will have a hearing about who's telling the truth, what actually happened. Mr. McCabe, you remember, was dismissed from the FBI for leaking information to the press. So, you've got to remember the source here.MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been some parsing though of whether these were extended discussions versus conversations about the 25th Amendment. Do you know whether those conversations have taken place?SEN. GRAHAM: No but I think everybody in the country needs to know if it happened. It's stunning to me that one of the chief law enforcement officers of the land- the acting head of the FBI- would go on national television and say, oh by the way I remember a conversation with the deputy attorney general about trying to find if we could replace the president under the 25th Amendment. We're a democracy. People who enforce the law- can't take it into their own hands. Was this an attempted bureaucratic coup? I don't know. I don't know who's telling the truth. I know Rosenstein vehemently denied it but we're going to get to the bottom of it. I do know there was a lot of monkey business about FISA warrants being issued against Carter Page, about dossiers coming from Russia that were unverified. Mr. Mueller is going to look at the Trump campaign as he should to see if they violated any laws during the 2016 election. And I'm going to do everything I can to get to the bottom of the Department of Justice FBI behavior toward President Trump and his campaign.MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but by even framing it as you just did there, Senator, are you concerned that by investigating the investigators you are adding to some damage of the credibility of the FBI?SEN. GRAHAM:  Quite the opposite. If it happened, we need to clean it up. The FBI has gotten off track in the past. It's one of the greatest organizations in the world. The Hoover years have proven to be pretty dark periods for the FBI. The latter part of the Hoover days where politicians were being blackmailed. There is no organization beyond scrutiny. There is no organization that can't withstand scrutiny. And the FBI will come out stronger. But we've got to get to the bottom of it. What are people to think after they watch ""60 Minutes"" when they hear this accusation by the acting FBI director that the deputy attorney general encouraged him to try to find ways to count votes to replace the president? That can't go unaddressed. And it will be addressed. That's what oversight is all about.MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you subpoena McCabe and Rosenstein to appear?SEN. GRAHAM: How can I not, if that's what it takes? I mean you're doing your job. The first amendment allows you to ask questions of the most powerful people in the country. I know he's selling a book, and we need to take with a grain of salt maybe what Mr. McCabe is telling us. But he went on national television and he made an accusation that floors me. You know, I can imagine if the shoe were on the other foot, this would- if we were talking about getting rid of President Clinton, it'd be front page news all over the world. Well we're going to find out what happened here and the only way I know to find out is to call the people in under oath and find out, through questioning, who's telling the truth because the underlying accusation is beyond stunning.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to play another clip from that interview for you. SCOTT PELLEY: What was it specifically that caused you to launch the counterintelligence investigation?ANDREW MCCABE: It's many of those same concerns that caused us to be concerned about a national security threat. And the idea is if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the FBI to negatively impact, or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity, and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, why would a president of the United States do that? So, all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder, is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia? MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, you voiced support for the Mueller probe in the past. Listening to—SEN. GRAHAM: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: What McCabe just described there- a troubling pattern of behavior that he, as a lifetime investigator saw as a troubling fact pattern, led him to open a counterintelligence investigation into the president of the United States. Can you understand why he came to that conclusion?SEN. GRAHAM: I can understand that the American people will get an answer to the question from Mr. Mueller. What I can't understand is why Mr. McCabe would meet with Page and Strzok to discuss their hatred for candidate Trump, talking about taking an insurance policy out in case the election went different than they want. So, Mueller will tell us about what Trump did or didn't do. I'm going to tell the country about McCabe and the people at the Department of Justice and how they behaved. Did they take the law into their own hands? Did they abuse the FISA warrant process because they had a political agenda? Did their hatred of Trump go so far, that they abandoned their role of being law enforcement agents and became advocates for a political cause? We're going to get to the bottom of that.MARGARET BRENNAN: But you recognize there that McCabe is laying out the grounds of what he saw as an obstruction of justice attempt.SEN. GRAHAM: Mr. Mueller will look at that, but I think McCabe, Strzok and Page had a political bias, a political agenda. And I find it odd that the dossier that they use to get the warrant against Carter Page, prepared by a foreign agent, paid for by the Democratic Party that they knew to be unreliable, was used on four separate occasions to get a warrant. And I want to know why Comey told the president, ""Here's the dossier. We've got it. We can't verify any of it. We want you to know about it."" And that same document was used by the FBI and the Department of Justice under oath to tell the court, ""This is reliable information, gives us a warrant based on this document. I hope your viewers understand that the rule of law works both ways. Somebody has got to watch those who watch us, and I intend to watch what McCabe and- and his crowd did during the 2016 election.MARGARET BRENNAN: The president just declared a national emergency in regard to getting the funds for his border wall. In terms of getting those funds through this emergency action and there's about three point six billion of it that could come from military construction efforts, including construction of a middle school in Kentucky, housing for military families, improvements for bases like Camp Pendleton and Hanscom Air Force Base. Aren't you concerned that some of these projects that were part of legislation that you helped approve and Congress are now going to possibly be cut out?SEN. GRAHAM: Well the president will have to make a decision where to get the money. Let's just say for a moment that he took some money out of the military construction budget. I would say it's better for the middle school kids in Kentucky to have a secure border. We'll get them the school they need. But right now, we've got a national emergency on our hands. Opioid addiction is going through the roof in this country. Thousands of Americans died last year and dying this year because we can't control the flow of drugs into this country and all of its coming across the border--MARGARET BRENNAN: Through ports of entry according to the--SEN. GRAHAM: So, the dangers presented by a broken border to me.MARGARET BRENNAN: --to Customs and Border patrol though. But--SEN. GRAHAM: Both. It's both. It's not just one. For everyone we get, God knows how much we miss.MARGARET BRENNAN: Don't you think Congress has ceded too much power to the executive branch?  Do you think that you need to more sharply define what constitutes a national emergency so that future presidents can't interpret it as they like?SEN. GRAHAM: Good question. I think that every member of Congress has watched three presidents send troops to the border. Bush, Obama, now Trump. Not one of us have complained about deploying forces to the border to secure the border. It's pretty hard for me to understand the legal difference between sending troops and having them build a barrier. What disappoints me is on President Obama's watch as a Republican, I voted for a 44 billion-dollar border security package, 9 billion of which included barriers. 2006 all of us voted for the Secure-Fence Act. And we're talking about steel barriers not a concrete wall. And unfortunately, when it comes to Trump, the Congress is locked down and will not give him what we've given past presidents. So unfortunately, he's got to do it on his own and I support his decision to go that route.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well perhaps in the future we can talk about sharpening what constitutes an emergency. But before I let you go; you made a pitch from the stage--SEN. GRAHAM: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: --there at Munich for foreign troops to be committed to Syria alongside American forces. How many U.S. forces are needed to stay there and has President Trump actually made that commitment to you?SEN. GRAHAM: Well that's- thank you for asking Margaret. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been destroyed. It has been defeated. All the work is not yet done. Remnants of ISIS are lethal. We need a follow own presence post caliphate destruction. The good news we can do this with a fraction of American forces we've had in Syria in the past. The real good news is Europeans are willing to contribute because their cities have been attacked from Syria. The caliphate in Syria--MARGARET BRENNAN: How many U.S. troops?SEN. GRAHAM:--has caused thousands of deaths inside of Europe. I think just a fraction, a couple of hundred, compared to twenty seven hundred would be enough to get Europeans to contribute to the stabilizing force to make sure ISIS doesn't come back like it did in Iraq, to make sure that Turkey and the Kurds don't go to war, to keep them apart, and to make sure Iran doesn't come in and take over when we leave. So, I've never felt better about the outcome in Syria with a small contingent of Americans. A lot of Europeans will come in and help fill in the gap, a very small down payment to secure ISIS never comes back. We've gone from thousands of troops in Iraq and Syria down now to a couple of hundred in Syria. Congratulations, Mr. President. The job is not yet done but we've done a hell of a job destroying the caliphate.MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you. And then they saw that they had a shot at the jackpot. In its last stages, the campaign changed. They started using WikiLeaks when they sensed that they had a chance of getting Trump into office.   US warships again challenge Beijing's claims in South China SeaBy Ryan Browne, CNN - CNN - Monday, February 11, 2019 Brad Lendon contributing The United States sailed two warships close to disputed islands in the South China Sea on Monday (Sunday night, ET), a move that is bound to draw the ire of Beijing. The guided-missile destroyers USS Spruance and USS Preble sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Spratly Islands as part of what the US Navy calls a ""freedom of navigation operation."" The operation was carried out ""to challenge excessive maritime claims and preserve access to the waterways as governed by international law,"" Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the US Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN.""All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,"" Doss said, adding ""that is true in the South China Sea as in other places around the globe."" Monday's operation was the second in the South China Sea reported by the US Navy this year. In January, the destroyer USS McCampbell sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands.Shortly after that operation, China accused the US of trespassing in its territorial waters -- and said it had deployed missiles ""capable of targeting medium and large ships. ""The US action violated the Chinese laws and international laws, infringed China's sovereignty, damaged regional peace, security, and order,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said at the time. ""China will take necessary actions to protect state sovereignty."" In late September, the USS Decatur also sailed within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson reefs in the Spratly Islands as part of a similar freedom of navigation operation. During that operation, a Chinese destroyer came within 45 yards of the US warship, forcing it to maneuver to avoid a collision. The US labeled the Chinese warship's actions unsafe and unprofessional, while Beijing said the US was threatening the safety and sovereignty of China.The US has accused Beijing of installing missiles and other military hardware on the disputed islands. ""There's been sort of a steady increase,"" Adm. John Richardson, the US Chief of Naval Operations, told reporters earlier this month when asked about China's militarization of the area. ""The weapons systems have been getting increasingly sophisticated so it's something we're watching very closely,"" he added. ""We've got big interests there so we're going to remain there,"" he added, noting that about a third of the world's trade passed through those waters.  China's military-run space station in Argentina is a 'black box' By Cassandra Garrison 1/31/2019 REUTERS China's Xi Calls on Army to Be Battle-Ready 1/4/2019 ReutersSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's armed forces must strengthen their sense of urgency and do everything they can to prepare for battle, President Xi Jinping told a meeting of top brass on Friday.China is keen to beef up its armed forces amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea and escalating tension with the United States over issues ranging from trade to the status of Taiwan.The official Xinhua news agency said Xi told a meeting of the top military authority that China faced increasing risks and challenges, and the armed forces must work to secure its security and development needs.Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, said the armed forces must devise strategies for the new era and take on responsibilities for preparing and waging war.""The world is facing a period of major changes never seen in a century, and China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development,"" he was quoted as saying.He said the armed forces needed to be able to respond quickly to emergencies, needed to upgrade their joint operations capabilities and nurture new types of combat forces.Xi's comments followed his remarks on Wednesday that China still reserved the right to use force to achieve ""reunification"" with Taiwan and prevent the island's independence.Xi's Taiwan speech came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act into law, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the island's security. (Reporting by David Stanway; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)  The National Day of Prayer 2019 is May 2nd and I hope everyone will join in preparation for a three day fast to end the morning after the National Day of Prayer. I will fast the 1st day of March and the 1st day of April to get psyched for the three day fast. I pray every day using the mantra that I chose for myself long ago that I have never shared with anyone else in my life. But I will be making an extra effort to pray for our president. Our president has declared that he will restore democracy in the Western Hemisphere, and this is a very tall order in the face of those responsible for undermining democracy in Central America, South America and around the world. The people in Venezuela have suffered enough and I will be praying that on the 23rd the food and medical supplies will get through to the people and the military will side with the interim president to force Maduro to step aside. But I fear this will not be the case because there are some big players in this fight, Russia and China. I am pressing for the president to ask Congress for a military peace keeping mission to escort the supplies to various points throughout the country with three aircraft carriers positioned in the Caribbean for backup. Restoring democracy in Guatemala and Honduras would solve the problem of immigrant caravans coming from those countries but it fails to address the source of the undermining of democracy. I would have hoped that the president could have tackled the source first but that too, is a very tall order. They control people and politicians and they kill people. The 2.2 million employees of the federal bureaucracy must be taken down to end secrecy and secure our country using only overt security. The federal employees that lined up at food kitchens after missing one paycheck are a bunch of drama queens with IRA’s and 104K’s and the federal employee union that put them up to it to play on the sympathy of the public must be stopped. They got President Obama involved in signing off on countless drone assassinations and I hope they haven’t already gotten President Donald Trump to get blood on his hands. John McCain had much to say about Sarah Palin and Donald Trump before his death. I believe much of it was taken out of context and twisted to mean quite the opposite of its intent. It seems to me that Mr. McCain was lamenting the cold and ruthless treatment of these two people by his own party as they took the national political stage. Lindsey Graham could likely give some credence to my point of view or dash it all. The fact would remain that when Sarah Palin became Mr. McCain's running mate, the GOP made sure that she would tow the party line. The same is true with Donald Trump as we have seen that though he was once pro-choice, in favor of the control of assault weapons, as well as, complimentary of the form of health insurance available in Australia, it is not the case now. If you read Chris Christies book “Let Me Finish” you will find that candidate Donald Trump was absolutely incredulous at the words attributed to him in the transcript of the “Access Hollywood” tape. This is how it is when you have been programmed to do something that you know you wouldn’t do when faced with video evidence. The border patrol employee that got a young man to drink drugs that he OD’d on, broke down in tears when confronted with the video evidence that she had caused the young man’s death. They started working on the president long before he was elected long before he became a candidate, as I believe the Access Hollywood tape is evidence of and Mr. Christies book gives credence to. Mr. Trump was absolutely right when he said that our government is guilty of doing a lot of horrible things too. These problems can be addressed but only when the people stand together in support of the man, we elected to lead us, with the help of the electoral college, that man is President Donald Trump. Personally, I like the man and I respect him because I can discern the difference between the man and the media abuse of the man. This is a strong man, but no one man can take on the Intelligence Community alone. The only way to take down the Intelligence Community and the rest of the federal bureaucracy that relies on secrecy and keeping information away from our elected officials in Congress, the public and the president is to fire them all. To do this we must shutter our embassies and bring the diplomats and staff home. President Donald Trump must give explicit orders to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to get the job done. “Let Me Finish” is very revealing of the reasons Mr. Trumps first two years have been so chaotic. Our country needs a fresh start and so does our president. The president will need help vetting all of the people that will be needed to start fresh and as chief of staff, I believe Chris Christie could be the help the president needs. I hope that the president and Mr. Christie will take my advice laid out in this document, allowing state attorney generals to play a role in narrowing the field of private sector nominees. If a lot of you don’t believe I am right about China then you need to get a copy of this to the man that is very likely to be the most knowledgeable man alive, when it comes to the history, the current intent of the actions being taken by and the future aspirations of the so called, “Peoples Republic of China”. There is only one man that fits this description and that man is the Dalai Lama of Tibet.  Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen issues a warning to the world over China by Matt Rivers, Steven Jiang and Ben Westcott, CNN 2/20/2019Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has sent out a warning to Asia in the face of mounting aggression from Beijing. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Tsai said the military threat posed by China was growing ""every day"" in line with a more assertive foreign policy under its President Xi Jinping. ""If it's Taiwan today, people should ask who's next? Any country in the region -- if it no longer wants to submit to the will of China, they would face similar military threats,"" said Tsai.Taiwan and China are separated by fewer than 130 kilometers (81 miles) at their closet point. For seven decades, the two have maintained an uneasy truce following their split at the end of a destructive civil war in 1949.Unification is a long-term aim for China's ruling Communist Party, which considers self-governed democratic Taiwan -- an island of 23 million people -- to be a renegade province. But it was the election of Tsai and her historically pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2016 which sent relations between the two governments spiraling. Beijing has placed mounting diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, conducting live-fire drills in nearby seas and flying bombers around the island. ""With China becoming increasingly strong and ambitious, we are faced with growing threats,"" Tsai said. ""Our challenge is whether our independent existence, security, prosperity and democracy can be maintained. This is the biggest issue for Taiwan.""Taiwan's unofficial ally the United States has for decades acted as the island's security guarantee against the threat of Chinese military action. But when asked directly, Tsai wouldn't be drawn on whether she believed US President Donald Trump would come to her aid. Instead the Taiwan leader said she is focused on strengthening Taiwan's own defense capabilities in the face of an ""imbalanced war,"" as China's military modernizes. ""We have to be prepared at all times,"" she said.'Growing threats'As the first woman to be elected Taiwan's leader, Tsai was carried into office on a swell of anti-Beijing sentiment following attempts by the Kuomintang party to move closer to China. But her popularity has fallen steadily in the face of domestic opposition to her policies and a struggling Taiwan economy battling to keep up with the mainland. In November Tsai's DPP suffered a bruising defeat in local elections, losing by as much as 10% across the island. Tsai said the 2018 result was due to what she called a ""challenging"" domestic reform agenda. ""The people don't feel the result of the reform so much when you've just started,"" she said. The setback has not deterred Tsai who revealed to CNN she would stand for re-election in 2020. ""It's natural that any sitting president wants to do more for the country.""China's Xi is unlikely to welcome a second term for Tsai. Since she came to power, the Chinese government has increasingly tried to exert pressure on Taiwan, known officially as the Republic of China, to unify with the People's Republic of China, as the mainland is officially known. In January, Xi Jinping called for the ""peaceful reunification"" of China and Taiwan in a landmark speech, warning that Taiwan independence was a ""dead end.""  ""We make no promise to renounce the use of force,"" the Chinese leader said. Tsai said President Xi's January speech had caused concern within Taiwan. She said the island refused to become another Hong Kong or Macau -- both semi-autonomous cities under Beijing's rule. ""(The speech) has alarmed us that Taiwan's independent existence may be changed,"" she said. But Tsai said the threats and intimidation out of Beijing are counter-productive to Xi's goals and serve only to push the island further away from the Communist Party and strengthen support for democracy. ""China may feel such (pressure) would create a sense of failure for people in Taiwan and deal a blow on our morale. But every such move has only further upset and alienated Taiwanese people,"" she said. ""China's behavior has only backfired in Taiwan.""Warmer ties with TrumpIn January Taiwan held military drills intended to ready its troops in the event of an invasion from the mainland. Photos showed dramatic images of helicopters and artillery launchers conducting live-fire exercises. Tsai said she was strengthening Taiwan's military capabilities in the face of China's rapid modernization. She said Taiwan was ""on alert 24/7"" for the first sign of a Chinese strike. ""What we are expecting is, after withstanding the first wave of Chinese attacks ourselves, the rest of the world would stand up to exert strong pressure on China,"" she said.While Tsai did not say it specifically, it's likely any pressure exerted on China will come from Washington. For years, the United States has provided a tacit guarantee of protection from Beijing. Under Trump, the relationship between Washington and Taipei has grown closer with expanded weapons sales and greater vocal support from US politicians. In 2018 Trump signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act, encouraging ""visits between officials of the United States and Taiwan at all levels."" Months later, the US approved the sale of submarine parts to Taiwan. In June, the US opened a new, $255 million de facto embassy on the island, known as the American Institute in Taiwan.Many leaders around the world have criticized President Trump for focusing on domestic US interests at the expense of the international community but Tsai said she didn't see it that way. ""Any president has to take multiple factors into consideration when making decisions, especially domestic decisions. That's why President Trump has been emphasizing 'America First',"" she said.Trump broke decades of protocol and took a brief congratulatory call from Tsai upon his election in 2016, but the two have yet to meet in person. There is an outside chance that could change this year. A group of US lawmakers, led by well-known China hardliner Marco Rubio, have asked US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to invite Tsai to address a joint meeting of the US Congress. But Tsai declined to say whether she would accept an invitation to speak, a move that should it go ahead would be sure to infuriate China. ""It's not a simple question of invitation and acceptance,"" said Tsai. ""Whether or not to go deliver a speech in Washington would depend on whether such a move benefits Taiwan, our relations with the US and regional stability."" The US has been careful, at least publicly, to adhere to a so-called ""one China"" policy, acknowledging Beijing's assertion that Taiwan is part of China, as well as the People's Republic's status as the sole legitimate government of China. It is this policy that sees the US base its embassy in Beijing, but not in Taipei. But Washington has also maintained deliberate ambiguity on the status of Taiwan, only encouraging both sides to engage in dialogue to settle their long-running disputes.Caught in the middleTrump's foreign policy hasn't all been good news for Taiwan. As the US President tries to drive down the trade deficit, Taiwan has become caught in the middle of a US-China trade war. ""There's a lot of trade and economic flow between Taiwan and the US as well as investment and trade with China,"" said Tsai. ""We have to make sure that we can lessen the impact of any kind of uncertainty on Taiwan's economy."" Tsai said with no clear end to the trade dispute in sight, she was taking actions to protect Taiwan, including government spending to stimulate domestic consumption and investment. ""So that the growth of our economy can be driven by domestic demand instead of an over reliance on exports,"" said Tsai.But while the trade war may cause difficulties for Taiwan's exports, it could present an opportunity for the island's tech sector. The US is currently ramping up its opposition to Chinese technology, in particular the telecoms giant Huawei, over concerns of potential security threats. Both US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have warned countries that using Chinese 5G mobile phone technology will make it more difficult to work with the US. Tsai said that unlike Chinese products, other countries had no such security concerns about Taiwan's technology. ""Taiwan is a very secure location for the manufacture of such products,"" she said. “We manufacture and design a lot of high-tech products such as semiconductors and we rank in the front in terms of worldwide production.""Taiwan faces down ChinaThroughout her interview, Tsai painted the picture of Taiwan as an underdog facing down the growing might of Beijing, the first line of defense for the liberal, democratic world order. ""If a vibrant democracy that champions universal values and follows international rules were destroyed by China, it would be a huge setback for global democracy,"" she said. Set against that backdrop, military tensions between Taiwan, China and the US have continued to rise. On January 2019, Washington sent two guided missile destroyers, the USS McCampbell and USNS Walter S. Diehl, through the Taiwan Strait in a message of defiance to Beijing.In February, China's People's Liberation Army issued a propaganda video juxtaposing images of Chinese jets and bombers with famous landmarks across Taiwan. In reply, the Taiwan military posted dramatic footage of soldiers, tanks and explosions, followed by a simple message -- ""On standby 24/7."" Tsai said China wants to become a ""global hegemony"" and if Xi's attention turns to expansion outside of the country's borders, Taiwan would be ""first to be hit."" ""I believe this is not just an issue of Taiwan under attack, but a reflection of China's willingness to use force for its expansionist policy,"" she said. ""It's not just Taiwan's interests at stake, it's the whole region'sor eventhe whole world's.""Trump pushes U.S. tech companies to step up work for 5G: Reuters – 2, 21, 2019 WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Thursday called on U.S. telecommunications companies to boost their work to build faster 5G wireless communications networks, saying they were lagging and at risk of being left behind other countries' efforts. ""American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind,"" Trump said in a pair of tweets.""I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies,"" he added, although he did not explain what blockage he was referring to. Representatives for the White House could not be immediately reached for comment.The Trump administration has been seeking ways to speed the deployment of faster wireless communications systems that could help a number of industries. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission chairman moved to eliminate regulatory barriers to 5G deployment by capping local fees and requiring faster application reviews. The Republican president's administration has also been warning other countries against adopting 5G systems from Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, citing security concerns.

Thank you, sir!  US says Alabama woman who joined Islamic State isn't citizenBy MATTHEW LEE and JAY REEVES, Associated Press, 2/20/2019  WASHINGTON — An Alabama woman who joined the Islamic State group in Syria won't be allowed to return to the United States with her toddler son because she is not an American citizen, the U.S. said Wednesday. Her lawyer is challenging that claim. In a brief statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave no details as to how the administration made their determination. ""Ms. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States,"" he said. ""She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport nor any visa to travel to the United States.""But Hassan Shibly, a lawyer for the woman, insisted Muthana was born in the United States and had a valid passport before she joined the Islamic State in 2014. He says she has renounced the terrorist group and wants to come home to protect her 18-month-old son regardless of the legal consequences. ""She's an American. Americans break the law,"" said Shibly, a lawyer with the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""When people break the law, we have a legal system to handle those kinds of situations to hold people accountable, and that's all she's asking for.""Muthana and her son are now in a refugee camp in Syria, along with others who fled the remnants of the Islamic State. Shibly said that the administration argues that she didn't qualify for citizenship because her father was a Yemeni diplomat. But the lawyer said her father had not had diplomatic status ""for months"" before her birth in Hackensack, New Jersey. He released a copy of the woman's birth certificate, issued two months after her birth in October 1994, to support his claim.President Donald Trump said Wednesday on Twitter that he was behind the decision to deny her entry, tweeting that ""I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!"" The announcement came a day after Britain said that it was stripping the citizenship of Shamima Begum, a 19-year-old who left the country in 2015 with two friends to join the Islamic State and recently gave birth in a refugee camp. It also comes as the U.S. has urged allies to back citizens who joined IS but are now in the custody of the American-backed forces fighting the remnants of the brutally extremist group that once controlled a vast area spanning parts of Syria and Iraq.Muthana's lawyer said she was ""just a stupid, naive, young dumb woman,"" when she became enamored of Islamic State, believing it was an organization that protected Muslims. Shibly said she fled her family in Alabama and made her way to Syria, where she was ""brainwashed"" by IS and compelled to marry one of the group's soldiers. After he was killed, she married another, the father of her son. After her second husband was also killed, she married a third IS fighter but she ""became disenchanted with the marriage,"" and decided to escape, the lawyer said.Shibly, based in Tampa, Florida, said he intends to file a legal challenge to the government's decision to deny her entry to the country. Muthana's status had been considered by lawyers from the departments of State and Justice since her case arose, according to one U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official would not elaborate but said Pompeo's statement was based on the lawyers' conclusions. The State Department declined to disclose details about her father or Muthana's case, citing privacy law.Most people born in the United States are accorded so-called birthright citizenship, but there are exceptions. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person born in the U.S. to an accredited foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to U.S. law and is not automatically considered a U.S. citizen at birth. However, Muthana's case is unusual, if not unprecedented in that she once held a U.S. passport. Passports are only issued to citizens by birth or naturalization, according to Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who has studied the phenomenon of foreign Islamic State fighters and families.Hughes said the decision is also unusual because it comes just days after the Trump administration urged European nations to repatriate extremists from Syria as the Islamic State nears collapse. ""If you are trying to make the case that others should take back their people, it stands to reason that you would do that, too,"" he said.Muthana, who says she dodged sniper fire and roadside bombs to escape, is ready to pay the penalty for her actions but wants freedom and safety for the son, her lawyer said. In a letter released by Shibly, Muthana wrote that she made ""a big mistake"" by rejecting her family and friends in the United States to join the Islamic State. ""During my years in Syria I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war which changed me,"" she wrote. ""To say that I regret my past words, any pain that I caused my family and any concerns I would cause my country would be hard for me to really express properly.""Shibly said Muthana was brainwashed online before she left Alabama and now could have valuable intelligence for U.S. forces, but he said the FBI didn't seem interested in retrieving her from the refugee camp where she is living with her son. Muthana's father would welcome the woman back, Shibly said, but she is not on speaking terms with her mother. Ashfaq Taufique, who knows Muthana's family and is president of the Birmingham Islamic Society, said the woman could be a valuable resource for teaching young people about the dangers of online radicalization were she allowed to return to the United States. ""Her coming back could be a very positive thing for our community and our country,"" Taufique said. Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama.

You need to put 50,000 troops in Iraq and 50,000 on the ground in Afghanistan and secure the borders of both of these strategic locations. This will send the message that there will be no vacuum for China’s puppets to fill. You need to have Mike Pompeo shuttering Embassies and bringing Ambassadors and staff home. You need to have Jared Kushner deliver explicit orders to Saudi Arabia and Israel to cease all military engagements and prepare to assist in delivering aid to Yemen and assessing what must be done to help rebuild the infrastructure. The Yemeni people want democracy just like the rest of the people in the world and we should help them begin electing local officials and warn about the pitfalls of secrecy and allowing their representatives to elect the executive. Mike Pence should have a permanent office in Iraq to apply the thumbscrews to Putin, Erdogan and Assad to allow free and fair elections. We need to offer to begin airlifting thousands of refugees per week out of NATO countries to Iraq and Afghanistan in exchange for them supplying the troops to drive Russia out of Crimea and the Ukraine. This is just the beginning, when the dust has settled and China is steppin and fetchin wondering what to do, you’ll love phase two.Dairy farming is dying: After 40 years, I'm done Jim Goodman - WP – 12, 21, 2018After 40 years of dairy farming, I sold my herd of cows. The herd had been in my family since 1904; I know all 45 cows by name. I couldn’t find anyone who wanted to take over our farm — who would? Dairy farming is little more than hard work and possible economic suicide. A grass-based organic dairy farm bought my cows. I couldn’t watch them go. In June, I milked them for the last time, left the barn and let the truckers load them. A cop-out on my part? Perhaps, but being able to remember them as I last saw them, in my barn, chewing their cuds and waiting for pasture, is all I have left.My retirement was mostly voluntary. Premature, but there is some solace in having a choice. Unlike many dairy farmers, I didn’t retire bankrupt. But for my wife and me, having to sell our herd was a sign — of the economic death not just of rural America but also of a way of life. It is nothing short of heartbreaking to walk through our barn and know that those stalls will remain empty; knowing that our losses reflect the greater damage inflicted on entire regions is worse. When I started farming in 1979, the milk from 45 cows could pay the bills, cover new machinery and buildings, and allow us to live a decent life and start a family. My father had farmed through the Great Depression, and his advice — “don’t borrow any more than you have to” — stuck with me and probably saved the farm many times over. We survived the 1980s, when debt loads became impossible for many farmers and merely incredibly onerous for the lucky ones. Interest rates went up, export markets plummeted after a wheat embargo against the Soviet Union, oil prices soared, inflation skyrocketed, and land prices began to collapse. More than 250,000 farms died that decade, and more than 900 farmers committed suicide in the upper Midwest alone.Farms felt the impact most directly, but there were few in rural communities who were untouched. All the businesses that depended on farm dollars watched as their incomes dried up and the tax base shrank. Farm foreclosures meant fewer families and fewer kids, so schools were forced to close. The Main Street cafes and coffee shops — where farmers talked prices, the weather and politics — shut down as well. As devastating as the 1980s were for farmers, today’s crisis is worse. Ineffective government subsidies and insurance programs are worthless in the face of plummeting prices and oversupply (and tariffs certainly aren’t helping). The current glut of organic milk has caused a 30 percent decrease in the price I was paid for my milk over the past two years. The new farm bill, signed by President Trump on Thursday, provides modest relief for larger dairy farmers (it expands some subsidies, and farmers will be able to pay lower premiums to participate in a federal program that offers compensation when milk prices drop below a certain level), but farmers don’t want subsidies; all we ever asked for were fair prices. So, for many, this is little more than another PR stunt, and the loss of family farms will continue. This year, Wisconsin, where I live, had lost 382 dairy farms by August; last year, the number at the same point was 283. The despair is palpable; suicide is a fact of life, though many farm suicides are listed as accidents.A farmer I knew for many years came home from town, folded his good clothes for the last time and killed himself. I saw no warning, though maybe others did. When family farms go under, the people leave and the buildings are often abandoned, but the land remains, often sold to the nearest land baron. Hillsides and meadows that were once grasslands for pasturing cattle become acre upon acre of corn-soybean agriculture. Farming becomes a business where it used to be a way of life. With acreages so large, owners use pesticides and chemical fertilizers to ensure that the soil can hold an unsustainable rotation of plants upright, rather than caring for the soil as a living biotic community.Those dairy farms that remain milk hundreds or thousands of cows, keeping them in huge barns and on concrete lots. The animals seldom, if ever, get the chance to set their feet on what little grass is there. Pigs are raised indoors for their entire lives, never feeling the sun or rain or what it’s like to roll in mud. All the machinery has become bigger, noisier, and some days it runs around the clock. Manure from the mega-farms is hauled for miles in huge tanker trucks or pumped through irrigation lines onto crop fields. The smell, the flies and the airborne pathogens that go with it have effectively done away with much of the peaceful countryside I used to know.What kind of determination does it take for someone young and hopeful to begin a life of farming in times like these? Getting credit as a small farmer is more difficult today. As prices continue to fall, increasing production and farm size is often the only way to survive. But there is just too much — too much milk, too much grain, too much livestock — thanks to tightening export markets and declining domestic demand for dairy products. The situation is great for the processors who buy from the farmers, but it will never give the farmers a fair price.With fewer farms, there are fewer foreclosures than in the 1980s. But watching your neighbor’s farm and possessions being auctioned off is no more pleasant today than it was 30 years ago. Seeing a farm family look on as their life’s work is sold off piece by piece; the cattle run through a corral, parading for the highest bid; tools, household goods and toys piled as “boxes of junk” and sold for a few dollars while the kids hide in the haymow crying — auctions are still too painful for me.As I end my career as a farmer, I feel fortunate it lasted as long as it did. Some choices made long ago did keep me ahead of the curve, at least for a while. I always told people that 45 cows were enough for me and being able to give them names rather than numbers and appreciate each one’s unique nature was important. I remember Adel, who always found her way across the pasture for a good head scratch, and Lara, whose sandpaper tongue always found my face as I milked her. Cows like these didn’t fit into the “get big or get out” theory of farming that took over during the 1980s, so over the years, we needed to get better ideas or get out. By switching to organic production and direct marketing, we managed to make a decent living. We also found that this method of farming required good environmental stewardship and direct involvement with our rural community. And, for almost 20 years, it worked.But organic dairying has become a victim of its own success. It was profitable and thus fell victim to the “get big” model. Now, our business is dominated by large organic operations that are more factory than farm. It seems obvious that they simply cannot be following the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s strict organic production standards (like pasturing cattle), rules that we smaller farmers see as common sense. Although small organic farms pioneered the concept, organic certification has become something not meant for us — and a label that mega-farms co-opted and used to break us. When six dairy farms in Texas feed their thousands of cows a diet of organic grain and stored forage, with no discernible access to a blade of grass, they end up producing more milk than all 453 organic dairy farms in Wisconsin combined. Then they ship it north, undercutting our price. We can’t make ends meet and are forced out of the business. We played by the rules, but we no longer have a level playing field.Despite this, I hung on, but I couldn’t continue milking cows indefinitely. Perhaps it’s for the best. A few years before we sold our herd, we had to install huge fans in our barn — the summers were getting too hot for the cows to be out during the heat of the day. Climate change would have made our future in farming that much harder. We could have adapted, I think, but we ran out of time. They say a farmer gets 40 chances. For 40 years, each spring brings another shot at getting it right, at succeeding or failing or something in between. If that were ever true, it isn’t now. That’s why, after my 40 chances, I’m done. Taliban Carry Out Dozens of Attacks Daily Despite Peace Talks, IG Finds 2/2/2019 Military.com | By Richard SiskThe Taliban have been carrying out more than 27 attacks daily in Afghanistan while engaging the U.S. in peace talks, according to the Pentagon's Inspector General's office.The IG's report said that, in the three-month period from Oct. 1 through Dec. 30, the Taliban initiated a total of 2,517 attacks, or slightly more than 27 daily. All of the attacks were defined by NATO's Resolute Support mission as ""effective enemy-initiated attacks,"" meaning that each resulted in at least one casualty, the IG report said. The number of attacks also represented a 10 percent increase over the same period in 2017, the report states.During the last quarter of 2018, U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad held three rounds of talks with the Taliban. In January, he announced that insurgent leaders had agreed in principle on the framework of a peace deal that would allow for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and include pledges from the Taliban that Afghanistan would not become a safe haven for terrorists. However, the Taliban have yet to agree to meet with the Afghan government on the framework or outline future relations with the U.S., the IG report states. The latest IG report lacks the usual sections on humanitarian assistance, government reform, infrastructure and other issues due to the 35-day partial government shutdown and the furlough of State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development personnel. In sum, the IG report states that ""the security situation in Afghanistan remained volatile during the quarter. The Taliban continued to attack Afghan security forces and election facilities while U.S. and coalition forces intensified Afghan-led operations to counter the Taliban and terrorist organizations."" U.S. Forces-Afghanistan told the IG that the Taliban ""continued to threaten provincial capitals, including Ghazni city and Farah city,"" two cities that came under Taliban siege in 2018. Afghan security forces repelled recent attacks on provincial capitals, but ""the Taliban remained active on the periphery of urban centers,"" according to the report.Despite the increase in attacks in the last quarter, the Afghan government held parliamentary elections in October, in which four million out of 8.5 million registered voters cast ballots, the IG report states. However, Taliban attacks on election day killed 52 people and wounded 336 across the country, and the election was marred by closed polling centers, inaccurate voter lists, and confusion over the use of biometric devices, it added. In addition, the Taliban and the Islamic State offshoot known as ISIS-K killed a total of 10 candidates and wounded or abducted six others, according to the report. The results of the election have yet to be released.  Migrants are being paid thousands of dollars to return home: Saphora Smith and Ahmed Mengli - NBC News - Monday, January 28, 2019KABUL, Afghanistan — A wave of anxiety washed over Mohammad Farooq Niazi as the plane touched down in his homeland. ""I missed my country,"" he said, recalling his mindset on the day he returned to Afghanistan after almost three years of trying to build a new life in Europe. ""But I wasn't feeling safe."" As traffic crawled into Kabul, Niazi worried he'd be killed in one of the regular attacks carried out by militant groups including the Taliban and the Islamic State.Niazi, 27, is one of thousands of Afghan migrants who have been paid to return home by European governments. Austria gave him $3,100 and a one-way ticket to Kabul. The rest was up to him. More than 400,000 Afghans lodged asylum claims in Europe for the first time from 2015 through 2017, according to European Union figures. Hundreds of thousands of other migrants also arrived in E.U. countries during that period, including many fleeing conflicts, rampant corruption and extreme poverty in Africa and the Middle East. But the number of Afghans returned by European countries to their homeland — either forcefully or voluntarily — nearly tripled, from 3,290 in 2015 to 9,460 the following year, according to Amnesty International. While some failed asylum-seekers are forcibly removed, others like Niazi opt for the United Nations-operated Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration program, which enables host nations to pay willing returnees to go home. (The U.S. does not fund assisted voluntary returns to any country.) The amount of money paid by European countries to migrants under the program ranges from around $500 to $4,500 per person, according to Amnesty International. Advocates of the measure say supporting returning migrants financially helps them to rebuild their lives. They say it also promotes reintegration, as some countries attach conditions to receiving funds such as setting up a business, enrolling in a course or renting an apartment. But other migration experts and rights groups say the program is not truly voluntary, as often people feel they have no choice but to sign up amid the threat of being forcibly removed. Some also argue it legitimizes returns to countries that are not safe.Culture shockThe first thing Niazi noticed on disembarking from the plane last spring was the state of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. ""It's very old and unprofessional in comparison to those of European countries,"" he said. Nearly three years in Europe had changed Niazi. While he was happy to see his mother again, Niazi said life in Afghanistan initially felt ""unfamiliar"" and the day-to-day violence weighed on his mind. He got by on the $3,100 given to him under the U.N. program and went into business with his uncle, who is a butcher. But after almost a year of being back in Afghanistan, Niazi says he still does not feel safe and says he plans to return to Europe with his mother and his new wife as soon as possible. Otherwise ""our child will be born in a place where there is no peace or stability,"" he said. ""Afghanistan is not for living or finding jobs.""'Crime, terrorism, civil unrest'Many Afghans like Niazi worry about their families' safety in a country where an emboldened Taliban is fighting U.S.-led NATO forces and the government of President Ashraf Ghani. The militants were toppled by American forces in 2001 after sheltering 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, but now hold sway over almost half of the country and are again imposing their strict version of Islam on swaths of the population.By all accounts, security in Afghanistan is deteriorating. The first half of 2018 was the deadliest ever for Afghan civilians, with 1,700 people killed, according to a recent study commissioned by Save the Children. The State Department also warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan due to ""crime, terrorism, civil unrest and armed conflict."" A recent report by Amnesty International on forced and voluntary returns to the country concluded that returns were taking place despite evidence that people ""face a real risk of serious human rights violations."" Nicola Graviano, who works for the International Organization for Migration, the U.N. body that runs the program, said it continually monitors conditions on the ground as part of the voluntary returns process. That ""doesn't mean, though, that the situation is rosy everywhere,"" he said. ""It's a constantly evolving situation and we need to be ready to adapt and reconsider our lines."" He cautioned that the principles of international law — such as not forcing asylum-seekers to return to a place where they face persecution — applied when returning migrants to Afghanistan.Liza Schuster, an expert in migration policy based at City, University of London, questioned whether the U.N. program should be used to return people to a ""country in conflict"" like Afghanistan. ""For some people who feel they have absolutely no other choice, they will take assisted voluntary return,"" she said. ""Even though the voluntary is in heavily inverted quotes."" According to Schuster, migrants are often told by officials in the West that ""if we have to force you back on a plane you won't receive anything when you arrive."" Taking the money as part of the U.N. program can often appear to be a better answer.Starting overSaleem Paigeer, 53, has struggled to find work since opting to return from Germany last year. A father of four, Paigeer now volunteers for a political party, but has no income and is living off the $3,400 he received. With the money running out fast, he says the family is struggling to make ends meet. ""It is not enough for a family coming back from migration and starting life from zero. A house needs a lot of things,"" he said, listing household appliances he could not afford.Paigeer had lived abroad for 24 years and says his children — his youngest is 8 — are now struggling to settle.Being a woman in Afghanistan is ""very bad,"" he said, explaining that his daughters found it difficult to adjust to life with less freedom. Afghanistan is still one of the worst places on earth to be a girl or a woman, with maternal mortality rates among the highest in the world and domestic violence rife. In many parts of the country, it is dangerous or culturally unacceptable for girls to go to school and in the worst-affected provinces up to 85 percent of girls do not attend class, according to humanitarian organizations.A generation gapAbdul Raziq Raziqian, 50, said that while he was over the moon to be given money to exchange Germany's gray skies for Afghanistan's sunny weather, his younger children were desperate to return abroad. ""They miss the playgrounds and the school, they really want to go back,"" he said. Raziqian, who has five children, admits that if he had been able to find work in Germany he would have preferred to stay. However, he resents the way the abilities of migrants tended to be dismissed, with asylum-seekers pigeonholed into work ""which didn't suit"" them. Raziqian said ""uneducated and educated, skilled and unskilled people"" — including doctors — were just seen primarily as migrants. ""They wanted to break our honor,"" he added.Now back in Afghanistan, Raziqian said he is also struggling to provide for his family despite owning 20 percent of a spare-parts shop in the western city of Herat. He said if his younger children win scholarships to study abroad, he and his wife would follow, but otherwise the family doesn't have the means to try to migrate again.Political pressureDespite the security issues, European countries believe Afghanistan still has the ability to take more returnees. In 2016, the E.U. and the government in Kabul agreed to a pact that aimed to ""step up their cooperation"" on preventing economic migrants from traveling to Europe as well as returning rejected asylum-seekers to Afghanistan. As the boats keep coming across the Mediterranean Sea and the political pressure to keep migrants out builds across the continent, the number of asylum claims approved involving Afghans fell from 67 percent in 2015 to 46 percent in 2017, according to E.U. statistics. But Abdul Ghafoor, who runs the Afghanistan Migrants Advice and Support Organization in Kabul, said in his experience the majority of the younger men who return through the U.N. program eventually attempt to return to the West again. ""The security situation has gone from bad to worse, especially in the last year or so,"" he said. ""Those who come back voluntarily cannot survive in the country, and so they try to leave for Europe again."" Saphora Smith reported from London, and Ahmed Mengli from Kabul. Taliban and U.S. Agree to Draft of Peace Framework By MUJIB MASHAL - The New York Times - Monday, 1,  28, 2019 KABUL, Afghanistan — American and Taliban officials have agreed in principle to the framework of a deal in which the insurgents would guarantee to prevent Afghan territory from being used by terrorists, and that could lead to a full pullout of American troops in return for larger concessions from the Taliban, the chief United States negotiator said Monday. The American envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said those concessions must include the Taliban’s agreeing to a cease-fire and to talk directly with the Afghan government, issues that the insurgents have doggedly opposed in the past.“We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,” Mr. Khalilzad said in an interview with The New York Times in Kabul. “The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.” He added: “We felt enough confidence that we said we need to get this fleshed out, and details need to be worked out.”After nine years of halting efforts to reach a peace deal with the Taliban, the draft framework, though preliminary, is the biggest tangible step toward ending a two-decade war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and profoundly changed American foreign policy. A senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, said the Taliban delegation had asked for time to confer with their leadership about the American requirement for the insurgents’ agreement to direct Afghan talks and a cease-fire. The official described all those issues as “interconnected” as part of a “package deal” that was likened to a Russian nesting doll. The official’s account was supported by details that have been leaked by some Taliban and Western officials in recent days.A senior Taliban official with direct knowledge of the talks on Monday confirmed the draft agreement on the issue of foreign troop withdrawal and that the Taliban pledge that Afghan soil would not be used against others. He said “working groups” would iron out details on the timeline of the withdrawal. But in a sign that the conditions the Americans have tied the finalizing of the deal to may be difficult to reach, the Taliban official said he did not see the agreement as conditioned on a cease-fire or Taliban talking to the Afghan government. The official declined to say what the Taliban position on the latter two issues was.Diplomats in Kabul aware of the way Mr. Khalilzad has characterized the progress in talks also said the American envoy was candid that the conditions they had laid to the Taliban before a deal could be finalized might prove difficult to agree to. Mr. Khalilzad had expressed that he was still seeking ways, including assistance from regional countries, to convince the Taliban to meet the Afghan side and agree to a cease-fire.One diplomat said Mr. Khalilzad had suggested the idea of “freezing” the agreement on the two central issues and waiting for Taliban to deliver on the conditions laid out for finalizing it. But he also suggested that might test President Trump’s already waning patience. Mr. Khalilzad returned to Afghanistan on Sunday to brief the government in Kabul after conducting six days of talks with the Taliban delegation in Doha, Qatar.In an address to the nation after being briefed by Mr. Khalilzad, President Ashraf Ghani expressed concern that a peace deal would be rushed. He highlighted previous settlements that ended in bloodshed, including when the Soviet Union withdrew from the country in the late 1980s. Despite a promise of a peace deal at the time, Afghanistan broke into anarchy, and years later the Afghan president who had been in charge during that transition, Najibullah, was hanged from a pole at a traffic roundabout.“We want peace quickly, we want it soon, but we want it with prudence,” Mr. Ghani said. “Prudence is important, so we do not repeat past mistakes.” There is concern among senior Afghan officials about the fact that the Afghan government has still been sidelined from the talks. Officials close to Mr. Ghani say he is particularly concerned that the Americans might negotiate important agreements that Afghan officials are not party to, potentially including the shape of an interim government outside of elections. Mr. Ghani has repeatedly insisted that such details only be taken up in direct talks between the government and the Taliban.Fueling Mr. Ghani’s suspicion is the circulation of a potential draft agreement written by a former American diplomat who had held several meetings with the Taliban before Mr.Khalilzad was appointed to the role. The document was written by the former diplomat Laurel Miller for RAND, and a leaked draft of it has been circulating in Kabul. The draft says it tries to envision “as realistically as possible” what a final peace agreement could look like, and at the heart of it is the formation of a transitional government on interim basis that could include the Taliban as well. That transition authority would then pave the way for changing the Constitution and holding elections that would include the Taliban in some agreed-upon way.Mr. Ghani, who is running for a second five-year term in elections now scheduled for July, has repeatedly lashed out against that idea. “Afghans do not accept an interim government — not today, not tomorrow, not in a hundred years,” Mr. Ghani, a former academic, said last week. “Whoever comes up with such stupid ideas — a few former officials that I wouldn’t even accept as my students — should think again.”On Monday, Mr. Khalilzad insisted that he was trying to push the Taliban to negotiate those points directly with the Afghan side. “There are a lot of reports that we have discussed an interim government: No, I have not gotten into any of that discussion,” Mr. Khalilzad said. “I have not entered into what that could look like with the Taliban — they would like to talk to me about it, but I have not.”During the talks last week, the Taliban signaled their seriousness by appointing one of their most powerful officials from the original movement, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, as their chief peace negotiator. Though American and Afghan officials said that Mr. Baradar was not directly involved in the marathon meetings last week, with some sessions lasting as long as eight hours, he was expected to take the lead in the talks to come. The senior American officials said new high-level talks would start in late February but suggested that teams from both sides could start on technical details before then.The interview with Mr. Khalilzad on Monday was the first time that the American government had directly confirmed some details of the agreement taking shape. As the first step in the framework, Mr. Khalilzad said that the Taliban were firm about agreeing to keep Afghan territory from being used as a staging ground for terrorism by groups like Al Qaeda and other international terrorists and had agreed to provide guarantees and an enforcement mechanism for that promise. That had long been a primary demand by American officials, in an effort to keep Afghanistan from reverting back to being the kind of terrorist base it had been at the war’s start, in 2001 after Al Qaeda’s Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.The next set of contingencies laid out by the senior American official involved in the talks would see the United States agreeing to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, but only in return for the Taliban’s entering talks with the Afghan government and agreeing to a lasting cease-fire. Those last two points have long been resisted by Taliban officials, and could still provide trouble with the process, officials say. The Taliban delegation in Qatar said they had to break to discuss those details with their leadership. But the agreement in principle to discussing them at all was seen as a breakthrough after years of failed attempts, American and Afghan officials said. Dozens of Afghan Intel Personnel Killed in Taliban Attack1/22/2019 HOMELAND SECURITY by Rahim Faiez and Amir Shah AP KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Afghan officials confirmed Tuesday that dozens of victims killed the previous day in a brazen Taliban attack on a military base not far from Kabul were members of the country’s intelligence agency — a severe blow to the government which has already lost control of nearly half of Afghanistan to insurgents. Provincial officials said at least 45 people were killed and as many as 70 were wounded when a suicide bomber drove a Humvee into the base in eastern Maidan Wardak province and detonated his load as he rammed the vehicle into the main building there on Monday. There were fears, however, that the death toll from the daytime assault on the base, which also serves as a training center for a pro-government militia and is run by the country’s intelligence service known as the National Directorate for Security, or NDS, is even higher. The NDS on Tuesday said its reports show 36 military personnel were killed and 58 were wounded. Though the agency’s figures were lower than what provincial officials had reported, it was still an unprecedented casualty toll for the agency, among the best equipped and trained in Afghanistan.The agency said the suicide bomber in the armored Humvee had managed to penetrate the gate of the base on the outskirts of Maidan Shar, the provincial capital located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Kabul, even though guards fired at the vehicle. Khawanin Sultani, a council member in the province, said the building collapsed from the explosion, which likely contributed to the high casualty numbers. “Most of the bodies were under the destroyed building,” he said. “…the building collapsed from the explosion, …”CIA 911 fingerprints all over that one!The CIA obviously wants to stay to keep an eye on their poppy gardens. Which is exactly the reason why our military must drive them and the FBI and any of the rest of the alphabet soup out by force if necessary. That, of course, will not be necessary since all these agents and personnel are patriotic Americans who respect the fact that Donald Trump is the peoples chosen leader and the Commander and Chief of the Unite States military therefore, all intelligence agents will respond to his call to return stateside, along with the diplomats and staff being airlifted out of countries around the world. Our military must collect reconnaissance intel and it will by using drones. All other intelligence gathering will come from videotaped interviews of refugees and immigrants and walk-ins at an embassy as they reopen. When will an Inspector General’s book detailing the investigation of the crimes that took place on 9/11/2001 be available that explains the reasons for the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan? The answer: If an official investigation is opened and when it is completed.            As we collect all of the historic and economic information of the past 300-years and the interconnected matrix of people and events are exposed the simple truth becomes clear. For all of the seemingly extremely complex events that have taken place, it is the simple repeated use of the same methods over this period of time that the growing archive of empirical evidence some things perfectly clear. Ruthless unregulated capitalism leads to larger, more corrupt national monopolies and ruthless unregulated globalism leads to larger more corrupt international corporations. The primary underlying method of achieving these goals has been the use of secrecy to control individuals by getting them to incriminate themselves or engage in abnormal sexual behavior that was abhorrent to society in general prior to 1980 and make close familial relationships between parents and children unacceptable and eventually illegal. The promotion of abnormal sexual behavior in the US public school system that started in 1965 led to an explosion of gay rights advocates in the eighties. The public-school legislation that propelled this cultural revolution was a career achievement for J. Edgar Hoovers FBI. Another career achievement of Mr. Hoovers FBI was not realized until just after his death, which was the legislation that made natural familial relationships that had previously been protected by the right to privacy, against the law. The simple methods that had been being used long before Hoovers FBI, become more clear because “History Repeats Itself”. After the Jewish Illuminati bankers were infiltrated and corrupted, they promoted Zionism that defines itself as being the literal interpretation of the Torah which resulted in what traditional Jews regard as the exact opposite of Judaism. After leaders of the American Nazi Party met with leaders of the KKK they concluded that both had the same goals and joined as one. When Germany lost the war, the racist KKK and American Nazi Party went underground as evangelicals, what had traditionally been a black religious movement and transformed it by insisting on the literal interpretation of the Bible. These types of repeated themes go far back into recorded history, perhaps  10,000-years. What has made these themes so hard to recognize has been the perpetrators willingness to use genocidal wars when the perpetrators have become aware that their goals and methods have become known. By and large, they have always been the winners and the winners are the recorders of history and their goal has been to rewrite history to further their goals, not to record the truth. But, as the saying goes; “There’s truth in lies too, if you here enough of them.” The truth is revealed by the repeated use of the same methods. All of the empirical evidence, historic and economic point to the undeniable fact that unregulated corrupt capitalism and unregulated corrupt globalism will result in the most powerful Nation-State that not only claims ownership of all of its territory and business entities built upon it, but also the people themselves, China will become the global authority, either by force in the next decade or by default in the next couple of decades, as the result of the total chaos caused by over population, this is China’s long-game. China short game is to take the world by force as soon as they are capable of it. The fact that China scapegoated the Illuminati Jewish bankers as the master infiltrators of all entities possible has led investigative reporters and truth digging historians to wrongly identify Zionists as the rulers of the world, while they are in fact the programmed dupes of the Chinese. China is the “Octopus”, but it only has a loose control over its tentacles. It has not always been the winner of wars either, case in point, WWII. China is aggressively forging ahead on it’s short-game and it will achieve it unless the US military establishment can develop and use “Third-Eye Technology” to free those among them that have fallen under the loose control of the Chinese. This will result in the realization that secrecy, more than any other single method, facilitates China’s goal. This will result in the unwavering support of complete transparency and totally overt security, which is reliance on the military, as opposed to secret agencies of any kind. The Taliban, who promptly claimed responsibility in a statement to the media just hours after the attack, later said in a separate statement that they had met again on Monday with U.S. representatives to discuss “ending the invasion of Afghanistan” in talks that would continue on Tuesday. They are meeting in Qatar, where the Taliban have a political office.The simultaneousness of the events — the deadly attack, one of the worst Taliban assaults on Afghan forces in recent years — and the Qatar meeting that was meant to pave way for talks aimed at resolving Afghanistan’s 17-year war, underscored the audacity of the insurgents in the face of stepped-up U.S. peace efforts. The Taliban now hold sway in almost half of Afghanistan and carry out attacks on a daily basis, mainly targeting the country’s beleaguered security forces.Sultani, the provincial council member, said that after the bomber’s Humvee exploded, four other attackers engaged in a shootout with Afghan troops. All the attackers were killed, he said. Sultani said there were about 150 military personnel and others at the base at the time. The pro-government militia that was hit had been highly effective in securing the province, especially two important highways linking Kabul with the provinces of Kandahar, Maidan Wardak and Bamyan. “They had participated in so many operations alongside other security forces and had fought against insurgents,” Sultani added.A provincial security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, told the AP that he personally counted as many as 75 dead bodies at the base. There was no official confirmation of this higher toll. Dozens of ambulances took the wounded to the main provincial hospital as well as to Kabul for further treatment, the official said. The blast was so strong that windows of civilian homes seen in the distance from the base were also shattered, he said. A statement from Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s office said the “enemy had carried out a terrorist attack against the intelligence agency’s personnel, killed and wounded a number of honest sons of this homeland who were defending their country and protecting their people.” Ghani also ordered an investigation, the statement added. There was no official breakdown on the casualties or indication how many were members of the militia in training, military or intel personnel.Mirza Mohammad Yarmand, a former deputy interior minister and a military analyst, said the attack was a “tragedy and a big loss to the Afghan security forces.” Yarmand said it was difficult to believe that the country’s vaunted NSD could have lost such a high number of personnel in a single attack and that there must have been serious negligence on someone’s part. He also complained that there were no other checkpoints along the highway and leading up to the base, any one of which could have stopped the vehicle and prevented the bombing.The Taliban statement on Monday said they had met with U.S. representatives to discuss “ending the invasion of Afghanistan” in talks that would continue on Tuesday in Qatar. “Peace talks and negotiations are important and essential for Afghanistan, but not under these unacceptable circumstances,” Yarmand said. “If such attacks continue, there must be a cease-fire agreement first.”Last week, the Taliban threatened to walk away from the talks, accusing Washington of seeking to “expand the agenda” — presumably a reference to American demands that the insurgents hold direct talks with the Kabul government. The Taliban view the Afghan government as a U.S. puppet and have long insisted they will only negotiate directly with Washington. Amid chaos and defiance, Venezuelan opposition faces off against security forces as Maduro digs in By Mariana Zuñiga, Anthony Faiola, Dylan Baddour 2/23/2019SAN ANTONIO, Venezuela —A massive effort to break President Nicolás Maduro’s blockade of humanitarian aid descended into violence and chaos Saturday across the string of border flash points — showing both the growing defiance of the U.S.-backed opposition but also Maduro’s willingness to fight back.In a day of fast-moving developments at various points, anti-Maduro crowds at a Colombian border town faced tear gas fired by Venezuelan units, cheered as dozens of Venezuelan security forces switched sides and tried to rescue desperately needed aid packages from burning trucks. In the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, the embattled Maduro danced at a pro-government rally, mocked the United States and broke off ties with neighboring Colombia — which, for at least one day, became the hub of the resistance as opposition leader Juan Guaidó crossed over Simón Bolívar Bridge to rally supporters. At one point, tear gas fired billowed and protesters responded by throwing rocks at Venezuelan forces. Then a warning cry went up: “Colectivos! Colectivos!” — the name for pro-Maduro vigilantes. Suddenly, a group of 20 large men on motorbikes, their faces partially covered by black masks, roared into the road. They were members of the feared pro-government militias, frequently deployed by Maduro’s loyalists, and who were widely blamed by the opposition for unleashing a torrent of fear at multiple border points on Saturday. Protesters, aid workers, volunteers and journalists began running for shelter, dashing into buildings and cars and boarding motorcycles in an attempt to escape, as the militia members opened fire.             “It was horrifying, horrifying,” said opposition politician Carlos Valero, who was present for the San Antonio attacks. “The last thing we imagined was that Nicolás Maduro was going to put out so many irregular forces. They shot at us, and the national guards threw tear gas. We didn’t expect that level of irrationality in response to humanitarian aid.” Yet the attack here came on a day that was always meant to be about provocation as much as aid. Saturday’s operation had been billed by the opposition and its allies in the Trump administration as a pivotal moment in their bid to topple Maduro’s socialists. The attempts to haul in aid from neighboring nations would test the military’s loyalty, they reasoned, by encouraging the armed forces to disobey Maduro’s direct order to keep the aid out. Maduro declared that he is breaking diplomatic relations with Colombia, which has called for his ouster and thrown its support to Guaidó. Maduro ordered Colombian diplomats to leave Caracas within 24 hours. As night fell, Venezuela was assessing the damage from the running battles between civilians and Maduro loyalists. Four people were killed and 24 injured after an attack by a pro-government militia group. At least two aid trucks — apparently attacked by the Venezuelan security forces — went up in flames on western bridges, burning up nutritional supplements for malnourished children and medicines like insulin, morphine and blood pressure pills as volunteers, some in tears, sought to save what they could. One part of the plan partially worked: Roughly 60 members of Maduro’s military and security forces abandoned posts, denounced him and sought refuge with the opposition on Colombian soil. The events spiraled close to the realm of international conflict. On the Simón Bolívar bridge, tear gas volleys and rocks flew from both the Venezuelan and Colombian sides, with Colombian authorities arresting at least two irregular Venezuelan militiamen on the Colombian side of the border. “#MaduroRegime has fired into territory of #Colombia,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), who has closely advised President Trump on Venezuela, tweeted on Saturday. “Receiving reports of injuries after this attack on sovereign Colombian territory. The United States WILL help Colombia confront any aggression against them.” Maduro, meanwhile, held court during a pro-government rally in the capital of Caracas, at one point breaking into dance with wife on a stage before thousands of cheering supporters. He took the occasion to chide his rival, Guaidó. “I formally challenge you to call for elections, you clown,” Maduro said, “to see who has the votes and who wins elections, — you clown, you beggar, you puppet of imperialism.” Maduro added: “I am stronger than ever, stronger, and standing, governing for the homeland, today and for many years to come.” A convoy of 14 trucks bearing 280 tons of aid was being prepped near a warehouse loading dock here in Cucutá, where thousands of volunteers had camped overnight following a massive benefit concert for Venezuela put on by British billionaire Richard Branson. Guaidó — the opposition leader who claimed the nation’s legitimate mantle of power exactly one month ago — was poised to lead an attempt to get the trucks over a bridge where Maduro’s forces had welded containers together to physically block aid from getting across. “Venezuela, the day has arrived in which we will take the step to enter humanitarian aid. From our borders, by land and sea, we will bring hope, food and medicines for the ones who need it the most,” Guaidó tweeted Saturday. “We call everyone to go out massively to the streets in the whole country, to protest in peace at barracks, to urge the armed forces to let humanitarian aid in.” In Venezuela, groups of volunteers and opposition leaders boarded early-morning buses, cars and motorbikes en route to the eastern Colombian border. In addition to vows of bringing in aid by sea and land — and via human chain if necessary — the opposition also planned large-scale rallies in cities nationwide to demand the admittance of international relief. “I’m very concerned with the information we’ve received about paramilitary groups and other irregular groups already at the border with the intention to spread violence,” said opposition politician Nora Bracho. “We have no doubt that there will be violence, absolutely no doubt.” In defiance of a ban against leaving the country, Guaidó made a secretive trip to Colombia on Friday to lead the aid effort and meet with regional leaders. He suggested the Venezuelan armed forces had helped him spirit across his nation’s western frontier. But he was also running the risk of being barred from reentry or arrested upon return. The attention on Saturday remained focused on the single largest staging ground for aid in Cucutá. Organizers in Cucutá had called for “every available Venezuelan” to turn up Saturday morning at 8 a.m. and await further orders. Many began to awake before dawn on a rocky ground of a camp set up for them and began moving toward arranged meeting points to join the effort. “We’re betting everything on this,” said Ricardo Justo, a 24-year-old salesman from Caracas who traveled 27 hours in bus with a group of 30. “We’ll do whatever they tell us to.” Overnight, Lester Toledo, head of Guaidó’s delegation in Cucutá, addressed the crowd, telling them to have faith that the Venezuelan border guards would let them pass. Volunteers said they were prepared to make a leap of faith. “What else can we do? I’ll fight until I can’t fight anymore,” said José Antonio Pérez, 24, a health worker from nearby San Antonio. “This is the most anticipated day ever in Venezuela.” Venezuelan opposition officials say they’ll be at each border crossing to meet protesters and give further instructions. The opposition leaders assured their supporters that they, and not the volunteers, would walk out front when they confronted Maduro’s border guards. Mari Rivera, 46, a Venezuelan living in Cucutá, said she believes they have enough people to push the shipping containers over. If not, she said, they’ll take the aid under the bridge and through a shallow river.  Air raid sirens on bull horns awoke the camp at 5:20 a.m., rousing them for a day of action. Folk music began playing. Kleibysad Saab, a 47-year-old Venezuelan from the state of Carabobo, lead a crowd in chants of “freedom” before offering a prayer. “No man can close the doors that God has opened,” she said. “Here we go!” The crowd roared an amen. A-AMEN, AMEN, AMEN! A-AMEN, AMEN, AMEN!Eduardo Espinel, a Venezuelan opposition politician, said the opposition would try to move aid over the border via human chains if truck convoys could not get through. William Barrientos, an opposition politician trying to get to the border from San Cristóbal, said that colectivos had already begun attacking buses overnight. “Colectivos attacked one of the buses with our colleagues and took everything from them,” he said. He said the opposition would seek to overwhelm Maduro’s forces through sheer numbers, vowing that the military would need to use force on an equally massive scale to stop them. “And if they do, it would be a genocide,” he said. Even Maduro’s foreign minister, Arreaza, sounded a note of alarm, though he said the opposition would seek to falsely blame the government for violence that it might start. “We are worried that a situation to lament will take place tomorrow because there’s many Colombian military groups at the border,” he said. “Never would the armed forces shoot against the people . . . We hope reason reigns and that this doesn’t end up being a show to open the doors for a military intervention.” If we can’t stand up to Russia, China and Maduro by sending aircraft carriers into the Caribbean with the warning that peace-keeping forces will be coming ashore and across the borders to escort humanitarian aid into Venezuela we have failed before we even begin to restore democracy in the western hemisphere. Trump Serves Americans By Condemning Venezuela’s MaduroRobert Wasinger - The Daily Caller - Tuesday, February 19, 2019President Trump delivered a damning warning to Venezuela’s military in his Monday speech: drop Nicolas Maduro or lose everything. Trump’s tough talk has followed decisive action as the president deploys sanctions and other economic measures to send Maduro packing. Despite this strong posture, the administration’s critics have argued total withdrawal from America’s global commitments.Don’t let these attacks confuse you. President Trump is restoring a much-needed dose of sanity to our foreign policy. The interests of average Americans are once again being put first in lieu of the global and political elite. To be clear, this shift in priorities is precisely why the president has met such resistance within the U.S. foreign policy community. Establishment-backed nonprofits and international institutions like the United Nations have  advocated for a foreign policy that benefits the few over the many.These policies led to disaster. Policies like putting Saddam Hussein in control of Iraq! The CIA is ready to try something different this time. Yeah, just pull out and let Iran take over. That’s an intelligent idea.Botched occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan which sacrificed countless lives and trillions of dollars in treasure. President Obama’s Nuclear Deal which sent hundreds of billions back to the radical Islamist regime in Iran and threw the Middle East into turmoil. And empowered China both economically and militarily at the expense of our traditional allies in Asia. Despite these shortcomings, the establishment of both political parties was happy to stay the course. In an attempt to defend this outdated agenda, critics have reeled against President Trump’s “America first” agenda by labeling him an isolationist. And yet, President Trump’s actions have thrown that accusation on its face. Stringent sanctions have been placed back on the Iranian regime and Tehran’s radical Islamist proxies are being confronted across the Middle East. ISIS has lost nearly 98 percent of its territory mostly since the president took office. The Trump administration has also dramatically increased the number of freedom-of-navigation patrols in the South China Sea and hounded Beijing for its unfair trading practices. Don’t forget; Russia hasn’t gotten off easy either. President Trump upended Obama’s ban on lethal weapons to Ukraine by selling high-powered snipers and Javelin rockets and increased non-lethal aid to Kiev. Rather than recognize these victories, the establishment has worked to paint President Trump as favoring America in retreat. Funny enough, his critics have tried to color him on the other side of the spectrum in regard to Venezuela. Now, President Trump is no longer an isolationist, but a neoconservative warmonger working to remove the innocent Maduro from power. Clearly, this is not the case. Several things should be pointed out to help folks better understand the underlying American interests that are represented by disposing of the horrible Maduro regime.First, the economic and social chaos of the Maduro government is a dramatic rebuke to the socialist fever dreams of the American left. A nation rich in natural resources has been turned into an economic and political basket case with millions of refugees fleeing Maduro’s socialist paradise. Paging Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The Venezuelan people have seen your future and it does not work. The cognitive dissonance of the left is always shocking; but seldom as much so as in this case. In fact, it’s unsurprising, that some American progressives are embracing a leader who practices what they preach. Furthermore, it is clear that a Venezuela in turmoil isn’t in the interest of the U.S. or its allies in the region. America is already hosting more than 300,000 Venezuelans immigrants who have fled due to Maduro’s left-wing policies.Worse, Colombia, an important U.S. ally in the region, may host as many as four million Venezuelan refugees by 2021 if the situation is not under control. Overwhelming Colombia with migrants would only hinder America’s ability to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking operations. Brazil is also experiencing its own woes due to the situation in Venezuela. Venezuela’s regime is also no friend to the American people. Maduro allows his country to host members of the radical Islamist terrorist organization Hezbollah, the group responsible for killing hundreds of American soldiers in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.Still, the resistance and criticism you hear in the media can be expected to persist as long as Trump continues to place the interests of the American people before those of the establishment and global elite. Because they believe that they know better than the American people who elected a president to put their interests first.Robert Wasinger (@RobertWasinger) served in senior advisory and liaison roles on President Trump’s campaign and transition team. The Daily Caller.           Mr. President, honestly sir, our intelligence community and the “Deep State” has us over a barrel, only you can give the orders for Mike Pompeo to shutter embassies worldwide, and to bring the diplomats and staff home. Only you can find out if the FBI and CIA are loyal to the Commander and Chief of the United States of America by ordering them all to return stateside with the embassy personnel. By hiring a private contractor experienced in analyzing large quantities of incoming information such as Cerberus in a contract that explicitly requires that Cerberus livestream all official business to you and both intelligence oversight committees of Congress, as well as, the pentagon with the understanding that the interviewing of all refugees as family units on video tape will be the sole source of intelligence to be analyzed, you will be getting far more reliable information than the $81 billion/year Intelligence Community is giving you. It should also be explicit in the contract that Cerberus will give recommendations for multiple sources of border security in Iraq and Afghanistan based on the analysis of videotaped interviews with refugees. You may be surprised to find that Nancy Pelosi really likes the idea.Mr. President it would be really great if you could get Jason Chaffetz as Chief Strategist in charge of handling the blow back from firing all 2.2 million federal employees and Chris Christie as Chief of Staff. Both would be a huge help in getting bipartisan support. You need to meet with the leaders in Congress to give them a heads up on using the military as a peace keeping force in Venezuela and also request bipartisan support for ending the fighting in Yemen to bring humanitarian aid there as well. Now that the Crown Prince is in China it is time to consider going public with the warning that Cerberus will also be hired to look more closely at the Crown Prince’s level of involvement in the gruesome assassination at the consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 of the author Jamal Khashoggi by agents of the Saudi Arabian government. Ending the fighting in Yemen and hiring Cerberus to look more deeply into the murder of Mr. Khashoggi will give you fabulous bipartisan support that you must test the extent of right away. You need to explain that you want start welcoming all people across the border to interview them to better understand the problems in Guatemala and Honduras but you also like to offer men and women under the age of fifty to join the military to begin assembling companies of Guatemalan and Honduran troops so that they can return home under your command to restore democracy in their homeland. This will require doubling budget of the military because you need to do the same thing with the refugees coming back to Iraq and Afghanistan. You should make sure that all detainees brought into Iraq from Syria see the new kind of democracy you are establishing in Iraq Frankly sir, Mr. Maduro has made it clear that he is not going to do things the easy way by accepting amnesty for himself and his generals so, unless the pressure he will feel from the families of his facing deportation brings quick results, it is time to do this the hard way by arresting him and all of those in his government that are suspected of crimes.  As I have said before, you should assure the leaders of Congress that although you will be letting all federal employees go you will not do anything to hinder Mueller. Tell them that you will have Turbo Tax experts and other computerized tax businesses handle tax returns. Also assure them that the National Guard will have orders to higher all displaced federal employees immediately on the pay role and send them to the border video tape interviews of family units or individuals, all of which will be welcome as long as they voluntarily stay in tent cities. All of those who want a job working on the border should be hired to clear brush along the border. Iraq: Iraqi’s killed protesting the election of Iranians to office!Iraqis protest the growing Iranian influence in the country : The pro-Iranian militias and their political representatives blame the US and Saudi Arabia for the unrest in Basra. By Jonathan Spyer 9/15/2018 Israeli PostOver the past week, violent protests have swept the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Twelve people have been killed in the protests and hundreds injured. The protests focused on the dire living conditions in the city, which is located in a province that is home to 70% of Iraq’s oil reserves. Corruption and chronic mismanagement have produced a daily reality of electricity shortages, lack of drinking water, and high unemployment. There are fears of a cholera outbreak resulting from poor sanitary conditions. Thirty thousand people have been hospitalized after drinking polluted water in recent weeks. The protests are a violent reaction to all this. No coherent demands or united leadership have yet emerged. But the attacks do not appear to be entirely random.According to the Arabic-language Asharq al-Awsat newspaper, “Protesters set fire to the building of the neighboring provincial council and a number of party and faction headquarters, including the headquarters of the ruling Dawa Party, the Islamic Supreme Council, the Badr Organization – the largest Shi’ite armed group supported by Iran in Iraq, the headquarters of the Brigades of Imam Ali, and Asaib Ahl al-Haq, led by Qais al-Khazali, and the movement of the former deputy leader Hanan al-Fatlawi. The protesters also attacked offices of the state-run Al-Iraqiya TV and the office of the al-Furat channel of Hakam al-Hakamah, led by Ammar al-Hakim.” In addition, protesters attacked the facilities of the Ktaeb Hezbollah, Khorasani and Hezbollah al-Nujaba militias. With the exception of the TV channel, all the above-mentioned targets have one thing in common – they are all clients or proxies of the Iranian regime in Iraq. This orientation of the protests culminated in the burning of the Iranian Consulate in Basra by protesters on Friday, September 7. Protesters chanted “Iran out, Basra remains free,” according to a report in Gulf News. It is worth noting that Basra is a largely Shia city. The protests were not sectarian in nature. The demonstrators were evidently acting upon a simple and entirely accurate calculation: the situation in the city is intolerable. Those in power are to blame. And the visible power in Iraq today, particularly in the majority-Shia Basra Governorate, is Iran. The demonstrators in Basra evidently understand something about their country that remains elusive to much Western commentary. In the aftermath of the military defeat of Islamic State in Iraq, a narrative became widespread in the Western media that a strong and independent Iraqi state was reasserting itself. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was depicted as the leader who had brought Iraq back together. He had, according to this view, defeated the Sunni Arab/jihadi challenge to Iraqi sovereignty posed by Islamic State. He had then defeated Kurdish hopes of secession in late 2017, forcing the Kurds back into the Iraqi fold by force (and dismissing the results of their referendum, in which 93% had opted to leave the country). Abadi, according to this telling, would now move forward heading a new government to focus on the pressing matters of governance facing his newly reunited country. Unfortunately, it turns out that much or most of this is illusion. The May 12 elections resulted not in a victory for Abadi’s prematurely named Nasr (Victory) list. Rather, Moqtada al-Sadr’s Sairoun group, running specifically on an Iraqi nationalist platform seeking to distance the country from both Tehran and the US, emerged with the largest parliamentary representation. The second-largest was the pro-Iranian Fatah list of Hadi al-Ameri. Abadi came in third. The subsequent coalition negotiations have resulted in a deadlock. Mr. Trump, can you imagine if you had to try to run this country if it were a parliament and a coalition government with Adam Schiff as Prime Minister? Parliamentary governments have the divide and conquer issue built right in. This is an untenable situation for nascent democracies while China is operating as the master infiltrator in the world through its puppet states, Iran and Russia. You have the opportunity to point this out to the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan and get them to allow the people to elect one leader as president. This is only one aspect of how democracy is weakened from the start. Our own country is suffering from the effects of allowing secret agencies to exist.But in any case, it is clear that even if a coalition dominated by Sadr and Abadi eventually emerges, the independent Iran-directed military power of the Shia militias will remain. The pro-Iranian militias and their political representatives blame the US and Saudi Arabia for the unrest in Basra. There are indications that they are preparing their own violent response. On September 7, three mortar shells were fired at Baghdad’s Green Zone, the center of Iraqi government institutions and associated with the US presence in Iraq. The Iran-supported Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia has claimed responsibility for the attack. It came just two days after a statement by Iran-supported militias promising to strike at US targets in the country. The statement read: “We look with anger at the illegal military presence of foreign forces in Iraq under any name, and we state clearly that our patience is limited and that we will deal with them as an occupying force, and it is our legitimate right to use all means to get it out of our country.” Ameri has also threatened to “overthrow” any “collaborating” government formed with US assistance “within two months.” So, what is taking place within Iraq is a sharp polarization against a backdrop of political deadlock. THE EVENTS in Basra appear to reflect popular anger against Iran’s de facto power in Iraq. But the militias and their Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) backers are unlikely to be deterred or made to change course by popular unrest. Rather, the signs are they will dig in and mobilize their own counterforce. In the by now familiar pattern of Iranian penetration of neighboring countries, political and military activity will complement each other. The ultimate threat of independently wielded force will lie behind all political moves. The latest evidence suggests that as the US-Iran confrontation grows in intensity, so the curtain dividing the Iranian state from its proxies is growing increasingly frayed. Both the US and Israel are today involved in a region-wide attempt to contain and roll back the Iranian advances of recent years. Iraq is one of the arenas in which Iran is at its strongest, and where it is evidently determined to resist any attempt to push it back. Over the weekend, as the riots in Basra raged and the mortar shells landed on the Green Zone, Iran launched seven ballistic missiles at the offices of two Iranian Kurdish parties on Iraqi soil, near the town of Koya. The strike killed 18 people and wounded another 49, according to a report on the Kurdistan 24 news website. The IRGC has since claimed responsibility. It was an open display of contempt for the very Iraqi sovereignty whose return was lauded not so long ago by Abadi’s promoters in the West. Iran regards Iraq not as a country, but as a territory within which it wields power both openly and by proxy. Tehran also evidently views Iraq as an ideal territory to begin the pushback against the US and allied moves against it of recent months. As this contest intensifies in the period ahead, the country looks set to experience further instability. Iraq’s Importance to The Survival Of Iran’s Regime And Economy Following U.S. Sanctions By A. Savyon, MEMRI 1/15/2019 ISRAPUNDIT As the impact of the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s economy increases, after even countries that oppose U.S. policy are complying with them, Iraq’s importance to the survival of Iran’s regime and economy also increases. Underlining Iraq’s importance to Iran, Sadollah Zarei, who is on the editorial board of the regime mouthpiece Kayhan, wrote in a January 23, 2019 article: “America imagines that it will weaken the government of Iraq, and particularly the situation of [Iraqi Prime Minister] Adil Abdul-Mahdi, with military pressure in northern and southern Iraq, to the point where it [Iraq] will be unable to carry the burden of the warm and extensive Baghdad-Tehran relations. On the other hand, [the U.S.] will [also] create insecurity for the Iranian regime in two areas of Iranian investment. America knows that Iran has made important investments in the last 15 years in [Iraq’s] provinces of Sulaymaniyah, Erbil, Basra, Nasiriyah, and others, and that it [Iran] has become an important partner of Iraq, particularly in the energy sector. “From the Americans’ point of view, if Iran reaches energy agreements with even one or two of its neighbors, the American sanctions will not be able to block Iran’s energy [export] route. Therefore, severing Iraq’s relations with Iran is a strategic need for Washington.” It appears that the Iranian regime is pursuing this path because Iranian hegemony over Iraq will allow Iran to export oil via Iraq, and to obtain goods in exchange, with no need for banks or dollars – thus circumventing the U.S. sanctions. In this way, Iran’s regime can continue to exist, as can its expansion in the region. This is the context in which Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif’s recent special visit to Iraq must be understood. Bringing Iraq into the Iran-led Shi’ite resistance axis is an important political and economic aim for the Iranian regime, as noted by Sayed Hadi Afaqhi, an Iranian expert on the region who writes commentary and analysis of events for websites identified with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). In a January 18, 2019 interview with the Mehr news agency, Afaqhi analyzed Zarif’s Iraq visit, saying: “Iraq is considered a very important country for Iran in many areas, and it can strengthen the resistance front in the region. This is why we are sensitive towards Iraq, and therefore we must not allow control of this country to be in the hands of America, the Zionist regime, and some of the reactionary Arab [states] of the region [hinting at Saudi Arabia]. Unfortunately, our economic activity in Iraq is weak, but Iran’s advisory activity, [as part of which] we hastened to help the Iraqi military forces so that they could fight the terrorists at the time when there was a terrorist-group presence on Iraqi soil, was positive. In order to establish strategic trade agreements with Iraq, we must first set out a strategic plan and document. Iran should be [the country that is] at least second, after Russia, in rebuilding Syria, especially in light of Iraq’s current situation, as it advances in its own rehabilitation towards stability and security. But for us, Iraq is [even] more important than Syria, and this is because of the long Iran-Iraq border.” Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif To Islamic Resistance Groups in Iraq: The American Era Is Over; “We Are Enamored of Iraq’s Rehabilitation; As We Fought Alongside Al-Hashd Al-Sha’bi And the Iraqi Armed Forces, So Are We Willing to Participate in Rebuilding Iraq”On January 13, 2019, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif arrived in Iraq at the head of a large political and economic delegation for a five-day visit, a few days after a visit there by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. During his visit, Zarif met with Iraqi officials from the political, economic, and religious sectors, including Shi’ites, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkmens, and others. The meetings took place in the capital Baghdad, in the Kurdish cities of Erbil and Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq, and in the Shi’ite cities of Najaf and Karbala in the south. The aim of the visit, according to the Iranian news agencies Mehr and Tasnim, was, inter alia, to discuss Iranian investments in Iraq, Iran’s participation in rebuilding Iraq, and strengthening Iran-Iraq economic cooperation, in light of Iran’s increasing economic difficulties due in particular to the U.S. sanctions against it. On January 16, in a speech to representatives of Islamic resistance groups in Karbala, Zarif underlined the Iran-Iraq partnership as well as the anti-U.S. and anti-West Iranian revolutionary Islamic ideology that he said Iraq too should take upon itself in order for it to rebuild itself economically and politically. In statements in Karbala to representatives of resistance groups, Zarif, who is perceived by the West as a moderate figure in the Iranian regime along with President Hassan Rohani, underlined how very important Iran considers exporting the Islamic revolution to Iraq, harnessing Iraq’s economy for the needs of Iran’s struggling economy, and expanding Iran’s political influence in the region. He acknowledged that Iranian forces had fought alongside the pro-Iran Iraqi militias against the Islamic State (ISIS) despite Iranian regime officials’ vehement denials that Iranian fighters were involved in fighting in other countries and their claims that only Iranian advisors were in those countries. Another important element of his statements was the common struggle against those he perceives as the enemies of Islam – the U.S. and the West. The following are Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif’s statements in Karbala to representatives of resistance groups: “What took place in Iraq in the last three or four years is another sign that if we rely on God, and on our capability, there is a possibility that, under the direction of a first-degree cleric [a reference to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei], we can overcome every problem. The secret of America’s pressure on Iran and Iraq in this era is that we and you are acting on this fact, and America greatly fears this and our internalization of it. “Everyone has perhaps heard of the well-known story of the naked emperor. This emperor had no clothes on, and everyone told [him], despite reality, that he was dressed. The emperor accepted this, contrary to reality, until one day a little boy told him that he was naked.  This truth shook the pillars of heaven… America wants us to believe that the emperor is clothed even though he is in fact naked, and when someone utters the truth, [America] pressures him so that he ends up agreeing that the emperor is indeed not naked. “The truth is that the era in which America sat in God’s place is over. But few dare to talk about this or to act on it. As long as no one dares to speak out against this, America can control the world without using any force at all, because this method is the cheapest for it. But if someone in this era wants to challenge this illusion, he will be pressured until he accepts America’s might and false control.“American President [Trump] said that [the U.S.] has spent $7 trillion in Iraq with no achievements. In the end, he was forced to arrive at and leave the American air force base in the dead of night. His friends had to turn around when they were only half way to Iraq. All this is evidence of the real [state] of America.Zarif. Source: Tasnim, Iran, January 16, 2018.“Our transgression, and yours – the Iraqi nation’s – is that we are saying that the emperor is naked. We must be prepared to come under pressure for uttering this truth. Whatever the pressure may be, it will not change the truth. “The Americans claim that they defeated ISIS. But we know, and you know, that they never fought to vanquish anyone, and that if America ever did anything in that war, it either helped ISIS or transferred the ISIS men, after they were defeated in Iraq and Syria, to Afghanistan… Therefore, we and you are under pressure to say the opposite of the truth – that the emperor is not naked, or that we think he is clothed – [but] if we [actually] believe this, we will also have to obey America. My dears, the truth is that America’s time is over. This does not mean that America will fall, but that it will no longer be able to lead the world.“My dears! We must see the reality as it is so that we can act on it. Perhaps a century ago all the important events in the world took place in the West; perhaps 20 years ago, the West led or directed everything that happened. But today everything that happens certainly does not happen in the West and is not directed by it. The obvious example of this is that the American and Russian foreign ministers both announced, in September 2016, a ceasefire in Syria, but two weeks later, the fighting in Syria began again. That is, not everything that America and Russia decide actually takes place. Three months later, Iran, Russia, and Turkey decided that there would be a ceasefire in Syria, and for two years there has been a ceasefire in Syria.  America is pressuring the UN to declare that the Astana process has failed, because this process reveals that the emperor is naked.“We, before anyone else, must accept and internalize the truth that America is no longer a superpower that can control [others]. As of today, there is only one superpower in the world, and that is God and those who believe in Him.“This, today, is the truth in the world. Three years ago, I wrote, as a university lecturer, a book titled Transition in International Relations of the Post-Western World. The claim [made in the title] is not mere words but is scientific reality. In fact, you, the Iraqi people, have proven that it is not America that vanquished ISIS, but [the pro-Iran Iraqi Shi’ite militia] Al-Hashd Al-Sha’bi, the resistance groups, and the Iraqi armed forces. It is funny that they say that America defeated ISIS with [only] 20 [bombing] sorties. The truth is that the regime of America today is a regime that exists [only] in the mind  – that is, the world thinks that America still has the glory and the rule. The same truth applies to industry and economy. Where is the world that America rebuilt after World War II, besides Europe? And now it wants to rebuild Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. “Any American or even European company that wants to come to Iraq will spend more on security than it will on the [rehabilitation] project. But any Iranian company that wants to work in Iraq will not only see its maximum outlay fall, but it will be working out of love for the Imam Hossein. “We are enamored of Iraq’s rehabilitation. As we fought alongside Al-Hashd Al-Shabi and the Iraqi armed forces, so are we willing to participate in rebuilding Iraq. The truth is that Iraq’s entire upper echelon is committed to expanding [Iraq-]Iran cooperation, [and therefore] the minor officials in Iraq must internalize this truth. Our problem in Iraq is that the upper echelon has a good grasp of reality, but in the middle and lower ranks, fear of America’s might create problems for developing [Iran-Iraq] relations.” Zarif is received in Erbil by Iraqi Kurdistan (KRG) Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani. Source: Tasnimnews.com, January 15, 2019. Iran: Poor, Poor Pitiful Us 10/5/2018 The Strategy Page: The News as HistoryIran has had more than its share of setbacks recently. In Iraq the new government finally came together. Iran failed to get its preferred politicians into key positions. In effect, the Iranians have some influence but are far from “controlling Iraq.” Iran is also having trouble convincing anyone that it can control access to the Persian Gulf. Since the American revived their sanctions last March Iran has threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz or, at the very least, assert control over the Straits of Hormuz. Iran has run into problems with both of these claims. Since March the United States had moved military forces into the Gulf region to deal with any Iranian efforts to close the Straits of Hormuz. This effort gained added impact because even China is opposed to Iranian threats to close the straits. The U.S. also noted that its current military posture in the Gulf had put an end to Iranian harassment of U.S. warships. There had been 22 of those incidents in 2015, 36 in 2016 but only 14 in 2017 and none so far in 2018. Iran has published some videos of 2018 harassment incidents, but the Iranians are not nearly as bold as they were in the past and will back off quickly if challenged.The Iranian government continues to be challenged by its own people. The large anti-government demonstrations continue, and opinion polls confirm that most Iranians are fed up with their government and want change. So far, the government has not shown much interest in changing. That’s the official line, as provided by the senior clerics who hold the ultimate power. As long as the IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) remains loyal and reliable the population can be kept in line using threats, or applications, of force. Less popular support means an even less effective economy. That also means less of everything, including military power and the ability to keep secrets. The IRGC and police discovered this as they investigated the Israeli theft of the Iranian nuclear weapons archive earlier this year. Officially Iran denies this ever happened. In reality, the government and IRGC leaders were furious and demanded answers. The investigation found or rediscovered, that many Iranians are willing to take a bribe to provide information to just about anyone (including Israeli secret agents) and cooperate in other ways. In short, the archive heist was not an exceptional undertaking. It could happen again and, given the current widespread anger towards the government, it would probably be easier and cheaper. (You don’t need secret agents or to pay for information, all that needs to be done is to video interviews of the ISIS refugees and detainees from Syria that will be more than willing to share any information they have in exchange for asylum in northern Iraq.) (We must advise them that a Parliament is merely a steppingstone to a politburo. Furthermore, we must advise them that avoiding being centralized by granting sovereignty over the people to the county level makes their democracy stronger by making it more efficient. Having a separate state within Iraq for the Kurds in the north with its own constitution further strengthens their democracy through greater decentralization and better representation for different ethnic groups. This is the reason that separation of Church and State is an absolute must in their national constitution because there are different ethnic groups. Secrecy of any kind must be strictly and explicitly in conflict with the national constitution. Total transparency must be a constitutional requirement of the national constitution for all state constitutions. By advising those that are elected locally that will be meeting in the capitol to form the government that we have learned that secrecy of any kind opens the door for China to undermine whatever kind of government they choose for themselves they will be in full agreement because they have lived with the complexity of contradictions between what the CIA and FBI have put them through for decades and the way our democracy works, which is what they want.  If they will accept these three main precepts: Freedom of religion or separation of church and state. Avoiding excessive centralization by granting sovereignty over the people to the county and not allowing any governing bodies smaller than the county. Making secrecy of any kind unconstitutional in the national constitution and requiring that all state constitutions call for complete transparency they will become a strong enough democratic republic that the US can leave with confidence that they will remain free and strong for years rather than weeks and this is what we want What we don’t want and what we must not allow, is to leave Iraq or Afghanistan while they are so weak that they are just a vacuum laid wide open to being overrun by terrorist organizations. It seems clear now that the Taliban are insurgents in Afghanistan wanting to impose an Iran-like Islamic dictatorship and not the freedom fighters that the Reagan administration were misled into backing,)Speaking of loyalty. Iran is finding less of it from its allies in Syria. Russia, Turkey and the Assad government see the continuing Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria as a matter between Israel and Iran. The obsession with destroying Israel is seen as an Iranian weakness. Although Russia, Turkey and Iraq are technically allied with Iran in Syria, the historical record shows Iran is usually the enemy of these three nations and that has been the case for centuries, long before Israel came along in 1948. One thing everyone can agree on is the need to get rid of the remaining Islamic terrorist rebel groups in Syria. Most of these are currently surrounded in the northwest Syrian province of Idlib. There are some ISIL (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) groups hiding out in eastern Syria but these are seen as much less of a threat than the tens of thousands of Islamic terrorists in Idlib. Everyone in and bordering Syria would like to see the Iranians go back to Iran and stay there. The few hundred Iranian troops and over 50,000 Iranian mercenaries in Syria are seen as a constant source of trouble. Iran realizes that their allies in Syria have, and will probably continue, to collaborate with Israel if an opportunity presents itself. Yet Iranian leaders fail to see the absurdity of this situation and despite widespread popular protest against them, the Syrian operations continues to operate like its forces in Syria are on the verge of destroying Israel.  “Everyone in and bordering Syria would like to see the Iranians go back to Iran and stay there.” Discussions continue on how Russia, Iran and Turkey will operate in Syria once the civil war is officially over. That will happen even before Idlib is back under Syrian government control. Because there are over 50,000 armed rebels in Idlib and fewer than 100,000 Syrian troops and Iranian mercenaries available for Idlib operations morale is not high among the attackers, especially the Syrian troops. Turkey is offering a solution that means many of the Islamic terrorists in Idlib would get away and there is not a lot of opposition to that from Russia, Iran and Turkey. Syria is negotiating peace deals with Kurds (who control the northeast), Druze (who occupy much of the Israeli-Jordan border) and Sunni groups (tribal leaders and local leaders who have not been hostile). Syria wants to attract a lot of foreign aid for reconstruction but that is complicated by Iranian plans to establish a permanent military presence and continue threatening Israel. Several members of the Assad clan are facing war crimes charges and Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan want to send back several million Sunni Arab refugees (which the Assads do not want). The war will not end quickly or in a tidy fashion.Danger in The East Pakistan continuing to support the drug gangs and Taliban in Afghanistan while assisting the U.S. in its “war on terror.” Many Americans want to just leave. The problem is just getting out leaves Afghanistan at the mercy of Pakistan, Iran and Russia, as well as all the drug gangs, Islamic terror groups and numerous Afghans who oppose the drugs and all the outside interference. The drugs and Islamic terrorism will still be major exports. The West can leave Afghanistan, but the ills of Afghanistan won’t leave the West and that is just fine with Pakistan. Iran believes it would have more influence on Afghanistan with the Americans gone and that is another reason why so many Afghans want the foreign troops to stay.Danger in The West Iranian efforts to dominate Iraq have fallen way short of expectations. Most young Iraqis see no future in Islamic radicalism and terrorism, which has, for most of their young lives been more of a threat than a source of salvation. Down in Basra the ongoing riots and demonstrations are about basics, like clean water and regular electricity supplies. The Basra unrest has been going on for ten weeks and at least 25 protestors have been killed and many more wounded or arrested. Dozens have disappeared and feared dead. The protesters note that Iran backed militias are also involved in attacking the demonstrators. This, for many young Iraqis, confirms suspicions that Iran is not their friend. The government has promised to improve living conditions in Basra but that is slow in coming.Iraqi anti-government demonstrators were always angry at Iran. In part, this was because of the Iranian backed PMF (Peoples Mobilization Forces) militias in Iraq, whose leaders often speak of imposing a religious dictatorship in Iraq and generally ignored all the corruption. Protestors in Shia majority Basra are also criticizing Iran for halting electricity exports in early July. Iran cut the electricity because corrupt Iraqi officials had not paid for much of it. Moreover, there was an electricity shortage developing in Iran. It was necessary for Iraq to import electricity because for a long time (the Saddam era) there were not many electric power plants in Basra because it was a Shia majority area and Shia were starved for resources before 2003 (when the Sunni Arab minority ruled). But after Saddam was overthrown in 2003 and Shia politicians gained power, corruption prevented the construction of power plants. Iran thought cutting the power, especially since they had a good reason, would increase the anger against the Iraqi government. But the protestors saw through the Iranian intentions and added that to the long list of reasons why Iraqi Shia do not like Iran. After a few weeks Iran restored the electricity exports.The current Iraqi enthusiasm for battling corruption is hurting Iranian efforts to expand its influence inside Iraq. That’s because pro-Iran groups in Iraq have long justified outlaw behavior in order to serve their mentor Iran. This has led to Iraqi army commanders being more aggressive in dealing with Iran backed PMF units. Most of the PMF units were formed in late 2014 to fight ISIL. Since then the PMF has been put on the government payroll, despite the fact that nearly half of them are also supported by Iranian cash and equipment. Since the government began paying PMF militiamen the PMF became part of the defense forces. Technically the army can order PMF units around but until recently the Iran-backed PMF would often ignore those orders. In some cases, PMF commanders would threaten army officers. Given the results of the recent elections (pro-Iran parties did poorly) and the growing popular unrest in Iran attitudes have changed. Iraqi army officers are not just ordering pro-Iran PMF units to back off but using force to make the PMF comply. So far this has not gone much beyond armed confrontations (which often work) and arresting (“kidnapping” according to pro-Iran Iraqis) PMF men who disobey army orders. Apparently, the anti-Iran election results have led to pro-Iran PMF commanders being advised (by Iran) to play nice with the army and back off. This is seen as temporary as there is no sign that pro-Iran PMF groups will cease to take orders from Iran. Iraqis believe the pro-Iran PMF units are backing off as part of an Iranian effort to persuade Iraq to oppose the renewed American economic sanctions on Iran. Iraqi leaders were under a lot of political pressure from Iran to ignore the American sanctions, if only because complying would hurt the Iraqi economy. That pressure caused some hesitation by Iraqi leaders until they realized that most Iraqis preferred the Americans to the Iranians. After all, when Iraq asked the Americans to leave in 2011, they did. Iranians are not very cooperative in that respect and for centuries have been trying to get its way in what is now Iraq.Danger from Above Although Iran has been aware of its serious deficiencies when it comes to air defense for over a decade, nothing it has done so far has made a major difference. Outsiders began to notice Iranian efforts to change that in 2009 when the Iranian Supreme Leader separated most missile-based air defense systems from the air force and organized them into a separate air defense command. Despite vigorous efforts by the new Air Defense Force that did not produce air defenses that could keep up with the potential threats from the many enemies Iran has acquired (especially the U.S., Israel plus the Arab oil states). Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been described as visibly alarmed at the inability of Iran to defend itself against the many enemy aircraft and missiles that could be used in wartime, especially for a surprise attack. Iran has been promising to destroy Israel and the United States since the 1980s and is now trying to take control of Syria and further threaten Israel. In response to that Israel has been fighting back and Iran is uncomfortable about how this is playing out. Khamenei replaced the commander of the air force in August, the fifth senior military commander replaced in the last year. New leaders do not seem to be the solution.The Iranian Air Force is the weakest in the region. Air force commanders complain that, at best, there current warplanes are good for ground attack and little else. Worse, air force commanders admit that the IRGC is opposed to the air force obtaining modern jet fighters. Supreme Leader Khamenei practices what he preaches when it comes to paranoia about enemy air attack. This year the U.S. Air Force, which tracks the positions of Iranian S-300 SAM batteries noted a seemingly random pattern of S-300 movements. After some analysis they found that these movements were not random at all. While Iranian S-300 batteries are deployed to protect a few key areas (like the capital and oil producing areas) the roving S-300 battery was actually following Khamenei around. Whenever he travelled to another Iranian city that lacked S-300 protection, an S-300 battery showed up and then left as soon as Khamenei did.China Makes A Move China is obtaining a larger economic presence in Iran by helping Iran deal with the return of sanctions. The economic problems in Iran are partly the result of the Americans resuming most of sanctions in November, which includes bans on buying Iranian oil. Already Iran is offering discounts to its customers to entice them to defy the Americans. China will seek, and pro-American Asian nations will get exemptions The United States announced this decision in March and that set off a financial panic in Iran, which was already suffering from massive government corruption and decades of mismanagement of the economy.Even China and India, two major customers who said they would defy the sanctions, have cut orders because sanctions will increase shipping costs and also increase the risk of Iran going to war. Sanctions mean the cost of insurance rises and fewer shipping companies are willing to provide tankers to move sanctioned oil. China remains on good terms with Arab oil states and both Iran and the Arabs will sometimes call on China to help set up secret talks between Iranians and Arabs. China has a way of seeing problems (like Iran getting hit by sanctions once more) as opportunities. China is willing to break international law, use bribes, and generally entertain just about any proposition.There have even been proposals for Russia, China, Iran and anyone else interested to establish a separate international payments system based on the Chinese currency (the yuan). But even Chinese bankers will explain (off the record) that this would not work because, compared to  the dollar, the yuan is much less stable and subject to wide and unexpected changes in value (compared to other currencies). One reason the dollar has become the primary currency for foreign trade is because it is the most widely accepted, used and, most importantly, stable of the major currencies. European countries opposed to the resumption of sanctions are establishing a barter system for Iran, to help get around the sanctions. The American see all these moves as fair game for U.S. countermeasures.October 4, 2018: The market (not the official exchange rate) rate for the Iranian currency recently peaked at 190,000 rials to buy one dollar but has now reversed to 140,000. This apparently means the initial panic over the full imposition of sanctions in November is over. Many Iranians and businesses rushed to turn some of their cash assets into dollars and that played a major role in the sharp decline in the value of the rial versus the dollar. Despite that Iranian currency has taken a beating. In 2013 it was 33,000 rials per dollar. Then as now that sort of thing hurts some critical government programs, like health care (which must import most medical supplies and pay for it in dollars). It is much worse now because at the start of 2018 it cost 45,000 rials to buy a dollar and it rapidly got worse as the year went on. The rate rose to 110,000 rials in late July, recovered a bit (to 90,000 rials) in August but after that has been sharply moving in the wrong direction and the government has stopped trying to cope. This is all about the return of economic sanctions. That has forced changes in spending patterns. Before the current crisis the defense budget has skyrocketed to $15 billion in 2017. While that is one of the lowest defense budgets in the region it more than triples when you add money spent on supporting foreign wars (Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Gaza and many smaller operations worldwide). No other nation in the regions spends that much on foreign wars. The fact that Iran keeps spending more on defense and foreign wars is no secret to most Iranians and a primary reason for the continuing protests. Iranians have noticed that spending that directly impacts the lives of ordinary Iranians has gone down and that gets worse as the rial gets weaker. For example, the inflation is now 14 percent, versus less than ten percent (for the first time in 26 years) in early 2017.October 2, 2018: In February the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) agreed to give Iran more time to prove that it is no longer engaged in illegal financial activities that aid Islamic terrorism. Iran was supposed to have complied by now, but it hasn’t, and the final deadline is the end of October. The FATF is threatening to move Iran to the blacklist, with North Korea, and make it very difficult for Iran to use the international banking system. In 2016 FATF suspended such sanctions on Iran for a year so Iran could prove it had shut down these illegal activities by the Iranian government to finance terrorism. The Iranian government tried hard enough to get FATF extensions to that deadline. This may be the last extension because the U.S. and other nations keep providing new evidence that Iran continues to finance terrorism. The Iranian government knows that the problem is; the IRGC continues to do whatever it wants and expects the government to deal with nuisances like the FATF. (Sounds like the way the FBI, CIA, NSA and the rest of the Deep State operates doesn’t it.) The IRGC are religious zealots on a Mission from God (Translation; dupes of China.) and not concerned with whatever FATF is trying to do. This is a problem the Iranian government cannot admit even exists and is finding that getting the IRGC to cooperate does not seem possible either. Neighboring Pakistan is also having similar problems with the FATF. In Pakistan it is the ISI (military intelligence) that is dominated by supporters of Islamic terrorism and reluctant to cooperate. (Translation; dupes of China.)  Pakistan had to prove it was clean otherwise it goes back on the “gray list” of countries who are not doing enough to block terrorist groups from using the international banking system to finance their violence. Pakistan had been on the gray list from 2012 to 2015 and that was bad for businesses that import or export. Pakistan is on the FATF list but not designated as dangerous. Being on the gray portion of the list makes it more expensive to do business and is very bad for the reputation of Pakistan and Pakistanis. China played a major role in keeping Pakistan off the gray list this time, but the odds are against Pakistan staying off the list because it has long been an open secret that Pakistani support for its own pet Islamic terrorists included making it easier for Islamic terrorists, in general, to do business in Pakistan. The United States has been gathering evidence to justify the FATF to put Pakistan back on the gray list (along with Ethiopia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Vanuatu and Tunisia). (Yemen, Iraq and Tunisia all want democracy but are dealing with Iranian Insurgents and we have been on the wrong in Yemen because of our CIA and FBI. Tunisia accepted the wrong help to achieve that goal.)October 1, 2018: For the second time Iran has fired Zulfiqar ballistic missiles from Western Iran at ISIL targets in Syria. This time three missiles were fired, and the press release noted that each had a name; “Death to Israel.” “Death to America” and “Death to the Saud Family.” (The ruling royal family of Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salmon and his father King Muhammad bin Saud.) One missile failed and landed inside Iran and damaged a farm near the Iraqi border. The point of these names was to remind everyone that from western Iran Zulfiqar missiles can hit American bases in Syria (most of which are near the Iraqi border). These missiles can also hit the Saudi capital, although Iran has been trying, without success, to do that since 2016 by firing over a hundred ballistic missiles (with varying ranges) from Yemen into Saudi Arabia. All have been intercepted by Patriot air defense systems. If Iran could operate Zulfiqar from Iraq (dubious considering the current anti-Iran riots) the missiles could reach Israel and be intercepted by Israeli Patriot systems (plus several other air defense systems). The Iranian press release did not mention the failure or interception rates of Zulfiqar and similar Iranian ballistic missiles. The last time Iran fired missiles at Syrian targets was in June 2017 when six Zulfiqar ballistic missiles were fired at ISIL targets in Palmyra and Deir Ezzor. Only two of the missiles hit anything of value but some of them traveled about 620 kilometers. Four apparently landed in western Iraq. Iran denied these Israeli claims about accuracy and Israel dismissed the denials as more Iranian posturing. This public disagreement went on for a week and the Israelis did not back down with their claims that the Iranian missiles performed poorly. For a nation constantly threatened with attack by Iranian ballistic missiles the Israeli observation of the Zulfiqar performance is yet another embarrassment for Iran. The Iranian media described (and published pictures) of the Zulfiqar ballistic missile. This appeared to be another version of the Fateh-110 which is a 3.5-ton, solid fuel ballistic missile with a range of 250 kilometers and a half ton warhead. Iran first revealed Fateh-110 in 2002. These missiles were also manufactured in Syria (as the M-600). The Iranian version appeared to be based on the Chinese DF-11, which entered service in 1979 and continues to be used by China and was exported to Pakistan. The DF-11 (also known as the M11) is a single stage solid fuel missile that weighs 4.2 tons, has a range of 300 kilometers and carries a .8-ton warhead. By 2011 there were reports of a DF-11A which used a smaller warhead and larger solid fuel to achieve a range of over 700 kilometers. Several years later an update of the DF-11A entered service with a more accurate and reliable guidance system. This is a missile quite similar to the Zulfiqar, which Iran announced in 2016. So far, no Zulfiqars have been sent to Syria or Lebanon. In 2013 Iran was found to be airlifting more Fateh-110s to Syria, apparently meant for Hezbollah. These longer-range missiles, that can reach all of Israel’s major cities, are a primary target for Israeli forces in any future war with Hezbollah and some were destroyed during at least one of the recent Israeli air strikes in Syria.The 2017 Iranian ballistic missile attack was in response to a recent attack in the Iranian capital by six ISIL men armed with firearms and explosive vests. The attack went after two targets; the parliament (in central Tehran) and a shrine to religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (who established the current religious dictatorship) south of Tehran. All six attackers were killed but not before seven other people died and 43 wounded. It was soon discovered five of the dead ISIL men were Iranians who police knew or suspected had left the country to join ISIL. The five apparently returned to set up an ISIL branch in Iran and ISIL boasts that this is the first attack of many in Iran.September 30, 2018: Iran has transferred ownership of four new cargo (container) ships to a Chinese company that does a lot of business with Iran. This transfer is apparently an effort to avoid the impact of sanctions. China has always been helpful to Iran in that respect.September 29, 2018: The United States announced that it is temporarily shutting down its consulate in Basra (southern Iraq) because of growing threats from local pro-Iran groups to launch a major attack on the consulate. The consulate has been subject to some recent rocket attacks and American intel indicates some pro-Iranian Shia militias in the area are being encouraged by Iran to be more aggressive.September 27, 2018: In the southern city of Shiraz police arrested a local public relations official in an effort to discover how a large billboard, meant to honor Iranian soldiers who died in action, used a photo of Israeli soldiers. Worse, the photo originally had four soldiers with their backs to the camera and one of them was obviously a woman. She was photoshopped out of the original, which was available on the Internet. The four soldiers are wearing Israeli uniforms and two have their M16 rifles slung across their backs and are easy to identify. Iranian soldiers have never used the M16. The billboard was taken down overnight and now the police want the public relations official in charge of putting the original up to explain what happened.In the southwest (Saravan), IRGC troops ambushed a group of Iranian Baluchi rebels entering Iran from Pakistan (where these rebels often establish bases). Four of the rebels were killed and two wounded (and captured). One of the dead was a known leader of rebel group Jaish al-Adl. Several other rebels escaped the ambush and fled back into Pakistan.Turkey told the U.S. that it would not observe the American economic sanctions against Iran. Turkey and Russia plan to continue trading with Iran using local currencies (lira, ruble and rial). That means all three of those currencies will become even less useful in foreign trade requiring dollars. Turkey is already having a financial crisis regarding the lira that is not related to the Iran sanctions. This pledge to trade with Iran anyway makes the Turkish financial situation worse.The U.S. repeated that it would be in Syria until Iranian forces were gone but that American presence would not always include troops on the ground. Currently, there are 2,000 American troops in Syria, most of them training and advising Kurdish forces. All these could be removed if the United States believed it could maintain its leverage in Syria using air power and diplomacy.Israel released photos of an Iranian missile assembly and upgrade facility in Lebanon (next to the Beirut airport). This facility will be used to upgrade (with a GPS guidance system) a lot of the long-range Iranian rockets Hezbollah already have. Israel also revealed photos of the Iranian capital where the hardware for the Iranian nuclear weapons program (including 15 kg of nuclear material) had been stored. Israel accused Western, especially European, nations of deliberately ignoring information like this even when it was obtained by their own intel agencies rather than via public Israeli revelations. (Imagine that, an Intelligence agency that makes public revelations. This is a prime example of why operating in secrecy is not all it’s cracked up to be. If corrupted it can work against its own countries best interest.)September 25, 2018: In Yemen a team of British experts confirmed that components used in landmines and roadside bombs in Yemen were Iranian. There was similar evidence found in Saudi Arabia when components of destroyed ballistic missiles were collected and examined. Iran denies everything.September 24, 2018: Russia announced that it would begin upgrading Syrian air defenses by delivering up to four S-300 SAM batteries. First deliveries will arrive by mid-October. In addition, Russia said it would try to jam electronics of aircraft making attacks in Syria. In other words, Russia is threatening to stop Israeli air operations in Syria. Unless Israel could get around this jamming electronically (possible, but difficult) the usual response is to destroy the jamming equipment. In most cases, the jammers will be operated by Russians and that would be a problem for Israel and disastrous for the Russians, who are trying to hide the fact that a lot of their military equipment is not as effective as the Russians claim it is. This is all about the recent loss of a Russian four engine Il-20 maritime patrol aircraft off the coast to Syrian S-200 SAMs. This sort of “friendly fire” is not supposed to happen, at least if your IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) equipment works. Something failed and it was apparently Russian, and Russia does not want to dwell on that with existing or potential customers. One of those potential customers, Saudi Arabia, is not happy about the Syrians getting S-300 systems, because the S-300 surveillance radars have sufficient range (over 300 kilometers) to monitor air traffic in much of Saudi Arabia. Israel has repeatedly made it clear that it will not stop attacking Iranian targets in Syria. This sort of threat is usually the Russian way of saying (to Israel); we have to talk about how Israel is going to help get Russia out of this mess.September 23, 2018: An Iranian diplomat, stationed in Algeria since 2015, was forced to leave the country after repeated complaints that he was a key operative in the recruitment of Algerian Shia Moslems to go fight as Iranian mercenaries in Syria. There are about 800,000 Shia in Algeria and the Iranian embassy encouraged Algerians to adopt the Shia form of Islam but did do quietly.September 22, 2018: In the west (Khuzestan province) four gunmen fired on a parade killing 25 (including at least eight IRGC men) and wounding even more. Local Arab separatists (al Ahwaz National Resistance, a coalition of several groups) took credit as did ISIL. Over the next three days at least 20 people were arrested, and Iran blamed Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States and threatened to take revenge by attacking American forces in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. responded by reminding Iran that it has only itself to blame and most Iranians would agree. Many Iranians, both in Khuzestan and the capital openly concluded that Arab separatists were responsible. Since 2003 the Iranian Arabs in Khuzestan have been increasingly vocal, and often violent, about the harsh rule of the Iranian Shia. Iran is acutely aware of how unruly its own Arab minority (a few percent of the population) can be. There are a growing number of terrorist incidents inside Iran traced to Iranian Arabs. Most Iranian oil is pumped from the ancestral lands of these Arabs, who are bitter about how they receive little from all that oil income. The three million Arabs in Khuzestan province (formerly Arabistan) are Shia and have been ruled by non-Arab Iranians for centuries. Arab unrest here has grown since 2003 when the Sunni dictatorship was overthrown in Iraq and the Shia majority won elections to take power. Iranian Arabs noted that the Iraqi Shia were now getting most of the Iraqi oil income, unlike just across the border in Khuzestan. Since 2003 hundreds of Iranian Arabs have been arrested for separatist activities. Many are still in prison and over 30 have been executed.September 18, 2018: Due to the worsening economy in Iran (made worse by the American revival of sanctions in March) over 15 percent of the three million Afghan refugees still in eastern Iran have returned to Afghanistan so far this year. Nearly all of these Afghans are Shia who feared to return as long as the Afghan Taliban (and ISIL) were active in Afghanistan. These two groups and Sunni Islamic terror groups, in general, consider Shia heretics and targets them for death on a regular basis. But Iran has made returning to Afghanistan easier by increasing its support for the Afghan Taliban. This gesture is also a favor to Pakistan, which Iran is trying to maintain good relations with (as Pakistan is also an ally of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is the only Moslem nation with nukes).September 17, 2018: Russian, Turkish and Iranian official worked out a way to deal with the remaining Islamic terrorists in northwest Syria (Idlib province) without triggering a large movement of refugees trying to get into Turkey. This deal calls for the establishment (by October 15th) of a demilitarized zone 15-25 kilometers wide that would separate government and rebel forces. Russia and Turkey would then deal with the Islamic terrorists in some undefined manner that apparently involves Turkey persuading most of the Islamic terrorist rebels that are Syrian to join an FSA, secular rebel group that Turkey backs. Those who refuse this offer would be attacked in such a way (a few small groups hit at a time) that a lot of civilians would not be compelled to flee. This compromise is vague on critical details but has delayed the offensive to take Idlib from the Islamic terrorists by force. Iran goes along with whatever Russia and Turkey want because Iran is more concerned with their efforts to destroy Israel.September 16, 2018: In Syria, two more IRGC men were killed in combat. Unofficial data (collected from the Internet or local Iranian reports of funerals) indicates about 2,400 Iranians have died in Syria since 2011.September 15, 2018: An Israeli airstrike in Syria (Damascus) not only destroyed a warehouse full of Iranian weapons. The airstrike also destroyed a B747 freighter aircraft belonging to Saha Airlines, an operation owned by the IRGC. This aircraft had recently landed at the airport and not yet been unloaded. The IRGC operates several freighter aircraft, most of them B747s using several Iranian airlines. Apparently, Israel is seeking to destroy the aircraft.September 8, 2018: In the northeast (Erbil province) Iran fired long-range rockets and some Fateh 110 ballistic missiles at targets in northern Iraq (the town of Koya, halfway between the Kurdish capital of Erbil and the Iranian border). The missiles were aimed at the headquarters of two Iranian Kurdish separatist groups (KDPI and PDKI). At least 17 were killed and dozens wounded by the rockets. Some of the rockets landed in or near a refugee camp outside the town. The Fateh 110 is a solid fuel missile that can be launched from trucks that carry them and have a range of 300 kilometers. The guidance system enables them to hit a specific building, which one of them did in the Koya attacks. The next day Iran admitted it made the missile attack.In a prison near the capital (Tehran), three more Kurdish Iranians were executed for opposing Iranian rule. That makes about 50 Kurds executed so far this year.In southern Iraq (Basra), a large crowd of Iraqi Shia attacked the Iranian consulate, set fires and burned an Iranian flag and a picture of Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The protests in Basra have been going on since July and so far, have left at least 25 dead. While the protests are mostly against government corruption that includes Iranian efforts to control events in Iraq.September 7, 2018: The presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey met in Iran to decide what their common strategy will be in Syria and Syrian troops assemble in the northwest to retake Idlib province from the last major force of rebels left in Syria. Turkey asked for a truce in Idlib so that Turkey could try and negotiate a peaceful surrender. Russia and Iran rejected that at first, but the final agreement was all about everyone coordinating their efforts in Syria and that means Turkey has an opportunity to negotiate and carry out as many deals with Idlib rebels as it can manage. Turkey intends to indefinitely maintain a buffer zone on the Syrian side of the border, and this would include Idlib province. This would give Turkey the opportunity to offer somewhere that former rebels can live that is in Syria but not subject to retribution by Syrian or Iranian troops or secret police.In the northwest (Kurdistan province) IRGC troops killed six PJAK men sought for taking part in a July clash that left 11 IRGC men dead.In eastern Syria, near the American base at Tanf, a company of U.S. marines conducted a live fire training exercise involving an aerial assault. This was done for the benefit of Iran, Syria and Russia, who have indicated they might deal with the Tanf base (which is near the Iran and Jordan borders). The United States has already attacked Iranian mercenaries and Syrian troops who got inside the 35 kilometer “security zone” the United States has established around the Tanf base. The only way a ground assault could work would be if the attackers had air support and only Russia has modern warplanes in Syria that have a chance of dealing with American fighters and air defenses in general. Yesterday Russia said its aircraft might enter the 35-kilometer (from the base) zone in pursuit of Islamic terrorists. The U.S. responded that American forces could take care of any intrusion and Russian aircraft should stay out. The American show of force caused the Russians to withdraw their offer of air support. Trump's Venezuela envoy clashes with Ilhan Omar at hearing: 'That is a ridiculous question' By Andrew O'Reilly | Fox NewsThe Trump administration's new special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, clashed Wednesday with freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., during a House hearing on the Caracas crisis after the congresswoman tried to turn focus to Abrams' history in Latin America while asking him point-blank whether he'd support ""genocide"" if it served American interests. Abrams fired back, calling the line of questioning ""ridiculous"" and refusing to respond to the personal ""attack.""The questioning was the latest moment in the spotlight for Omar, who earlier this week apologized for tweets considered anti-Semitic -- and who previously criticized what she described as a ""US backed coup"" in Venezuela, though many countries beyond the U.S. have recognized Juan Guaido, the opposition head of the National Assembly, as the interim president over Nicolás Maduro.On Wednesday, Omar began her questioning of Abrams with his connection to the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration, U.S. support of the right-wing government of José Napoleón Duarte during the Salvadoran Civil War and Washington’s broader involvement in Latin America’s civil conflicts during the 1970s and 1980s. “In 1991, you pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information to Congress regarding your involvement [in] the Iran-Contra affair for which you were later pardoned by George H.W. Bush,” Omar said. “I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.” The Iran-Contra affair involved senior Reagan administration officials secretly facilitating the sale of arms to Iran, which was the subject of an arms embargo, in the hopes of using those funds to support right-wing paramilitaries attempting to overthrow Nicaragua’s Sandinista government. Abrams attempted to respond, but Omar said she was not asking a question and went on to criticize him for his 1982 testimony before the Senate in which he dismissed as “communist propaganda” reports about the El Mozote Massacre, where the Salvadoran army killed more than 800 civilians in 1981. The soldiers responsible for the massacre, the Atlacatl Battalion, had recently been trained by U.S. forces.Omar then asked if he would “support crimes against humanity or genocide if you believe they were serving U.S. interests as you did in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.” Abrams in the past had defended Guatemalan dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, who oversaw a campaign in which thousands of Guatemalans were either massacred or disappeared and who was later convicted of genocide. Omar, though, has also faced criticism for challenging the U.S. policy in Venezuela, and her questions appeared to suggest active U.S. opposition to Maduro, who has overseen a complete economic collapse in Venezuela, could spiral into ""genocide.""Abrams responded: “I don’t believe this line of questioning is meant to be real questions and so I will not reply.” Omar then said she wanted to know whether ""a genocide will take place and you will look the other way because American interests were being upheld."" Abrams said the American policy in Venezuela is to support the Venezuelan people's effort to restore democracy.During less-contentious points during the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Abrams -- who was recently named by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to handle U.S. policy in Venezuela -- told members of the committee that while the administration prefers to use economic, humanitarian and diplomatic channels to deal with the regime of disputed Venezuelan President Maduro, the use of military force is not being ruled out. “When we say all options are on the table, that is because all options are on the table,” Abrams said, adding that military force “is not the preferred route and not the route we’re going down.” The comments on Capitol Hill by Abrams came as President Trump met in the Oval Office with Colombian President Ivan Duque. The two leaders discussed, among other issues, the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela that has sent an estimated 1.14 million refugees into neighboring Colombia.“I always have a plan B, and C, and D, and E and F,” Trump said. “A lot of things are happening in Venezuela that people don't know about, there's a lot of support for what we're doing, tremendous support.” (Our presidents Alt-right GOP handlers are making him look like a fool by programming him to answer questions in ways such as this.) Despite having the world's largest oil reserves, Venezuela is gripped by widespread malnutrition, disease and violence after 20 years of socialist rule launched by the late President Hugo Chavez. Critics accuse Maduro, Chavez's hand-picked successor, of unfairly winning an election last year for a second six-year term by banning his popular rivals from running and jailing others.The U.S. and other nations want Maduro to step down and have recognized National Assembly leader Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader. Venezuelans have also staged large protests to pressure Maduro to leave. Venezuela's opposition has called its supporters into the streets across the country in a campaign to break the military's support of Maduro, while Maduro is rallying supporters to demonstrations following more than a month of pressure led by Guaido. ""Right now, I'm going to give this order to the armed forces: Allow in the humanitarian aid. That's an order,"" Guaido told the mass of people gathered in Caracas. The struggle now centers on emergency food and medicine from the United States warehoused on the Colombian border town of Cucuta.Guaido said this week that he will try to run caravans of badly needed food and medicine into Venezuela but won't start for nearly two weeks. Maduro has blocked aid shipments for his crisis-torn country, calling the aid part of a U.S.-led coup to topple him. On Capitol Hill, Abrams did not predict when Maduro would step down, but noted that ""a storm is brewing"" inside his government and the Venezuelan leader ""will not be able to weather it much longer."" Abrams noted that U.S. oil sanctions are starting to bite the economically devastated country and are expected to cause oil production to be cut in half by the end of the year. He also urged the armed forces in Venezuela to abandon their support of Maduro and join Guaido’s camp. “There are off ramps if they support the people of Venezuela,” Abrams said of the Venezuelan military brass.Fox News Virginia Nicolaidis and The Associated Press contributed to this report. Ilhan Omar says she does not recognize Venezuelan interim president, defying Dem leadership, Western governments By Lukas Mikelionis | Fox News 3/1/2019Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar said she does not recognize Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim Venezuelan president, defying consensus among Western leaders and her own party. The Democrat refused to endorse Guaido and even came out against the opposition leader in an interview published on Thursday, where she went on to float the far-left conspiracy theory that the U.S. government is sending humanitarian aid to Venezuela “in the guise of eventually invading this country.” “Well the constitution of Venezuela says that there needs to be an election called within 30 days and we’re waiting for that to happen,” Omar said during an interview with the Intercept. “What we should be involved in is having diplomatic conversations and bringing people to the table and being a partner in facilitating that. But we are threatening, we are threatening intervention. We’re sending humanitarian aid that is in the guise of, you know, eventually invading this country and the people of the country don’t want us there,” she added. (This is no conspiracy theory when it is backed-up by a long history of proven facts.  Trump is striving to do something good, but Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo have foisted Elliott Abrams and John Bolton on him. What are people to think will be the end results with these people and the CIA involved? There are absolutely legitimate concerns that the CIA will want to turn Venezuela into a dictatorship as they’ve done so many times before. The problem is that this has been going on for years and a lot of people have already starved to death and a lot of people are starving to death, now. Let’s be clear, the people of Venezuela don’t want the CIA or the FBI in their country. China and Russia voted against a UN resolution to hold elections and to deliver humanitarian aid to the people. They’re too late, they’ve already lost face in this situation. The point is, the people needed the aid yesterday and they can’t wait any longer. Congress must approve a unilateral peace keeping mission that brings enough smack that China and Russia withdraw support for Maduro. We need to stick an aircraft carrier up Maduro’s Caribbean Sea and bring air support and armored troop carriers as escorts for the aid and make it perfectly clear that there will be no retaliation by Maduro or his military. Maduro and his generals must be ordered to present themselves to Juan Guido, to be taken into custody by the interim President of Venezuela to stand trial for their crimes. They were offered amnesty and they turned it down. End of story.It is time for Congress and the president to bring the drug king pin to the world and the dictatorship promoting agencies that have destroyed are reputation around the world down.)The host of the podcast then asked whether Omar shares the view of her fellow Democrats and Western governments that Guaido is the current leader of the country. “Absolutely not,” Omar replied.Omar has been facing criticism over her resistance to the U.S. support for Guaido and opposition to the socialist regime of Nicolás Maduro, whose government is on the verge of collapse due to public and international pressure. Earlier this year, she accused President Trump of backing a “coup” in Venezuela, despite the international community’s agreement that Maduro won a sham election. “A US-backed coup in Venezuela is not a solution to the dire issues they face,” Omar tweeted. “Trump’s efforts to install a far-right opposition will only incite violence and further destabilize the region. We Must support Mexico, Uruguay, & the Vatican’s efforts to facilitate a peaceful dialogue.”  Who is you? And what you gonna do? Who is who? And what you gonna do? We’re about to find out!

Here we lay out the conflicting accounts of what Trump’s former personal attorney told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform at the Feb. 27 hearing, and what the president has said in the past. Why don’t you lay out the conflicting accounts given Michael Cohen?WikileaksA key unresolved issue in the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election is whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. Russia intelligence services hacked into the computer network of Democratic Party officials and released the hacked material to WikiLeaks and others “to help President-elect Trump’s election chances,” according to a U.S. intelligence report released in January 2017.  (This is the first big lie that FactCheck.Org tells. They know that and the public knows that the emails weren’t hacked, they were stolen. This is a proven fact. All of the evidence that has been gathered, point to Seth Rich. Clearly, a man who was a super patriot. Wikileaks is loved by the public because the public understands the evil and wicked power of secrecy and the utterly ruthless way that they attack those who threaten them. Donald Trump is a direct threat to the Bilderbergers. Bill and Hilary are members. Hilary sold 20% of the mineral rights for the uranium buried in the United States to Vladimir Putin. How can anyone possibly buy the false narrative that Putin favored Trump over Hilary in the election? The Bilderbergers are the most powerful tentacle of China, and the most tightly controlled. The problem China has with those that it most tightly controls, is that it turns them into complete and utter psychopaths that totally lack any imagination. This is why they grasp to lies that no one buys. They can’t change gears, so they rely entirely on fear tactics and coercion. Some might argue that fear tactics and coercion are the same thing because fear tactics are coercion, but they are not the same thing because fear tactics are not the only form that coercion can take. Fear tactics are threats to break your arms and legs and to murder your wife and children and you can bet your life that Michael Cohen has faced this reality and agreed to comply. When they have gotten you to be compliant then they use a different kind of coercion. They begin prepping you to take the stage and become a very convincing actor. This kind of coercion is called programming.) In his opening statement, Cohen said he was in Trump’s office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, Trump’s informal adviser and longtime friend, was on speaker phone talking about WikiLeaks and its plan to publicly release emails damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Cohen, Feb. 27: In July of 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of “wouldn’t that be great.”Cohen’s statement directly contradicts Trump’s claim that he never spoke to Stone about WikiLeaks.In an interview last month with the New York Times, shortly after Stone was indicted by the special counsel’s office for lying to Congress, Trump had this exchange:Maggie Haberman, Times reporter, Jan. 31: Did you ever talk to him about WikiLeaks? Because that seemed —Trump: No. (Truth or lie, the American people know that if Trump lets this line of enquiry open, he will never hear the end of it. Trump has more experience than most people in dealing with the powers and principalities that rule the world. Yes, it will certainly be proven that he was willing to pull some strings to hold onto his money. He didn’t need to do this as badly as the average folk, but he hasn’t ever been as intimidated by the power of the IRS as we average folk are, either. He was raised in New York City by a housing contractor that had fought his way to the top. This gave Mr. Trump a huge leg up in the contracting business and he took it to a whole other level by building high-rise mansions. None of this takes away from the fact that Mr. Trump has pledged to restore democracy in the western hemisphere starting with Venezuela. I believe I can see the big picture, and it worries me that they will kill Mr. Trump, the same way they assassinated John F. Kennedy at the very first opportunity. Mr. Trump is not just stomping on the toes of the Bilderbergers; he is stepping on the toes of the puppeteers behind the curtain pulling the Bilderbergers strings. China is directly and openly  involved in Venezuela. We must back Mr. Trump up in whatever way we can. The most important thing for Mr. Trump to do is to take personal control over restoring democracy in the western hemisphere, first in Venezuela and then in Honduras and Guatemala. Somehow, we must convey the explicit message to Mr. Trump, not to expose himself to danger by campaigning or travelling abroad by assuring him that if he can just achieve the  goals pertaining to Venezuela that he will be re-elected by a landslide. Venezuela is a difficult and dangerous problem by itself. Mr. Trump must begin by first, delivering humanitarian aid to the people, second removing Maduro and conducting free and fair elections,  third by restocking the shelves of all the grocery stores and pharmacies large ones and small ones for free, so they can be open for business. I expect that this will be all they need to get most other businesses back to normal. As for the oil business, my advice is, don’t throw good money after bad. The oil business is in decline, as it should be. And it is the bread and butter of the Bilderbergers, as I am certain Mr. Trump is well aware. Sure, CITGO is going to be able to bring some wealth to Venezuela, but it would be a waste of good money for anyone in the oil business to be expanding. China has already committed to producing only electric cars. So has General Motors. China is a grave threat to the world, economically and very soon, militarily. But China is pumping out pollution at such a high rate that it can be detected on the west coast of the US. If we handle this correctly, it can be a strong point of leverage economically.)Haberman: You never had conversations with him.Trump: No, I didn’t. I never did.We should note that there is no evidence that Stone ever talked to Assange, although that doesn’t mean that Stone didn’t boast that he did. Stone, however, texted  news organizations after Cohen’s opening remarks to say: “Mr. Cohen’s statement is not true.”However, the special counsel’s office alleges that on “multiple occasions” Stone “told senior Trump Campaign officials about materials possessed by Organization 1 and the timing of future releases,” as laid out in the indictment against Stone. The indictment refers to WikiLeaks as “Organization 1.” (See “Timeline of Russia Investigation” for more details on Russia’s influence campaign and WikiLeaks’ role in it.)             (I have faith in the people of this country’s ability to see through all of this, and consign it to the dung heap, where it belongs by insisting that Congress get behind Mr. Trump with as much bipartisan support as they can muster and move on! We must find a way to work together and stop spinning our wheels and wasting billions of dollars.)Moscow TowerThe Trump Organization was actively pursuing a real estate project in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign, but the public didn’t learn about it until the Washington Post  broke the story in August 2017 — about seven months into the Trump presidency.Trump signed a letter of intent with a Moscow-based developer, I.C. Expert Investment Co., on Oct. 28, 2015. Cohen and Felix Sater, a Trump business associate, led the Trump Organization’s negotiations with Russian officials until at least June 2016 — which was the same month when reports first surfaced that Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee’s servers. At the time, the Trump campaign dismissed the hack as an inside job, not the work of Russia, and Trump issued numerous statements over the next several months saying he had no business dealings in Russia.In a July 27, 2016, interview with a CBS affiliate in Miami, Trump said, “I have nothing to do with Russia. I don’t have any jobs in Russia. I’m all over the world but we’re not involved in Russia.” A day earlier, he tweeted he has “ZERO investments in Russia.” Even after he became president — but before the public learned about the Trump Moscow project — Trump denied having any business dealings in Russia. “I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago. I had the Miss Universe pageant — which I owned for quite a while — I had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia,” Trump said in a May 2017 interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. In the NBC interview, and throughout the campaign, the president omitted any mention of his company’s pursuit of the Moscow project. That was done on purpose, Cohen testified. Cohen told the House oversight committee that Trump “knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.”Cohen, Feb. 27: In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no Russian business and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.Cohen continued to lie even after the Post broke the story about the Moscow project and it became public knowledge. (Perhaps Cohen was lying to Mr. Trump in collusion with the FBI. Perhaps the FBI were already working on their insurance policy to frame Trump for colluding with the Russians in 2015.)In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress when he told two congressional committees that the company’s pursuit of the project ended in January 2016 before “the Iowa caucus and … the very first primary.” In fact, he said in his guilty plea, the Trump Organization continued negotiations into June 2016 — a month before Trump was nominated at the Republican National Convention.  After Cohen’s guilty plea in November, Trump falsely claimed that the Moscow project was “a very public deal” that “everybody knew about” and “was written about in newspapers.” Last month, Trump dismissed the Moscow project as a “very unimportant deal,” as he told the New York Times. “I had no money invested. It was a letter of intent, or option,” Trump told the Times. “It was a free option. It was a nothing. And I wasn’t doing anything. I don’t consider that even business. And frankly, that wasn’t even on my radar.” Cohen testified that the Moscow project was on Trump’s radar, “because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.” “There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January of 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me ‘How’s it going in Russia?’ – referring to the Moscow Tower project,” Cohen said at the Feb. 27 House hearing. Stormy Daniels' Hush MoneyAs we have written before, the president has denied that he had an affair with porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. He also denied, at least initially, knowing anything about the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Daniels in late October 2016 to prevent her from speaking out about the affair and damaging the campaign. The Wall Street Journal broke the story about the hush money payment on Jan. 12, 2018. The White House and Cohen denied the affair, without addressing the hush money payments. “These are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,” the White House said in a statement to the Journal. Daniels —  in a statement issued by Cohen on behalf of Daniels — said “rumors” about “hush money” payments are “completely false.”In early April, a reporter asked Trump directly if he knew anything about the payment. He answered, “No. No. What else?” Pressed if he knew where Cohen got the money, Trump said, “I don’t know.” But that false narrative was exposed on Aug. 21, when Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for arranging —  “in coordination and at the direction of” Trump — payments of $130,000 to Daniels and $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal. In McDougal’s case, Cohen admitted to “causing” American Media Inc., owner of the National Enquirer, to pay McDougal for exclusive rights to her story of an extramarital affair with Trump with the express purpose of killing McDougal’s story and preventing it from influencing the election, according to the plea agreement. In his testimony before the House oversight committee, Cohen provided a copy of a $35,000 check that he received from Trump in August 2017 — one of 11 payments Cohen said he received as reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump signed that check 10 months before he denied knowing anything about the payment when asked about it in April 2018.Cohen, Feb. 27: As Exhibit 5A to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 – when he was president of the United States – pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me — the word used by Mr. Trump’s TV lawyer — for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf.For his part, Trump has since acknowledged the payment to Daniels. Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, made that disclosure on May 2, 2018, and Trump confirmed it on Twitter the next day. But Trump has maintained that he “never directed Michael Cohen to break the law,” and he has rejected the government’s contention that it was a campaign finance violation. Trump called it a “simple private transaction,” not an illegal campaign contribution. (Exactly, the public knows how the “Swamp” can turn the truth into a lie backed by facts. Unfortunately, that is a defining factor in politics today. It’s called being politically correct. I was wrong when I said; “It’s not a lie it’s just politically correct.” It is a lie, but it uses the truth and twists it into a false narrative that serves a political purpose. There is a lot of work to be done by counties when we obtain sovereignty over the people of the county, re-examining each state and federal law to understand how politicians redefined things to serve some very nefarious purposes, and correct them. The one that comes to mind is the legal definition of the “Gay” community as a minority group. I made the mistake myself, in the eighties of arguing that they were a very small percentage of the population, therefore they were a minority, and besides what difference does it make. I suspect that many people felt that way at the time. But now I know, as I’m sure everyone else knows by now; By legally defining “Gays” as a minority group it legally transformed them into something, they claim to be but are not. That is that they are born that way and that it is normal. This allows them to claim to be just like a race of people, they are not a race and they are not normal they are victims of intense programming. “Third-Eye Tech” can provide individuals with the level of awareness of when their husband or wife is putting in a trance state and allow them the self-awareness to free themselves without turning to the very ones that are most responsible for promoting this cycle of abuse as Kathy O’Brien has made the mistake of doing. There are many such state and federal laws that will require careful examination of the wording and the legal definition of the choice of words. It is a disturbing factor that legal definitions are sometimes quite the opposite of how the general public defines them.)Trump's Net WorthDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump boasted that he was worth $10 billion. “The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I’m very proud of the job I did,” he said during an August 2015 debate.But, as we wrote at the time, outside estimates attested to Trump’s wealth, but placed the amount at between $3 billion and $4 billion.In his testimony, Cohen said Trump “directed us to inflate his net worth and inflate his assets,” providing the committee with portions of statements of financial condition for 2011 and 2013.“It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,” he said.Vietnam WarTrump got five deferments during the Vietnam War, including one for bone spurs in his heels. But in his opening statement, Cohen challenged the diagnosis of bone spurs — suggesting it was a ruse to avoid going to war.Cohen, Feb. 27: Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said that there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. “You think I’m stupid, I’m not going to Vietnam.”We have no idea what Trump told Cohen and, even by Cohen’s account, Trump did not directly say that the bone spur diagnosis was a fake. Cohen’s comment does, however, corroborate the account of two daughters of the podiatrist who diagnosed Trump with bone spurs. In December, they told the New York Times that their late father made the diagnosis as a courtesy to Trump’s father, Fred.“I know it was a favor,” one daughter, Dr. Elysa Braunstein, told the paper. She and “her sister, Sharon Kessel, 53, shared the family’s account for the first time publicly when contacted by The New York Times,” the paper wrote. Russian CollusionIn his response to Cohen’s testimony, the president criticized his former lawyer for lying “about so many different things.” But, he said, he was “actually impressed” that Cohen “said he saw no collusion” between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its agents during the 2016 campaign. “I mean, he lied about so many different things, and I was actually impressed that he didn’t say, ‘Well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that.’ He didn’t say that. He said, ‘No collusion,'” the president said at a press conference in Vietnam, where he was meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “And I was, you know, a little impressed by that, frankly.”Cohen didn’t exactly say there was “no collusion,” but he did say that he didn’t have any evidence of it. (Right! DUH!)In his opening remarks, Cohen said, “Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions.” Later, asked by Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz if he was aware of any instances of Trump lying about colluding with the Russians, Cohen said he couldn’t answer the question — but again expressed his suspicions. “I’m not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion,” he said. “I was not part of the campaign. I don’t know the other conversations that Mr. Trump had with other individuals. There’s just so many dots that all seem to lead to the same direction.”The Trump campaign issued a statement in response to Cohen’s testimony that relied heavily on the words of federal prosecutors who described Cohen as a liar. “As noted by the Southern District of New York, Cohen’s wide array of crimes were ‘marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life’ and his ‘instinct to blame others is strong,'” the statement said. That is true. Those partial quotes come from a sentencing memo filed in December. But it is also true that the sentencing statement said Cohen provided “credible” information to the Southern District of New York. “With respect to Cohen’s provision of information to this Office, in its two meetings with him, this Office assessed Cohen to be forthright and credible, and the information he provided was largely consistent with other evidence gathered,” the memo stated.We can’t say whether Cohen’s version of events is correct in cases where it’s his word against Trump’s. In some instances, he provides evidence, or his allegations are corroborated by other people or other evidence. But in other cases, Cohen provides no evidence at all. All we can do is lay out the facts and let others draw their own conclusions.

Then He Did It Again. 2/14/2019 Jon Schwarz The Intercept Elliott Abrams, President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Venezuela, appeared before the House Committee on Foreign Relations on Wednesday. About two hours into the hearing, committee member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., noted that Abrams pleaded guilty in 1991 to withholding information about the Iran-Contra affair from Congress. “I fail to understand,” Omar said, “why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.” Omar’s skepticism was well-founded: Just moments later, Abrams told her several egregious lies. Abrams’s most notable lies occurred during this exchange about his actions as assistant secretary of state in the 1980s during the Reagan administration:OMAR: On February 8, 1982, you testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about U.S. policy in El Salvador. In that hearing, you dismissed as communist propaganda reports about the massacre at El Mozote in which more than 800 civilians, including children as young as 2 years old, were brutally murdered by U.S.-trained troops. During that massacre, some of those troops bragged about raping a 12-year-old girl, girls, before they killed them. You later said that the U.S. policy in El Salvador was a “fabulous achievement.” Yes or no, do you still think so?ABRAMS: From the day that President Duarte was elected in a free election, to this day, El Salvador has been a democracy. That’s a fabulous achievement.Abrams’s words were “not only factually, demonstrably untrue, but grossly so,” according to Alejandro Velasco, a professor of modern Latin American history at New York University. His testimony, said Velasco, “continues a pattern he has shown since the 1980s of hubristically rejecting out of hand any suggestion that defeating social justice struggles in the 1980s, through the most brutal means, should in any way be seen as anything other than a resounding victory for the U.S.”To start: When José Napoleón Duarte was elected president of El Salvador in 1984, it was not “a free election.” Duarte was one of many Salvadoran politicians who spent time on the CIA’s payroll. In March 1980, he joined a junta that had recently seized power, and by the end of the year had become the junta’s head. He stayed there for the next year and a half — a period of stunning, gaudy brutality by the Salvadoran military against the country’s population. Tens of thousands were slaughtered with U.S support, including those killed during the El Mozote massacre described by Omar.Pratap Chitnis, a member of the U.K. House of Lords, traveled to El Salvador to witness the 1984 election on behalf of the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group. “Crucial to the whole standing of the exercise,” he reported, “was the fact that no politicians to the left of [Duarte’s] Christian Democrats” could participate. Why? Because, said official British observers, “had these representatives campaigned openly, they would have run a very high risk of being assassinated” by right-wing death squads. This was something like a U.S. presidential election in which the furthest-left candidate was Ted Cruz. Duarte’s only real competition was Roberto D’Aubuisson, founder of the ultraright wing ARENA party, who several years before had ordered the assassination of Óscar Romero, the beloved archbishop of San Salvador. Many Salvadorans he encountered, Chitnis wrote, “laughed at the significance of the elections” given “the atmosphere of terror and despair, of macabre rumour and grisly reality.” However, the Reagan administration realized that D’Aubuisson would be a PR disaster. So, after enabling the elimination of El Salvador’s left, they intervened with massive covert support for Duarte, the “moderate.”Thomas Carothers, a colleague of Abrams at the State Department, later wrote a book titled “In the Name of Democracy: U.S. Policy Toward Latin America in the Reagan Years.” Carothers was sympathetic to Abrams’s perspective and in fact, interviewed him for the book. Carothers states that “the administration approached the elections with two goals: ensuring that technically credible elections were held and that the Christian Democratic candidate, José Napoleón Duarte, won.” To that end, Carothers said, the CIA provided “a significant amount of funds, possibly between $1 million and $3 million, for Duarte’s campaign.” In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development overtly provided significant funds to help him. Jesse Helms, then North Carolina’s far-right senator and a supporter of D’Aubuisson, complained bitterly that the CIA bought the election for Duarte, whom he described as “a socialist.”“An election was held within a very limited range of the political spectrum; choices were given but very few,” Chitnis wrote. “I asked relatives of the disappeared and brutally murdered, ‘Do you think things will be better now that President Duarte has been elected?’ ‘It was under President Duarte that these things happened in the first place’, they replied.”Thus, Abrams obviously knows that this was no “free election.” As in the past, he was consciously attempting to deceive Congress.Needless to say, it also is not the case that “El Salvador has been a democracy” since 1984. Control of the country remained in the hands of the military, with Duarte a largely powerless figurehead. The cruel war of the government against Salvadorans ground on for years. In 1986, the archbishop of El Salvador condemned indiscriminate bombing of civilians by the air force, and the establishment of free fire zones in which any inhabitants were deemed to be guerrillas and hence worthy targets.When Duarte’s term was ending in 1989, the FMLN guerrilla group proposed a peace plan under which they would participate in the elections for a new president. Duarte rejected it, setting up a second election in which his party would be the left-most boundary of the possible. This time, however, ARENA “won.” According to the center-right Economist magazine, the “army frightened the voters, [ARENA] fixed the results, and its electoral commission delayed announcing them” until the vote tallies could be adjusted.ARENA celebrated its democratic triumph with the notorious murder of six Jesuit priests and their housekeeper at Central American University in San Salvador. When Congress sent a delegation to investigate what was going on in El Salvador, they found that 14 of the top 15 highest-ranking Salvadoran military officers had ties to death squads.By the time the next two elections came in 1994 and 1999, Abrams was out of office. Perhaps coincidentally, both were largely legitimate, at least formally. By 2004, Abrams was back in government in the George W. Bush administration, and the U.S. again attempted to intervene to pick the election’s winner. In 2009, with Abrams out of power once again, the FMLN won a presidential election for the first time. The Economist now characterizes the Salvadoran political system as a “hybrid regime,” meaning that “elections have substantial irregularities that often prevent them from being both free and fair.” They have not permitted any genuine change that would allow the deep wounds of Salvadoran society to heal.El Salvador now has by far the highest murder rate in the world — 15 times that of the U.S. and about 50 percent higher than Venezuela, itself notoriously violent. It is beset by “pervasive criminal gangs.” At $8,900, its per capita GDP ranks 146th in the world. According to the CIA Factbook, at least 20 percent of its population lives abroad, compared to 10 percent of Venezuelans — a situation which is rightfully seen as a crisis.So, Abrams is just as willing now as he was 30 years ago to mislead Congress. But what’s most ominous is that — given that he sees El Salvador as a “fabulous achievement” — he presumably would see a similar outcome for Venezuela as a fabulous achievement as well. “No one who even marginally believes in democracy, human rights, and the self-determination of peoples can count Abrams as an ally, as his actual record amply demonstrates,” said Velasco. “Anyone who does so is either willfully ignorant or worse, complicit in the very crimes they say they are trying to combat in Venezuela.” Elliott Abrams, Trump’s Pick to Bring “Democracy” to Venezuela, Has Spent His Life Crushing Democracy: Jon Schwarz The Intercept 1/30/2019 On December 11, 1981 in El Salvador, a Salvadoran military unit created and trained by the U.S. Army began slaughtering everyone they could find in a remote village called El Mozote. Before murdering the women and girls, the soldiers raped them repeatedly, including some as young as 10 years old, and joked that their favorites were the 12-year-olds. One witness described a soldier tossing a 3-year-old child into the air and impaling him with his bayonet. The final death toll was over 800 people. The next day, December 12, was the first day on the job for Elliott Abrams as assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs in the Reagan administration. Abrams snapped into action, helping to lead a cover-up of the massacre. News reports of what had happened, Abrams told the Senate, were “not credible,” and the whole thing was being “significantly misused” as propaganda by anti-government guerillas.This past Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo named Abrams as America’s special envoy for Venezuela. According to Pompeo, Abrams “will have responsibility for all things related to our efforts to restore democracy” in the oil-rich nation. The choice of Abrams sends a clear message to Venezuela and the world: The Trump administration intends to brutalize Venezuela, while producing a stream of unctuous rhetoric about America’s love for democracy and human rights. Combining these two factors — the brutality and the unctuousness — is Abrams’s core competency.Abrams previously served in a multitude of positions in the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, often with titles declaring their focus on morality. First, he was assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs (in 1981); then the State Department “human rights” position mentioned above (1981-85); assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs (1985-89); senior director for democracy, human rights, and international operations for the National Security Council (2001-05); and finally, Bush’s deputy national security adviser for global democracy strategy (2005-09).In these positions, Abrams participated in many of the most ghastly acts of U.S. foreign policy from the past 40 years, all the while proclaiming how deeply he cared about the foreigners he and his friends were murdering. Looking back, it’s uncanny to see how Abrams has almost always been there when U.S. actions were at their most sordid.Abrams, a graduate of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, joined the Reagan administration in 1981, at age 33. He soon received a promotion due to a stroke of luck: Reagan wanted to name Ernest Lefever as assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs, but Lefever’s nomination ran aground when two of his own brothers revealed that he believed African-Americans were “inferior, intellectually speaking.” A disappointed Reagan was forced to turn to Abrams as a second choice. A key Reagan administration concern at the time was Central America — in particular, the four adjoining nations of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. All had been dominated by tiny, cruel, white elites since their founding, with a century’s worth of help from U.S. interventions. In each country, the ruling families saw their society’s other inhabitants as human-shaped animals, who could be harnessed or killed as needed.But shortly before Reagan took office, Anastasio Somoza, the dictator of Nicaragua and a U.S. ally, had been overthrown by a socialist revolution. The Reaganites rationally saw this as a threat to the governments of Nicaragua’s neighbors. Each country had large populations who similarly did not enjoy being worked to death on coffee plantations or watching their children die of easily treated diseases. Some would take up arms, and some would simply try to keep their heads down, but all, from the perspective of the cold warriors in the White House, were likely “communists” taking orders from Moscow. They needed to be taught a lesson.El SalvadorThe extermination of El Mozote was just a drop in the river of what happened in El Salvador during the 1980s. About 75,000 Salvadorans died during what’s called a “civil war,” although almost all the killing was done by the government and its associated death squads. The numbers alone don’t tell the whole story. El Salvador is a small country, about the size of New Jersey. The equivalent number of deaths in the U.S. would be almost 5 million. Moreover, the Salvadoran regime continually engaged in acts of barbarism so heinous that there is no contemporary equivalent, except perhaps ISIS. In one instance, a Catholic priest reported that a peasant woman briefly left her three small children in the care of her mother and sister. When she returned, she found that all five had been decapitated by the Salvadoran National Guard. Their bodies were sitting around a table, with their hands placed on their heads in front of them, “as though each body was stroking its own head.” The hand of one, a toddler, apparently kept slipping off her small head, so it had been nailed onto it. At the center of the table was a large bowl full of blood.Criticism of U.S. policy at the time was not confined to the left. During this period, Charles Maechling Jr., who had led State Department planning for counterinsurgencies during the 1960s, wrote in the Los Angeles Times that the U.S. was supporting “Mafia-like oligarchies” in El Salvador and elsewhere and was directly complicit in “the methods of Heinrich Himmler’s extermination squads.”Abrams was one of the architects of the Reagan administration’s policy of full-throated support for the Salvadoran government. He had no qualms about any of it and no mercy for anyone who escaped the Salvadoran abattoir. In 1984, sounding exactly like Trump officials today, he explained that Salvadorans who were in the U.S. illegally should not receive any kind of special status. “Some groups argue that illegal aliens who are sent back to El Salvador meet persecution and often death,” he told the House of Representatives. “Obviously, we do not believe these claims, or we would not deport these people.”Even when out of office, 10 years after the El Mozote massacre, Abrams expressed doubt that anything untoward had occurred there. In 1993, when a United Nations truth commission found that 95 percent of the acts of violence that had taken place in El Salvador since 1980 had been committed by Abrams’s friends in the Salvadoran government, he called what he and his colleagues in the Reagan administration had done a “fabulous achievement.”GuatemalaThe situation in Guatemala during the 1980s was much the same, as were Abrams’s actions. After the U.S. engineered the overthrow of Guatemala’s democratically elected president in 1954, the country had descended into a nightmare of revolving military dictatorships. Between 1960 and 1996, in another “civil war,” 200,000 Guatemalans were killed — the equivalent of maybe 8 million people in America. A U.N. commission later found that the Guatemalan state was responsible for 93 percent of the human rights violations.Efraín Ríos Montt, who served as Guatemala’s president in the early 1980s, was found guilty in 2013, by Guatemala’s own justice system, of committing genocide against the country’s indigenous Mayans. During Ríos Montt’s administration, Abrams called for the lifting of an embargo on U.S. arms shipments to Guatemala, claiming that Ríos Montt had “brought considerable progress.” The U.S. had to support the Guatemalan government, Abrams argued, because “if we take the attitude ‘don’t come to us until you’re perfect, we’re going to walk away from this problem until Guatemala has a perfect human rights record,’ then we’re going to be leaving in the lurch people there who are trying to make progress.” One example of the people making an honest effort, according to Abrams, was Ríos Montt. Thanks to Ríos Montt, “there has been a tremendous change, especially in the attitude of the government toward the Indian population.” (Ríos Montt’s conviction was later set aside by Guatemala’s highest civilian court, and he died before a new trial could finish.)NicaraguaAbrams would become best known for his enthusiastic involvement with the Reagan administration’s push to overthrow Nicaragua’s revolutionary Sandinista government. He advocated for a full invasion of Nicaragua in 1983, immediately after the successful U.S. attack on the teeny island nation of Grenada. When Congress cut off funds to the Contras, an anti-Sandinista guerrilla force created by the U.S., Abrams successfully persuaded the Sultan of Brunei to cough up $10 million for the cause. Unfortunately, Abrams, acting under the code name “Kenilworth,” provided the Sultan with the wrong Swiss bank account number, so the money was wired instead to a random lucky recipient.Abrams was questioned by Congress about his Contra-related activities and lied voluminously. He later pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information. One was about the Sultan and his money, and another was about Abrams’s knowledge of a Contra resupply C-123 plane that had been shot down in 1986. In a nice historical rhyme with his new job in the Trump administration, Abrams had previously attempted to obtain two C-123s for the Contras from the military of Venezuela.Abrams received a sentence of 100 hours of community service and perceived the whole affair as an injustice of cosmic proportions. He soon wrote a book in which he described his inner monologue about his prosecutors, which went: “You miserable, filthy bastards, you bloodsuckers!” He was later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush on the latter’s way out the door after he lost the 1992 election.PanamaWhile it’s been forgotten now, before America invaded Panama to oust Manuel Noriega in 1989, he was a close ally of the U.S. — despite the fact the Reagan administration knew he was a large-scale drug trafficker. In 1985, Hugo Spadafora, a popular figure in Panama and its one-time vice minister for health, believed he had obtained proof of Noriega’s involvement in cocaine smuggling. He was on a bus on his way to Panama City to release it publicly when he was seized by Noriega’s thugs. According to the book “Overthrow” by former New York Times correspondent Stephen Kinzer, U.S. intelligence picked up Noriega giving his underlings the go-ahead to put Spadafora down like “a rabid dog.” They tortured Spadafora for a long night and then sawed off his head while he was still alive. When Spadafora’s body was found, his stomach was full of blood he’d swallowed.This was so horrific that it got people’s attention. But Abrams leapt to Noriega’s defense, blocking the U.S. ambassador to Panama from increasing pressure on the Panamanian leader. When Spadafora’s brother persuaded North Carolina’s hyper-conservative GOP Sen. Jesse Helms to hold hearings on Panama, Abrams told Helms that Noriega was “being really helpful to us” and was “really not that big a problem. … The Panamanians have promised they are going to help us with the Contras. If you have the hearings, it’ll alienate them.”… And That’s Not AllAbrams also engaged in malfeasance for no discernible reason, perhaps just to stay in shape. In 1986 a Colombian journalist named Patricia Lara was invited to the U.S. to attend a dinner, honoring writers who’d advanced “inter-American understanding and freedom of information.” When Lara arrived at New York’s Kennedy airport, she was taken into custody, then put on a plane back home. Soon afterward, Abrams went on “60 Minutes” to claim that Lara was a member of the “ruling committees” of M-19, a Colombian guerrilla movement. She also, according to Abrams, was ”an active liaison” between M-19 ”and the Cuban secret police.” Given the frequent right-wing paramilitary violence against Colombian reporters, this painted a target on Lara’s back. There was no evidence then that Abrams’s assertions were true — Colombia’s own conservative government denied it — and none has appeared since.Abrams’s never-ending, shameless deceptions wore down American reporters. “They said that black was white,” Joanne Omang at the Washington Post later explained about Abrams and his White House colleague Robert McFarlane. “Although I had used all my professional resources, I had misled my readers.” Omang was so exhausted by the experience that she quit her job trying to describe the real world to try to write fiction.Post-conviction Abrams was seen as damaged goods who couldn’t return to government. This underestimated him. Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the one-time chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tangled fiercely with Abrams in 1989 over the proper U.S. policy toward Noriega once it became clear he was more trouble than he was worth. Crowe strongly opposed a bright idea that Abrams had come up with: that the U.S. should establish a government-in-exile on Panamanian soil, which would require thousands of U.S. troops to guard. This was deeply boneheaded, Crowe said, but it didn’t matter. Crowe presciently issued a warning about Abrams: “This snake’s hard to kill.”To the surprise of Washington’s more naive insiders, Abrams was back in business soon after George W. Bush entered the White House. It might have been difficult to get Senate approval for someone who had deceived Congress, so Bush put him in a slot at the National Security Council — where no legislative branch approval was needed. Just like 20 years before, Abrams was handed a portfolio involving “democracy” and “human rights.”VenezuelaBy the beginning of 2002, Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chavez, had become deeply irritating to the Bush White House, which was filled with veterans of the battles of the 1980s. That April, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Chavez was pushed out of power in a coup. Whether and how the U.S. was involved is not yet known, and probably won’t be for decades until the relevant documents are declassified. But based on the previous 100 years, it would be surprising indeed if America didn’t play any behind-the-scenes role. For what it’s worth, the London Observer reported at the time that “the crucial figure around the coup was Abrams” and he “gave a nod” to the plotters. In any case, Chavez had enough popular support that he was able to regroup and return to office within days.IranAbrams apparently did play a key role in squelching a peace proposal from Iran in 2003, just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The plan arrived by fax, and should have gone to Abrams, and then to Condoleezza Rice, at the time Bush’s national security adviser. Instead it somehow never made it to Rice’s desk. When later asked about this, Abrams’s spokesperson replied that he “had no memory of any such fax.” (Abrams, like so many people who thrive at the highest level of politics, has a terrible memory for anything political. In 1984, he told Ted Koppel that he couldn’t recall for sure whether the U.S. had investigated reports of massacres in El Salvador. In 1986, when asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee if he’d discussed fundraising for the contras with anyone on the NSC’s staff, he likewise couldn’t remember.)Israel and PalestineAbrams was also at the center of another attempt to thwart the outcome of a democratic election, in 2006. Bush had pushed for legislative elections in the West Bank and Gaza in order to give Fatah, the highly corrupt Palestinian organization headed by Yasser Arafat’s successor, Mahmoud Abbas, some badly needed legitimacy. To everyone’s surprise, Fatah’s rival Hamas won, giving it the right to form a government. This unpleasant outburst of democracy was not acceptable to the Bush administration, in particular Rice and Abrams. They hatched a plan to form a Fatah militia to take over the Gaza Strip, and crush Hamas in its home territory. As reported by Vanity Fair, this involved a great deal of torture and executions. But Hamas stole a march on Fatah with their own ultra-violence. David Wurmser, a neoconservative who worked for Dick Cheney at the time, told Vanity Fair, “It looks to me that what happened wasn’t so much a coup by Hamas but an attempted coup by Fatah that was pre-empted before it could happen.” Yet ever since, these events have been turned upside down in the U.S. media, with Hamas being presented as the aggressors. While the U.S. plan was not a total success, it also was not a total failure from the perspective of America and Israel. The Palestinian civil war split the West Bank and Gaza into two entities, with rival governments in both. For the past 13 years, there’s been little sign of the political unity necessary for Palestinians to get a decent life for themselves.Abrams then left office with Bush’s exit. But now he’s back for a third rotation through the corridors of power – with the same kinds of schemes he’s executed the first two times. Looking back at Abrams’s lifetime of lies and savagery, it’s hard to imagine what he could say to justify it. But he does have a defense for everything he’s done — and it’s a good one. In 1995, Abrams appeared on “The Charlie Rose Show” with Allan Nairn, one of the most knowledgeable American reporters about U.S. foreign policy. Nairn noted that George H.W. Bush had once discussed putting Saddam Hussein on trial for crimes against humanity. This was a good idea, said Nairn, but “if you’re serious, you have to be even-handed” — which would mean also prosecuting officials like Abrams.Abrams chuckled at the ludicrousness of such a concept. That would require, he said, “putting all the American officials who won the Cold War in the dock.” Abrams was largely right. The distressing reality is that Abrams is no rogue outlier, but a respected, honored member of the center right of the U.S. foreign policy establishment. His first jobs before joining the Reagan administration were working for two Democratic senators, Henry Jackson and Daniel Moynihan. He was a senior fellow at the centrist Council on Foreign Relations. He’s been a member of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, and now is on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy. He’s taught the next generation of foreign policy officials at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. He didn’t somehow fool Reagan and George W. Bush — they wanted exactly what Abrams provided.So, no matter the gruesome particulars of Abrams’s career, the important thing to remember — as the U.S. eagle tightens its razor-sharp talons around yet another Latin American country — is that Abrams isn’t that exceptional. He’s mostly a cog in a machine. It’s the machine that’s the problem, not its malevolent parts. The machine is the CIA.Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar! Praise GOD! The power and the strength of the sacred feminine is not dead in the world. You’re the lucky one Mr. President, lucky that this brave and determined woman saved your bacon from the flaming furnace of continuing down the road with Elliott Abrams and the career criminal that brought him to you. Wash your hands of them and kick them to the curb. What say you, people of the USA? What should be done with Mike Pompeo and Elliott Abrams? Lock them up, lock them up, lock them up! Old George was only able to pardon Abrams of the crime of lying to Congress. He can still be tried for genocide. Mike Pompeo should be locked up with him for appointing him to a position where he could resume committing the same war crimes he presided over in the past. Mr. President you should thank Ilhan Omar for exposing these two criminals and the best way you can do that is to end the fighting in Somalia. You need to find two people to replace Pompeo and Abrams that will do the jobs that must be done. Delivering humanitarian aid to Venezuela in a way that avoids getting anyone killed and restoring democracy resulting in the shedding of the weak false auspices of parliament culminating in free and fair elections in which the president is elected by the people. The best way to assure that Venezuela is handled correctly is take personal charge of it yourself and to marginalize Pence by sending him to Iraq with well-publicized specific instruction. In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is Jewish and lived in Israel for a time in the 1960s, said that while anti-Semitism ""must be vigorously opposed in the United States and around the world,"" the country ""must not, however, equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel."" ""What I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate. That's wrong,"" Sanders added. © Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP President Donald Trump arrives at the White House, Feb. 28, 2019. Mr. Trump, you have enormous power as President of the United States of America. You are first and foremost, Commander in Chief of the United States Military but to wield that power so as to have the greatest effect, you must have respect for the way the world’s most well-planned democratic republic was designed to work. To do that, you must show respect for all of the men and women of the House and Senate whether they are democrats or republicans, black or white, Muslim or Christian, in short Mr. Trump you must show respect for everything that flag you were hugging stands for. Calling a woman, a socialist is a fools game. Because whether they’re a man or a woman of a democracy or a dictatorship there are elements of socialism in all forms of government. When you label a person a socialist with the same disrespectful venom as one might be labeled a communist and that person is a duly elected member of Congress and a woman then you have slid out onto very thin ice Mr. Trump. Show respect for all of Congress and present a well thought out plan for securing our borders, restoring democracy to the western hemisphere and restoring responsibility for national security to the military. Don’t disrespect women Trump! There’s no future in it. A good president does not get re-elected by campaigning, a good president gets re-elected by his accomplishments. You have less than two years left to accomplish something that will secure your re-election. The quickest way you can get bipartisan support so that you can begin to have some real accomplishments in Venezuela is to end the fighting in Yemen. Call for a UN resolution to deliver aid to Yemen and if that fails come back to Congress when the dust has settled in Venezuela and ask for their support for a unilateral peace keeping mission in that war-torn country that has been seeking democracy. If you can see to it, that these countries (Now I’m including Iraq and Afghanistan since Yemen will be a new democracy.) use this opportunity to move from the problematic stepping stone of a Parliament to one executive elected by the people you will have provided them with a much more stable democratic republic. What you will have done for yourself is secured a landslide victory in 2020.“Everything’s Gonna Be Alright”By David Lee Murphy & Kenney Chesney She rattled the ice in my plastic cupI said “yes m’am”, fill her upTell me something good that I don’t know‘Cause this world’s been kicking my behindLife ain’t been a friend of mineLately I’ve been feeling kinda lowAnd she looked back over her shoulderPointed at the sign hanging up on the wallIt saidEverything’s gonna be alrightEverything’s gonna be alrightAnd nobody’s gotta worry ’bout nothingDon’t go hittin’ that panic buttonIt ain’t worth spilling your drinkEverything’s gonna be alrightAlright, alrightSo I nodded my head and said, “that’s for sure”Dropped a few bucks in the mason jarFelt those good old neon vibes on meAnd whatever monkey that was on my backHe jumped off just like thatRight into the deep blue seaAnd I looked back over her shoulderThinking ’bout the sign hanging up on the wallThat saidEverything’s gonna be alrightEverything’s gonna be alrightNobody’s gotta worry ’bout nothingDon’t go hitting that panic buttonIt ain’t near as bad as you thinkEverything’s gonna be alrightAlright, alrightThere ain’t no doubt it’s gonna work outCome on, sing it with meThere ain’t no doubt it’s gonna work out   Putin and Xi show a unified front against Trump in St. Petersburg Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN, 6/8/2019Chinese President Xi Jinping had the ultimate tour guide on his visit to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum this week: His ""bosom friend,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin released photos late Thursday of Putin showing Xi around his hometown, the former imperial capital of tsarist Russia. The Chinese leader saw works from the Renaissance collection of the State Hermitage Museum, and got an evening boat cruise with the Kremlin leader. The rest of St. Petersburg, meanwhile, seemed to be out at the cafes.But the friendly atmosphere was more than just the usual display of Russian-Chinese friendship. The St. Petersburg Economic Forum was an occasion for Putin and Xi to show a unified front in a broader confrontation with Washington. In advance of the forum, Russia and China rolled out a big announcement: On Wednesday, Huawei signed a deal with MTS -- Russia's largest telecoms operator -- to develop 5G technologies and launch a fifth-generation network in Russia.The deal comes as Huawei, one of China's most important companies, is at the center of an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington. The Trump administration has barred Huawei from any involvement in American 5G networks over spying concerns, urging US allies to follow suit, while Huawei denies that its products pose any national security risk.Ban risks 'technological war'At the St. Petersburg forum, Putin came down firmly on the side of Huawei, warning that Washington's actions risked ""technological war"" over digital technology. “Let's take the situation around Huawei, for example, which is being not only driven out but unceremoniously pushed out of the global market,"" he said. ""Some are already saying it's the first technological war of the coming digital era.""Putin also pivoted to a broader complaint: US unilateralism, something the Kremlin leader has long accused Washington of promoting. In Putin's reading, the US wants to replace a rule-based system where states are treated as equal and sovereign actors with a situation where the US and other economically powerful countries dictate the terms. ""This is what the US is doing today, trying to expand their jurisdiction over the whole world,"" he said in St. Petersburg.It's easy to see why Putin's sympathies lie with Huawei. Russia has also been on the receiving end of US sanctions following the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. Sanctions and a risky investment climate have deterred much foreign direct investment, and the Russian government has touted Chinese investment as a more reliable alternative to Western investment. But Russia's investment climate shows little hope of changing. Even as Putin was preparing to go onstage to cheer for Russian-Chinese partnership, attendees at the forum received some negative news: US investor Michael Calvey, who is currently under house arrest in connection with a controversial fraud charge in Russia, would not be attending the forum. Calvey, who has been an ardent promoter of investment in Russia, was detained in Moscow in connection with a large-scale fraud investigation this February. He was moved from jail to house arrest in April following outcry from prominent Russian CEOs and government officials, and hopes were running high that he might be allowed to attend the forum. Such a move would have been widely seen as a signal that Russia was ready to repair its image with investors. But that, in the end, did not materialize, despite the outpouring of support for Calvey. After the delegations leave St. Petersburg, then, Russia may still have to continue to look to China to boost its image as an investment destination. Tiananmen Square survivor reflects 30 years later: ""I'm heartbroken"" CBS News, 6/4/2019On June 4, 1989, Chinese tanks rolled into Beijing's Tiananmen Square to crush a student-led protest movement calling for greater political freedom. To this day, the death toll remains in dispute, but it is believed thousands may have been killed. CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer returned to Tiananmen Square 30 years later, to find its bloody history erased by modern China. Wu'er Kaixi, who at the time was 21 and was one of the main student leaders of the protests, managed to escape the violence. ""I am the survivor of a massacre,"" he told Palmer. ""I have to live with the guilt."" Although he and the students knew the government was threatened by demands for reform, he said, he thought there was ""no way"" it would come to ""real ammunition and tanks rolling over people.""   ""You never dreamed it would come to that?"" Palmer asked. ""No, no, no, no,"" he responded. Tiananmen Square is now a tourist attraction under 24/7 surveillance. Clusters of cameras, for example, are disguised as lamp posts. And the square has been completely scrubbed of anything that might recall the events of 1989. In fact, the government has so successfully written them out of history, that some young people didn't recognize the most famous Tiananmen picture of a man standing in front of a column of tanks.   ""[The] Communist party is extremely nervous about people learning the fact of what happened, which is people stood up and challenged the government,"" Wu'er Kaixi said. To make sure it never happened again, the party introduced sweeping economic changes that transformed China into a dynamic power. But at its core, it remains an authoritarian police state.   ""We failed miserably,"" he said. ""Let's face it, they are exchanging our economic freedom with our political freedom.""   The young idealist paid a personal price: he spent the next three decades in exile. ""I haven't been able to see my parents for the last 30 years,"" he said, adding ""I cannot go back to China and they denied them traveling abroad."" ""That's quite a price to pay,"" Palmer said. ""I'm heartbroken for that,"" he responded. He's also heartbroken for the reform movement, once so full of hope, that's now utterly crushed.   China expresses 'strong dissatisfaction' with U.S. statement on Tiananmen anniversary Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Paul Tait, June 3, 2019BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s embassy in the United States expressed “strong dissatisfaction” on Tuesday towards the United States’ remarks on the 30th anniversary of the Chinese government’s bloody crackdown on student-led protests in Tiananmen Square. A statement from the embassy said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments on the anniversary were made “out of prejudice and arrogance” and grossly interfered with China’s internal affairs. “China’s human rights are in the best period ever,” it said. Pompeo called on Beijing on Monday to mark the June 4 anniversary by releasing all prisoners jailed for fighting human rights abuses in China.  , He Stayed at Tiananmen to the End. Now He Wonders What It Meant. Chris Buckley, 6/4/2019                                   BEIJING — As daybreak neared on June 4, 1989, Zhou Duo walked toward the ranks of soldiers bristling with guns. Behind him, thousands of protesters huddled on Tiananmen Square, terrified that the encroaching troops would slaughter them on China’s most hallowed political ground. The soldiers had already shot wildly at incensed crowds when they stormed into Beijing that night under orders to clear the square by morning, and Mr. Zhou hoped to negotiate a path out for the demonstrators, many of them students. Mr. Zhou swallowed his fear and told a People’s Liberation Army officer: “Enough blood has flowed; there must not be any more.”Mr. Zhou was one of four young intellectuals who helped save lives by negotiating the evacuation of protesters from the square. Thirty years later, Mr. Zhou, 72, is among the few prominent actors from the protests who remain in China and continue to defend the hopes of the 1989 movement, even while agonizing over its lessons. Mr. Zhou often ponders the choices he made that culminated in the escape from Tiananmen Square. His life, closely watched by the state security officers, has become a difficult vigil for the democratic ideals that electrified the protests 30 years ago, he said. Stifling censorship has enforced a silence over those who try to keep alive the memory of the protests and massacre, and has scrubbed the internet in China of virtually any references to the upheavals. The country has become increasingly authoritarian under Xi Jinping, the leader of the ruling Communist Party, whose administration has rounded up rights lawyers, labor activists, students and Muslim ethnic minorities.“I’ve felt increasingly isolated,” Mr. Zhou said in an interview in Beijing ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. “Not many people care about June 4; young people don’t even know about it.” He was speaking in a cafe in north Beijing where other customers, eyes often fixed on their phones, seemed a world away from the talk of demonstrations and bloodshed. Mr. Zhou’s daily reality is a stark reminder of how successfully China’s ruling Communist Party has married economic growth with authoritarian rule over the past three decades, resoundingly rejecting calls for greater political freedom.But even more unexpected to Mr. Zhou were the troubles in Western countries that he admired as models of liberal democracy. The political divisions under President Trump and Britain’s Brexit shambles showed that even mature democracies could fall prey to dangerous populism and demagogy, Mr. Zhou said. “Taking it all in, you don’t see any bright spots,” he said.In 1989, Mr. Zhou was part of the “Four Gentlemen of Tiananmen,” a nickname for the group who went on a hunger strike during the demonstrations and later helped evacuate the square. The others included Liu Xiaobo, the dissident who later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while in prison for his democratic activism. Mr. Liu died a prisoner in 2017. Another, Gao Xin, left for the United States, while the fourth, Hou Dejian, a musician born in Taiwan, has retreated from dissent.Mr. Zhou spent nearly a year in detention after the 1989 crackdown, but even after his release, he is closely watched. “Now I wonder if I’ll have to live in this big prison indefinitely,” Mr. Zhou said before the security police spirited him away for the anniversary.In recent weeks, the police have taken away or put under house arrest dozens of dissidents and political activists, according to human rights groups. Among them are the organizers of Tiananmen Mothers, a group of family members of people killed or maimed in the crackdown, which issued 23 video statements from relatives who urged the Chinese government to seek forgiveness for the killings.“Thirty years have passed, and I feel that this brutal atrocity that took place under the gaze of the entire world should have been addressed long ago,” Zhang Xianling, whose teenage son, Wang Nan, was shot dead near Tiananmen Square, said in one of the videos. “This was a crime of the state.”The Tiananmen protests erupted in April 1989, when students gathered to mourn the death of Hu Yaobang, a reform-minded Communist Party leader. Their commemorations grew into a six-week-long movement, with hundreds of thousands pouring onto the square to demand greater political freedoms and an end to corruption. Mr. Zhou knew how brutal China’s politics could be. His family suffered persecution under Mao. But he also had a lot at stake in China’s future. He had worked with a famed sociologist at Peking University and then moved to a management job with an innovative Beijing electronics firm. Mr. Zhou served as an intermediary between protest leaders and moderate party officials trying to coax the students to leave the square. He formed an unlikely bond with Mr. Liu, the future Nobel Prize winner, who back then was a combative literary academic and an ardent supporter of the students. Mr. Zhou was less sure.“From start to finish, I felt conflicted, unsure about the right thing to do,” Mr. Zhou said of the protests. Then, on the night of June 3, the People’s Liberation Army swarmed into the city, and word of mass carnage reached Tiananmen Square. Time was pressing; the troops had orders to reclaim the square in hours. Mr. Zhou and his three friends tried to organize the remaining protesters to leave, but getting out was dangerous, and some wanted to stay and fight.Mr. Zhou and Mr. Hou, the musician, approached the soldiers to negotiate. Mr. Zhou begged for time and a passage to allow the protesters to leave safely. An officer agreed. Near dawn, thousands of students and residents filed off the square, some in tears, some singing or shouting defiant slogans.“A river of blood was about to flow on the square,” Mr. Zhou wrote in his memoir. “If this wasn’t a miracle, what was?”After his year in detention following the crackdown, he tried his hand at philanthropy, but the authorities made it impossible for him to keep running a charity to support poor rural teachers. Over the past three decades, Mr. Zhou has traveled abroad, including as a visiting scholar at Harvard. But the police restrictions he faced in China cut off the chances of a new career in business or teaching. Occasionally, he would weigh in on discussions about the lessons of Tiananmen.Now in retirement, Mr. Zhou lives off a pension, dividing his time between Beijing and a home in southern China, writing essays about his past and on current affairs, and giving classes in classical music, one of his lifelong loves. This week, his memoirs were published in Hong Kong, beyond the reach of Chinese censors.With age, he has become more cautious about the pathway for democracy in China. China’s middle class has grown, and many wealthier people travel abroad, but that has not brought the tilt against party control that many liberals hoped for. China’s business and intellectual elites were too compromised to challenge the party, Mr. Zhou said. “There are no domestic forces that can keep in check the Communist Party,” he said. “Its powers of control and repression, and now with the internet, high-tech, big data, artificial intelligence, facial recognition — well, the future looks more like 1984.”Mr. Zhou thinks China should pursue gradual political change leading to legal limits on power and greater political diversity. When citizens are better off and politically mature, the country will be ready to evolve into a liberal democracy, he said. “Even if a revolution overthrows the Chinese Communist Party and establishes a liberal democratic order, could it work?” he said. “It will certainly be a tortuous, slow and difficult process.” How China Pressured MSCI to Add Its Market to Major BenchmarkThe move raises questions about the independence of MSCI as the index giant wields increasing market power By Mike Bird, Feb. 3, 2019  Last summer, the world’s largest index provider added stocks in China to one of its most prominent global benchmarks, leading billions of dollars to flow into Chinese shares and advancing China’s plans to draw more foreign investors to its markets. The move by MSCI Inc. MSCI 1.52% came after it came under heavy pressure from the Chinese government, which tried to curtail the company’s business in the country, according to people familiar with the matter. MSCI’s decision to include domestic Chinese stocks in its widely followed Emerging Markets Index was received unfavorably by some investors who were concerned about robustness and transparency of markets in the world’s second-largest economy.Since the addition, Chinese stocks have stumbled, as has the global index. Yet business has boomed in China for MSCI and large global asset managers who supported its move. Regulators last year approved nine Chinese exchange-traded funds designed to track the performance of MSCI indexes, when just one existed previously. The firm is now considering quadrupling China’s weighting in the emerging-markets index, which is tracked by close to $2 trillion in assets, and a decision is expected this month. Such an increase could bring another wave of foreign money to China’s $7 trillion stock market, which was one of the world’s worst performing last year.The episode raises questions about the independence of MSCI at a time when the firm wields increasing market power, thanks in part to the rise of the “passive investing” phenomenon. In 2018, more than $13.9 trillion in investment funds had stock portfolios that mimic the composition of MSCI indexes or used them as performance yardsticks, and nearly all investments by U.S. pension funds in global stocks are benchmarked against MSCI indexes. MSCI, which has headquarters in New York, plays the role of a gatekeeper by influencing how investors around the world deploy their funds. It is also a for-profit company that collects fees from asset managers who use its indexes. MSCI’s own shares rose 11% over the past year, compared with a 5% decline in the S&P 500.MSCI said all of its index decisions are made after consultations and feedback from a wide range of global market participants, including asset owners and managers, brokers, local authorities, regulators, stock exchanges and others. The consultation process is “transparent and objective to ensure MSCI indexes remain relevant and accurate investment decision support tools for its clients,” the firm said in a statement to the Journal. The company cited safeguards including the fact that its index-inclusion process is handled by its editorial division, which is separate from its commercial operations, and based on criteria that it has made public. “MSCI acts as a conduit between local policy decision makers and international institutional investors to constructively communicate market feedback; it takes this responsibility very seriously,” it said.MSCI has long sought a larger role in China’s nascent asset-management industry. It first started operating in the country in 2005, but for years had a minuscule presence in the world’s most populous nation. In 2013, MSCI started consulting market participants and regulators on whether stocks in China should be added to its emerging-markets index. At the time, China was starting to open up its financial sector to foreign firms, creating opportunities for global asset managers to gain a foothold in its economy. There were many hurdles for China, mostly regarding foreign investors’ accessibility to Chinese stocks and limits on their ability to move money out of the market during downturns. Many Chinese companies have poor corporate governance, and investors also found problematic the capricious nature of trading suspensions in Chinese stocks that could last weeks or months.MSCI’s discussions with several Chinese asset managers were abruptly curtailed in 2015 and 2016 after the firm didn’t add Chinese-listed stocks to the emerging-markets index following its midyear reviews, according to people close to or directly involved in the discussions. The Chinese firms communicated that they had been instructed by authorities to cut off negotiations with MSCI, the people said. China’s two national stock exchanges also threatened to withdraw MSCI’s access to market pricing data, which the company provided to its customers all over the world, the people added. It was akin to “business blackmail,” said a person familiar with MSCI’s negotiations with Chinese regulatory authorities. The Shanghai Stock Exchange declined to comment, and the Shenzhen Exchange and China’s securities regulator didn’t respond to requests for comment.MSCI grades markets across 18 metrics that include capital-flow restrictions, short selling and the rights of foreign investors. Each is placed in one of three categories, ranging from “no issues” to “improvements needed.” China mostly scored in the last category, and between 2016 and 2017, none of the 18 metrics moved into a better category.nWhen MSCI decided in June 2017 to include more than 200 domestic Chinese stocks in the emerging-markets index, it said the number of suspended stocks in the market had declined. A three-year-old stock-trading link between Hong Kong and China had also made it easier for foreigners to access China’s markets. In its statement to the Journal, MSCI said that its “ultimate decision” to include stocks in China “was only following positive feedback from the investment community about the market accessibility reforms.”Many foreign investors still oppose the move. Of 155 international investors polled last year by the Asian Corporate Governance Association, nearly half felt MSCI was wrong to include domestic Chinese shares in the emerging-markets index, while only 27% said it was right to do so, the survey found. Tim Atwill, head of investment strategy at Seattle-based asset-management firm Parametric, said the ability of investors to get money in and out of China’s stock market is still very uncertain during periods of extreme turmoil. “There’s an arms race going on with the index providers,” he said, referring to competition among index companies to increase their presence in China. “That can lead to all sorts of business pressures.” China’s infiltration of U.S. capital markets is a national security concern By Josh Rogin, Columnist, June 13, 2019Editor’s note: CCP influenced entities use US consumer market as a piggy bank to fund their growth. But also our equities markets. Part of the United States’ awakening to the complex challenges posed by a rising China is the realization that America’s economic vulnerabilities are also national security vulnerabilities. And it’s not just about trade. U.S. capital markets are drastically increasing their holdings of Chinese companies, giving Beijing massive leverage inside the United States and posing huge risks to U.S. investors and the U.S. economy. This practice transfers billions of dollars out of the United States and into China, while also placing U.S. investors in the position of gambling their economic futures on Chinese companies that are beyond the reach of U.S. government oversight and accountability.For example, the world’s largest index provider, MSCI, has been steadily increasing its holdings of Chinese assets this year, reportedly “after it came under heavy pressure by the Chinese government.” MSCI will quadruple its mainland Chinese holdings this year, which will send about $80 billion of U.S. cash into the struggling Chinese economy right away.But there are greater implications. Nearly $14 trillion in U.S. investment funds follow the MSCI indexes or use them as yardsticks for their investment decisions. That means asset managers all over the country will be forced to increase their holdings of Chinese stocks and bonds. Millions of Americans, without doing anything, will soon be betting on Chinese companies with their pension funds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.Chinese law bars U.S. regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, from verifying the financial disclosures and audits submitted by Chinese companies on national security grounds. When fraudulent activity is discovered, as happens all the time, U.S. investors have no recourse.The even greater problem is that Wall Street is not even considering how national security considerations can affect the value of these Chinese companies. As the United States cracks down on Chinese firms that contribute to Beijing’s military expansion or its human rights violations, Americans are unwittingly tying their financial futures to those very companies.“We can no longer allow China’s authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets while Chinese companies avoid financial disclosure and basic transparency, and place U.S. investors and pensioners at risk,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told me. “Firms like MSCI have an obligation to make sure investors know whether their investment dollars are unwittingly aiding Chinese state-owned and state-directed companies.”Rubio sent a letter Wednesday to MSCI demanding that the index provider give Congress information on its decision to invest in several Chinese firms and increase the weighting of Chinese company shares in its indexes. For example, Rubio wants information on Hikvision, a Chinese video surveillance company that could soon be sanctioned for its role in surveillance and detention of more than 1 million Uighur Muslims inside China. If millions of Americans have invested in Hikvision, their financial interest would be set against the U.S. government’s drive to hold Chinese companies accountable for human rights violations. More broadly, Wall Street is making Americans fund China’s internal repression and Beijing’s economic strategy against the United States. “In reality, what MSCI is doing is allowing the Chinese Communist Party controlled market, and its state-owned national champion companies, to access a critical source of capital and clothe itself in a façade of legitimacy,” the letter states.Rubio is asking MSCI to provide information on how it conducted due diligence on the Chinese companies to which it is now steering investment. Does MSCI even know whether these companies are connected to the Chinese government, the People’s Liberation Army or China’s Ministry of State Security, or whether they are involved in activities such as South China Sea island building, sanctions busting, weapons production or human rights abuses? (The truth is that for all companies doing business in China, even US companies, everything that is in China, on Chinese soil, is owned by the Chinese government.) “The Rubio letter should communicate to MSCI and other fund managers that even if they are not inclined to properly account for national security and human rights-related risk associated with the Chinese companies selected for inclusion in the index, others will,” said Roger Robinson, former senior director for international economic affairs at the National Security Council and president of RWR Advisory Group, a risk management firm in Washington. “The letter also spells out the various types of national security and human rights abuses which constitute material, asymmetric risk to share value and corporate reputation and should be disclosed to prospective investors,” he said.An MSCI spokesperson told me that MSCI’s decision to increase the weight of China shares in its indexes followed an extensive consultation with international institutional investors. “Investable market benchmarks should not be constrained by specific investor opinions, preferences or constraints. This is reflected in our methodology,” the spokesperson said. There’s another good reason to reconsider transferring billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayers’ money into China; that’s investment that might otherwise go to U.S. companies to create U.S. jobs. As Joe Biden said in Iowa this week, “When it comes to taking on China, first, let’s invest in ourselves.”“It is outrageous that long-term passive investment dollars are being funneled out of the U.S. and into opaque companies that avoid routine financial audits,” said Christopher Iacovella, chief executive of the American Securities Association, which advocates for small businesses and small investors. “Senator Rubio is standing up for American investors by raising very important questions about the inclusion of some Chinese companies in stock indexes.” Wall Street is aiding the Chinese government in its effort to get Americans to fund China’s economic aggression. But the issue is now being taken out of Wall Street’s hands. Policymakers and lawmakers are going to try to force Chinese companies to play by the rules or force Wall Street to stop helping them. For Beijing, economics and national security are closely linked.The United States can no longer pretend that’s not the case. Is Putin Right? Has Liberalism Lost the World? By Patrick Buchanan, 7/20/2019 “The liberal idea has become obsolete. … (Liberals) cannot simply dictate anything to anyone as they have been attempting to do over the recent decades.” Such was the confident claim of Vladimir Putin to the Financial Times on the eve of a G-20 gathering that appeared to validate his thesis. Consider who commanded all the attention at the Osaka summit. The main event was Trump’s meeting with China’s Xi Jinping and their agreement to renew trade talks. Xi runs an archipelago of detention camps where China’s Uighur Muslims and its Kazakh minority have their minds coercively “corrected.” A major media focus at the summit was Trump’s meeting with Putin where he playfully admonished the Russian president not to meddle again in our 2020 election. The two joked about how both are afflicted with a media that generates constant fake news. At the G-20 class picture, Trump was seen smiling and shaking hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom U.S. intelligence says ordered the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump called the prince “a friend” who has done a “spectacular job.” Trump then left for Seoul, traveled to the DMZ, and crossed into North Korea to shake hands with Kim Jong Un, who runs a police state unrivaled for its repression. Negotiations on Kim's nuclear weapons may be back on track. Among other G-20 leaders present were Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Erdogan of Turkey, who has imprisoned tens of thousands following a coup attempt in July 2016. In his interview with the FT's Lionel Barber, Putin appeared as much an analyst of, as an advocate for, the nationalism and populism that seems to be succeeding the 20th-century liberalism of the West. Why is liberalism failing? Several causes, said Putin. Among them, its failure to deal with the crisis of the age: mass and unchecked illegal migration. Putin praised Trump's efforts to secure the U.S. border: ""This liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population. ... This liberal idea presupposes that ... migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected."" Putin deplored Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to bring into Germany a million refugees from Syria's civil war. His comments came as 10 Democratic candidates in the second presidential primary debate were raising their hands in support of the proposition that breaking into the USA should cease to be a crime and those who succeed in breaking in should be given free health care. Putin also sees the social excesses of multiculturalism and secularism in the West as representing a failure of liberalism. In a week where huge crowds celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall ""uprising"" in Greenwich Village, as it is now called, with parties and parades, Putin declared: ""Have we forgotten that all of us live in a world based on biblical values? ... I am not trying to insult anyone because we have been condemned for our alleged homophobia. But we have no problem with LGBT persons. God forbid, let them live as they wish."" He added, ""But some things do appear excessive to us. They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles."" Elton John pronounced himself ""deeply upset."" Putin did not back off: ""Let everyone be happy ... But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population."" Putin took power, two decades ago, as this 21st century began. In recent years, he has advanced himself not only as a foe of liberalism but a champion of populism, traditionalism and nationalism. Nor is he hesitant to declare his views regarding U.S. politics. Of Trump, Putin says, ""He is a talented person (who) knows very well what his voters expect of him. ... Trump looked into his opponent's attitude toward him and saw changes in American society."" Recalling his own controversial comment that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest tragedy of the 20th century, Putin said the tragedy was not the death of Communism but the shattering of the Russian Federation into 15 separate nations. The tragedy was the ""dispersal of ethnic Russians"" across the newly independent successor states of the Soviet Union: ""25 million ethnic Russians found themselves living outside the Russian Federation. ... Is this not a tragedy? A huge one! And family relations? Jobs? Travel? It was nothing but a disaster."" What may be said of Putin? He is no Stalin, no Communist ideologue, but rather a Russian nationalist who seeks the return of her lost peoples to the Motherland, and, seeing his country as a great power, wants NATO out of his front yard. While we have issues with him on arms control, Iran and Venezuela, we have a common interest in avoiding a war with this nuclear-armed nation as we did with the far more menacing Soviet Empire of the Cold War.CHINAhas been highly effective in destroying the reputation of the US, through its covert use of the CIA and the FBI. Although it is burdened with the -TRANCE -formation of the minds of mankind to advance its goal of total world hegemony, it has been highly effective in this respect as well. But the dream of liberty, through the establishment of democracy, remains planted deep within the hearts and minds of “THE PEOPLE” the world over, requiring that the US divest itself of the dark and bloody history of its secret agencies and to ardently nurture this “plant of rapid growth” to steal the momentum of the enemy of all that is good and decent, CHINA!Larry Jay Diamond (born October 2, 1951)[1] is an American political sociologist and leading contemporary scholar in the field of democracy studies. He is a professor of Sociology and Political Science (by courtesy) at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative policy think tank.

The CDDRL's most recent[timeframe? accomplishment came in the spring of 2011 by building a technological community between Tahrir Square (Cairo, Egypt) and Silicon Valley (California Bay Area). This community was fully focused on helping mobilize protesters in Egypt who eventually helped in the downfall of autocratic president Hosni Mubarak. Diamond has served as an advisor to numerous governmental and international organizations at various points in his life, including the United States Department of State, United Nations, World Bank, and U.S. Agency for International Development.

In 2006, Professor Diamond was among the people interviewed by the Iraq Study Group which was chaired by James Baker and Lee H. Hamilton. In his paper ""The Democratic Rollback: The Resurgence of the Predatory State,"" Diamond states that one of the main reasons for this recession in democracy is a surge of young democratic countries who employ rigged elections, intense intimidation of any opposing political party, and unstoppable expansion in executive power. What makes it worse is that many of these countries are still being accepted as democracies by western states. He cites Vladimir Putin in Russia and Hugo Chávez in Venezuela as examples. Due to the growth of these corrupted semi-democracies, which Diamond calls electoral authoritarianism, there has been a worldwide fall in the confidence in democracy, especially in developing countries. Jaw-Jaw: How Chinese Sharp Power Takes Aim at American DemocracyLarry Diamond and Brad Carson,February 5, 2019, Podcasts - Jaw-Jaw                   As Chinese power grows, Larry Diamond, the renowned scholar of democracy, breaks down Beijing’s efforts to direct “sharp power” against institutions in the United States. The key battleground appears to be American colleges, universities, and think tanks, and China’s main tool is its United Front Work Department, a critical part of the Communist Party apparatus that aims to enlist, coerce, and induce support for the party around the world. The department’s efforts involve intimidation of Chinese and ethnic Chinese students in the West, corrupting and non-transparent funding to universities, and more. Don’t miss this fascinating exploration of an important topic.BiographiesLarry Diamond is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

Elizabeth Economy, The Third Revolution: Xi Jinping and the New Chinese State, (Oxford University Press, 2018). Clive Hamilton, Silent Invasion, (Hardie Grant, 2018)Transcript:  Jaw-Jaw PodcastBrad: Larry Diamond, you co-chaired with Orville Schell of the Asia Society, a recent report on Chinese influence in American interests. Can you tell us a bit about the thesis of that report and the concerns you think it raised?Larry: It’s a report that is co-sponsored by the Hoover Institution and the Asia Society’s China program with support from Sunnylands Trust, as well. We basically are trying to raise concern, not hysteria, but intelligent, careful, thoughtful vigilant concern about China’s growing efforts to penetrate and sway our democratic institutions as it has been trying to do in Australia and New Zealand, where their efforts are much further along, in Canada and Europe and probably with less capacity to resist, in many other political systems in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. We looked at a number of sectors, Brad. We can talk about some of those and we noted different methods of approach. Some which are perfectly legitimate within what countries do in the realm of soft power, others of which we think are illegitimate in using techniques that have been called sharp power because they seek to penetrate and to use, in the language of the Australian former prime minister, methods that are covert, coercive, and corrupting and that democracy should not stand for.Brad: One of the groups you talk about in the report, you mentioned we really somewhat misunderstand, is the United Front Work Department. Can you talk about what that institution is and perhaps what it is not or what it’s more broadly representative of?Larry: It’s a part of the Chinese Communist Party that has as its formal purpose to reach out to and enlist the cooperation and loyal patriotic engagement of the Chinese diaspora around the world and to get them to see themselves as part of an extension of China, to feel pride in China, which is, in some ways, natural. Look, the United States is a conglomeration of people from many different places around the world and I think feeling pride and heritage is a good and positive thing that distinguishes the United States as a nation of immigrants, but China tries to cross the line when it tries to enlist or even coerce and intimidate Americans of Chinese descent and particularly recent immigrants to do more explicitly the bidding of China in terms of its foreign policy aims and there’ve even been instances that have been documented of Chinese émigrés to the United States who’ve been subject to intimidation and Chinese émigrés elsewhere in the world and Chinese overseas residents including students whose family members in China are pressured if they don’t tow the line. The United Front Work Department is part of a larger structure of Chinese influence operations around the world that seeks to build friendships and alliances and partnerships that see the world through China’s eyes and that try to influence the policies of their countries, in this case, the United States, to be receptive to China’s rise and to be silent about China’s global ambitions that might, for example, its claim to all of the South China Sea that might contradict the national security objectives and interests of, in this case, the United States. One should see the United Front Work Department, Brad, as part of a classic Leninist structure of trying to build alliances abroad and use them, again, often in a kind of coercive and covert way that compromises the integrity of democratic institutions.Brad: Well you talk about a lot of different aspects of American society from academia to think tanks to businesses. I’d kind of like to talk about each of those. Let’s start with academia where the Confucius Institutes of which you note in the report, there are now more than 100 in the United States as well as some similar organizations that are in secondary schools and they’ve been very controversial. Some places have outright banned them. You have a more nuanced view of that in the report though. Can you tell us, for the listeners, what should they think about Confucius Institutes, both the possible pitfalls as well as the opportunities they might provide for meaningful interaction and training?Larry: The purpose ostensibly of Confucius Institutes is to provide resources, both financial resources and human resources, in the form of Chinese language instructors from China, from Chinese universities and Chinese instructional, language instructional materials, that would enable particularly universities that might not have the resources to mount a significant Chinese language instruction program on their own to teach Chinese language. Our point is that looking at the curriculum, the written curriculum of the Chinese language instruction books, the China experts in our working group who’ve examined them, don’t see anything particularly objectionable. So the concerns, Brad, arise around the edges of all of this and some of the edges that kind of raise concern are the following.First and foremost, the contracts between the central institution in China, within the Ministry of Education, that manages and runs all the Confucius Institutes, something called the Hanban, the contracts between the Hanban and each individual American college or university are not transparent. They’re secret agreements that are not open to the wide knowledge and general inspection of faculty, students, alumni and so on. We view this as completely unacceptable and so if the Confucius Institutes arrangements are going to remain, they just need to be above board and you can’t have secret commitments to not discuss this subject or not have a speaker about Tibet or Taiwan or whatever it might be, that faculty aren’t able to inspect and evaluate.Brad: Let me just ask a question about that, if I could. Is the concern there that a contract, which would be entered in between a university administration, for example, and the Chinese government or Hanban, that maybe the administration would agree to something that the faculty themselves would say this contradicts free inquiry and open expression.Larry: Yeah, basically. That’s the concern.Brad: Is there any evidence that that’s happening at Confucius Institutes?Larry: Well, we can’t see the agreements, so we don’t know. But it’s a matter of general principle that secret agreements with an authoritarian foreign government should be unacceptable. And it’s a matter of documented fact that Chinese authorities, Chinese consular officials, the Chinese Embassy has pressured American universities not to have the Dalai Lama visit, not to have speakers on certain subjects and of more concern to us than the Confucius Institutes, if this issue of transparency can be resolved, is the Chinese Students and Scholars Associations. These are chapters on different American and other college campuses …Brad: More than 150 U.S. campuses, you write in the report.Larry: That’s right, thank you for reading our report very carefully. That and in many other countries around the world, where if you have a significant number of Chinese overseas students, they establish one of these Chinese Students and Scholars Associations and then they get instructions and funding from the Chinese Consulate in their area or, if they’re near Washington, the Chinese Embassy. And again, these are not at all transparent and might involve reporting on what Chinese students are saying and writing and possibly expressing their open and free intellectual inquiry about that could put them at risk when they return to China. If they are being critical of Chinese government policy, might get back to their families and result in Chinese government pressure on their families back home.No Chinese foreign student in the United States should need to live in fear that they’re being monitored by some designated student observers or minders or monitors and are at risk of being punished in some way for the questions they ask or the statements they make or the things they want to discover and know. And no collection of Chinese students through an organization like this on an American university campus should be taking non-transparent money from their government, I’d say, or from any foreign government to push a government line or protest a university visitor or something like that.Brad: You talk about a number of incidents in the report, they usually involve a controversy about, as you mentioned, the Dalai Lama, Xinjiang, Tibet, sometimes Taiwan, that those are areas that are verboten, really, for universities to get involved in and that the Chinese government will retaliate against universities that invite speakers who might have a position that’s contrary to the Chinese Communist Party.Larry: Yes, that’s right, Brad. Those have been the kind of lightning rods for Chinese protests, but if it’s these today, and if these forms of pressure and censorship of free inquiry and open debate on American university campuses are happening now and those are bad enough, and they get away with it, who knows what might be the subject of future Chinese government pressure and censorship. I think the line needs to be vigorously drawn, that when a student from any country, I don’t care if it’s China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran or any other country in the world, is on American soil on an American college campus, they ought to have the same rights of free and open expression and discovery and intellectual inquiry and association that any other student in the United States has.Brad: Could we tease it out just a little bit and let me play devil’s advocate for a moment if I could, and that is how is what the Chinese government’s doing … So for example, in the case you write about where the University of California at San Diego invited the Dalai Lama to give a commencement address, the Chinese government threatened to no longer send students to UCSD. UCSD went through with the speech and the Chinese did, in fact, follow through on their threat. How is that different than what we see all across the country today where, for example, various corporate interests may be sponsoring something, if the students or the faculty or someone protests, the corporation may say, well we choose not to continue to fund or subsidize our involvement with the school. And I know many faculty members don’t like that kind of thing, but it happens probably all the time. How is this different when the Chinese are doing it?Larry: Well, first of all it’s a government. It’s not a corporation. This is a government that’s a lot more powerful than most corporations and second of all, this is not just a government, it’s a government that has large numbers of people, over 300,000 studying in American universities around the United States and the human rights of those 300,000 people are at risk in terms of freedom of expression. That’s a lot of people to have their human rights be at risk, and our principle point is that should not happen to any students in the United States of America, whether they’re from China or from the United States or from any other country.Brad: Is it possible to distinguish that, such as covert intelligence collection on Chinese students, which does seem beyond the pale, from the government saying, “We’re not going to surveil our students, but we’re not going to send any students on our dime to your school if you choose to invite somebody like the Dalai Lama who, in the Chinese Communist Party’s eyes, is not a legitimate representative and foments discord there.Larry: These students, Brad, are not coming on the Chinese government’s dime; they’re coming on their families’ dimes. And it says something about the level of authoritarianism in China that they would be able to and, indeed, they are able to turn off the flow of students even with families’ private money. So it speaks to how centralized and over-awing the control of an increasingly, once again, authoritarian Chinese Communist Party state we are dealing with now.Brad: You also talk a lot about business in the U.S. from Chinese-Americans and increasingly, many Chinese-Americans have economic interests tied up with Mainland China, some have made fortunes related to business activities in Asia and the ability to manipulate perhaps these kind of folks. The question, I think, there that raised for me about it was, yes, we have these Chinese Chambers of Commerce, if you will, and if you could talk a bit about how they’re susceptible to Chinese Communist Party influence and then also how they might differ from many nations around the world, many diaspora populations will have a chamber of commerce, an Armenian Chamber of Commerce or a group of businessmen, many of whom have ties to their home country and business interests there and no doubt find a bit of a conflict in advocating for that. How is the Chinese Chambers of Commerce, if you will, different than that?Larry: I think you’ve got to start with the structure, and the way the Chinese Communist Party system works. It’s still, this is what I need to and what we, as a working group, find ourselves needing to keep emphasizing over and over. This is still a communist system run on Leninist principles of a highly centralized direction with a strong international mission of penetration and central direction toward that end. We tend to think in the United States that if you have a business that’s a private enterprise, it’s private, it’s separate from the government. If you have a think tank, or an association that is not part of the government, then it must be independent of the government.The problem is, in China, the Communist Party state is so penetrating and so controlling and so demanding of ultimate obedience and subjugation that nobody is fully independent from the party and the state, and everybody can be bent to the will of the party state and threatened with very severe consequences if they don’t respond to direction. When you have a local Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the United States from a city or a province or a collection generally in a certain American city, the question at least has to be asked, as to whether they are responding to a party direction when they advocate something or say something or promote something or pursue something in the United States. And when you then have evidence, which we cite in the report, of party publications or something taking pride in a position or advocacy or achievement of some local chamber of commerce in the United States, Chinese Chamber of Commerce, it raises questions and at least merits further, closer inspection and awareness of the possibility that they’re not fully independent actors.Brad: You also talk in the report about think tanks and the influence of Chinese money into them. One example you give is the Center at Yale for the Study of China, which was funded by a graduate of Yale Law School, Chinese, big investor in Alibaba, billionaires. Is that something that when we read reports from think tanks that deal with China, that we should be skeptical of reading them or look at them at least with a jaundiced eye to think who’s funding this? Maybe it’s Taiwan, maybe it’s Mainland China, maybe it’s indirect influence from Chinese businessmen who themselves suffer from great conflicts.Larry: Well, I’d say that universities, think tanks, NGOs, first of all have an obligation to be transparent about funding, particularly from foreign sources and second of all, need to do due diligence on who their interlocutors are who might be coming to them with proposals for generous philanthropic support. We’re not suggesting in the case of this individual that anything is wrong, off-kilter, we’re simply giving examples of a growing trend. The thing that we’re most concerned about with respect to think tanks, Brad, is the possibility of self-censorship. When think tanks become increasingly dependent on funding from the People’s Republic of China, even from putatively, entirely private sources, and then they start asking, “Well, if we pursue this line of research, if we publish this report, if we host this scholar or speaker, what’s it going to do in the future to our ability to raise money from China or to continue to be receiving money from certain Chinese sources,” and our research demonstrated that a number of think tanks concede that they do ask these questions and even individual think tank scholars and university-based scholars and even our own working group members conceded that they themselves struggle with these issues and questions of whether they have to phrase things in a certain way or hold back a little bit.In this case, with respect to individual scholars, not so much in order to get funding, but just to be able to get into China, to get a visa and if you get a visa, to get access to government officials and think tanks and university interlocutors to be able to do research and learn about what’s happening in China and we worry that, first of all, this is not a healthy situation in terms of enabling fully free expression and inquiry, and second of all it’s not a fair situation because Chinese researchers and think tanks face none of these restrictions in the United States and so we want a more reciprocal and level playing field in terms of Americans having the access in China that Chinese have in the United States.Brad: One of the questions, which I asked earlier, playing a bit of a devil’s advocate, is lots of the think tanks in Washington, DC, around the country take money from foreign governments. The New York Times ran big reports about how the Norwegians were funding research at Brookings and things. It comes back to what China’s doing. In some ways reading your report I was taking away that they were engaged in that much activity that other countries weren’t either doing, chambers of commerce, or think tank dollars, it’s that the Chinese are a different kind of government. It’s not that they’re doing anything like maybe the Russians are, which is subterfuge or illegal or manipulative. It’s that they realize how the American system works, and they’re playing it in the same way the Norwegians are. The difference is that China is now … We have hardening attitudes towards its authoritarian regime. Would you agree with that summary or do you think that I don’t quite have it right there?Larry: Well, I think there are valid aspects to what you say, but I would tweak it in the following ways. Number one, I just think there’s a huge gulf of difference between the way other democracies support foreign intellectual work in think tanks and universities and issue grants and so on. I would even … Look, I have been involved with the program to study democracy in Taiwan and the surrounding region that has received support from the Taiwan Foreign Ministry, and I know they never put any conditions on us on what we could say or report, and we produced books and articles that have been quite critical of Taiwan government policies. That’s unthinkable with respect to the People’s Republic of China, but it’s typical of what other democracies do in terms of the way they provide financial support for projects. And if the Norwegians want to study, support a program in the United States to study climate change or human rights in Africa or poverty in the developing world, I just don’t think you can begin to equate it with the way that China is using its money in the think tank world.I think there’s a really fundamental difference here. At the same time I would say that a lot of what China’s doing is similar to certainly the way the Russian oligarchs have been compromising the integrity of think tanks, the way Saudi Arabia and Qatar, perhaps, have been trying to do so. I think the gulf is, to some considerable extent, between democracies and authoritarian states in how they use their foreign funding.Brad: One particularly shocking story in your report deals with the venerable Voice of America, which seems to be completely corrupted, can you talk a bit about Voice of America and how it has been voluntarily kind of censored itself in broadcasting into China.Larry: You’ve basically said it. I’d like to think that this is a partial and limited development. Certainly Radio Free Asia, I think, has had a more extensive willingness to be critical, but the most serious problem is not with the Voice of America on the media front, the most serious problem is what’s happening in our own countries. We document in Australia, now here in the United States, where American citizens who wish to listen to news and programming in the Chinese language on Chinese language radio stations, some cable television stations, and in Chinese language print media, are having their freedom and pluralism of information vastly constricted by what appears to be a concerted effort to basically buy up the Chinese language media and tilt them to a pro-Chinese Communist Party line. On the media front, Brad, I think this is far and away the most disturbing aspect of what’s happening.Brad: And should the U.S. prohibit those in some way? A CFIUS-style process to media organizations, because you do outline in there how many Chinese language papers that serve the immigrant community, first generation community have been bought up by Mainland China interests that used to be perhaps owned by Taiwanese or Chinese-Americans themselves and how now PRC interests own them. Is that something we should prohibit?Larry: I think we should look at it fairly carefully in the future. I don’t think you can seize the existing ones, but I do think we should look at it in the future and indeed, the Chinese efforts to buy up American language radio stations have been blocked and it’s why the Chinese ultimately turned to buying … This is a great story, a radio station in Tijuana, [Baja] California, just over the border from San Diego with one of the largest transmitting wattages in all of North America to broadcast from Tijuana because they couldn’t get a radio station in Southern California. I think that we should be looking at this very carefully. I would also say, Brad, I would actually favor, this is my personal recommendation, not a working group recommendation, some kind of charitable foundation to ensure, not government, because once you start getting into media stuff, you gotta keep U.S. government hands off it in the domestic market but some sort of nonprofit foundation to ensure that there’s adequate pluralism and maybe a Chinese language version of National Public Radio to ensure that people in the United States, citizens and non-citizens who wish to get news and information in the Chinese language have adequate access to alternative perspectives including ones that are not controlled the U.S. government, but are certainly not feeling more or less deferential to the Chinese Communist Party line either.Brad: Later this year you’re going to have a book come out entitled, Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition and American Complacency. Does it build on the things that the Hudson Institution report talked about as well and can you talk a bit about what Chinese ambition is and why you see Americans as complacent to it?Larry: Again, this is a report of the Hoover Institution and my book, yes, does very much expand upon the larger problem, which is not only a Chinese problem, but a Russian problem of authoritarian state efforts to project sharp power, not in a way to persuade but to cut into, penetrate, and subvert the integrity of democratic institutions around the world in the United States and Europe and in many other emerging democracies, and it calls not just for the constructive vigilance that we do in the report, Brad, but also more robust efforts to, as you say, strengthen Foreign Agent Registration Act, strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, strengthen precautions against illicit technology transfer. Beyond that, my book argues what I think you would be sympathetic to, that if we’re going to win what is an increasingly robust competition with authoritarian states now led by China to shape a very different kind of world, we’ve really got to reform our own democratic institutions and make them work better, more transparently, and more cooperatively to address our own problems.You can’t beat something with nothing and if our democracy doesn’t become more effective, less polarized and more democratic, I think that we will be hard pressed to rebuff the rising challenge of authoritarian states around the world.Brad: We will put a link to Ill Winds on the website where people can pre-order that for its release in May of 2019. We always end “Jaw-Jaw” by asking people to recommend anything they think people interested in China might be eager to pick up. What would recommend to folks who want to learn more about the issues that you study and are concerned about?Larry: I would recommend two books, in addition to mine. One is the wonderful book that Clive Hamilton wrote in Australia called, Silent Invasion which talks about China’s efforts to penetrate Australian society and political economy and then I would certainly recommend the new book of one of our leading working group members, Elizabeth Economy, The Third Revolution: Xi Jinping and the New Chinese State, which is an extraordinarily perceptive and, I think, balanced survey of China’s rise and continued ascendance under Xi Jinping, some of the forward steps it’s taking and fighting corruption and projecting global power but some of the dark side, too, in terms of the advance of authoritarianism and an Orwellian surveillance state.Brad: Larry Diamond, one of the world leading scholars on democracy. We eagerly await your book and thank you for being a guest on Jaw tonight.Larry: Well thank you, Brad, for having me, and for taking our report so seriously. “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.” ― Franklin D. Roosevelt  Peter Navarro says US will take strong action against China if it devalues yuan to ‘neutralize tariffs’, by Kate Rooney, 8/10/2019          White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said Beijing plans to devalue its currency — and if it does, the U.S. will respond forcefully. “They’re going to and we’re going to take strong action against them,” Navarro told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Friday. “Clearly they are manipulating their currency from a trade point of view.” Earlier this week, China allowed its currency to drop against the dollar to a key level unseen since 2008. The Trump administration later labeled Beijing a “currency manipulator. ” Navarro said China was taking actions to deal with the effects of tariffs. “China has devalued its currency by over 10% with the express purpose of neutralizing tariffs, full stop,” Navarro said. Last week, President Donald Trump abruptly ended a cease-fire with China by announcing 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods last, claiming China failed to buy U.S. farm goods as it promised. The trade war continued to boil over this week as China announced it would stop buying American agricultural products in retaliation for Trump’s surprise tariffs threat. On Friday, President Donald Trump also said that the U.S. government will no longer do business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Navarro insisted that China, not U.S. consumers, will bear the financial burden of increased tariffs. “China will bear virtually the entire burden of that through the currency manipulation and by slashing prices,” he said. “China is the one that suffers far more harm than what might be inflicted on us.” Over the next couple of months, Navarro said White House officials plan to have the Chinese negotiators back to the U.S. to negotiate.  Trump moves to end asylum protections for Central Americans, 7/15/2019, AP  The Trump administration on Monday moved to end asylum protections for most Central American migrants in a major escalation of the president’s battle to tamp down the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. According to a new rule published in the Federal Register, asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the U.S. southern border. The rule, expected to go into effect Tuesday, also applies to children who have crossed the border alone. There are some exceptions: If someone has been trafficked, if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed (though most Western countries have signed them) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied, then a migrant could still apply for U.S. asylum. But the move by President Donald Trump’s administration was meant to essentially end asylum protections as they now are on the southern border. The policy is almost certain to face a legal challenge. U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive at the U.S. regardless of how they did so, but there is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be “safe.” But the Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs asylum law, is vague on how a country is determined “safe”; it says “pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement.” Right now, the U.S. has such an agreement, known as a “safe third country,” only with Canada. Under a recent agreement with Mexico, Central American countries were considering a regional compact on the issue, but nothing has been decided. Guatemalan officials were expected in Washington on Monday, but apparently a meeting between Trump and Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a safe third with the U.S. The new rule also will apply to the initial asylum screening, known as a “credible fear” interview, at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country. It applies to migrants who are arriving to the U.S., not those who are already in the country. Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. But immigrant rights groups, religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration’s policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence. Along with the administration’s recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border , Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum, and Attorney General William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out. Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts. Meanwhile, conditions have worsened for migrants who make it over the border seeking better lives. Tens of thousands of Central American migrant families cross the border each month, many claiming asylum. The numbers have increased despite Trump’s derisive rhetoric and hard-line immigration policies. Border facilities have been dangerously cramped and crowded well beyond capacity. The Department of Homeland Security’s watchdog found fetid, filthy conditions for many children. And lawmakers who traveled there recently decried conditions. Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases, meaning many people won’t have their asylum claims heard for years despite more judges being hired. People are generally eligible for asylum in the U.S. if they feared return to their home country because they would be persecuted based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group. During the budget year for 2009, there were 35,811 asylum claims, and 8,384 were granted. During 2018 budget year, there were 162,060 claims filed, and 13,168 were granted. “Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.” ― Franklin D. Roosevelt   If you’re a good worker, papers don’t matter’: How a Trump construction crew has relied on immigrants without legal status,Josh Partlow, David Fahrenthold, 8/9/2019OSSINING, N.Y. —For nearly two decades, the Trump Organization has relied on a roving crew of Latin American employees to build fountains and waterfalls, sidewalks and rock walls at the company’s winery and its golf courses from New York to Florida. Other employees at Trump clubs were so impressed by the laborers — who did strenuous work with heavy stone — that they nicknamed them “Los Picapiedras,” Spanish for “the Flintstones.” For years, their ranks have included workers who entered the United States illegally, according to two former members of the crew. Another employee, still with the company, said that remains true today. President Trump “doesn’t want undocumented people in the country,” said one worker, Jorge Castro, a 55-year-old immigrant from Ecuador without legal status who left the company in April after nine years. “But at his properties, he still has them.” Castro said he worked on seven Trump properties, most recently Trump’s golf club in Northern Virginia. He provided The Washington Post with several years of his pay stubs from Trump’s construction company, Mobile Payroll Construction LLC, as well as photos of him and his colleagues on Trump courses and text messages he exchanged with his boss, including one in January dispatching him to “Bedminster,” Trump’s New Jersey golf course. Another immigrant who worked for the Trump construction crew, Edmundo Morocho, said he was told by a Trump supervisor to buy fake identity documents on a New York street corner. He said he once hid in the woods of a Trump golf course to avoid being seen by visiting labor union officials. The hiring practices of the little-known Trump business unit are the latest example of the chasm between the president’s derisive rhetoric about immigrants and his company’s long-standing reliance on workers who cross the border illegally. And it raises questions about how fully the Trump Organization has followed through on its pledge to more carefully scrutinize the legal status of its workers — even as the Trump administration launched a massive raid of undocumented immigrants, arresting about 680 people in Mississippi this week. In January, Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons and a top Trump Organization executive, told The Post that the company was “making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment,” saying any such individuals would be immediately fired. He also said the company was instituting E-Verify, a voluntary federal program that allows employers to check the immigration status of new hires, “on all of our properties as soon as possible.” And the company began auditing the legal status of its existing employees at its golf courses, firing at least 18. But nothing changed on the Trump construction crew, according to current and former employees. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said Mobile Payroll Construction is enrolled in E-Verify for any new hires. The company is still not listed in the public E-Verify database, which was last updated July 1. The company did not directly respond to requests for comment about the legal status of the Mobile Construction workers, but said in a statement that “since this issue was first brought to our attention, we have taken diligent steps, including the use of E-Verify at all of our properties and companies.” “Those efforts continue and where an employee is found to have provided fake or fraudulent documentation to unlawfully gain employment, that individual will be terminated. Fortunately, among the thousands of individuals employed by our organization, we have encountered very few instances where this has occurred,” the statement said. The White House declined to comment. The president, who still owns the Trump Organization but has turned over day-to-day operations to his eldest sons, said last month that he does not know if it employs workers who entered the country illegally. “Well, that I don’t know. Because I don’t run it,” Trump told reporters. “But I would say this: Probably every club in the United States has that, because it seems to me, from what I understand, a way that people did business.” Since January, The Post has interviewed 43 immigrants without legal status who were employed at Trump properties. They include waiters, maids and greenskeepers, as well as a caretaker at a personal hunting lodge that his two adult sons own in Upstate New York. In all, at least eight Trump properties have employed immigrants who entered the United States illegally, some as far back as 19 years, The Post has found. As president, Trump has launched a crusade against illegal immigration, describing Latino migrants as criminals who are part of an “invasion.” Such remarks drew renewed criticism after Saturday’s mass shooting in El Paso, which is under investigation as a hate crime targeting Mexicans and immigrants. While poverty and violence have pushed thousands to leave Latin America, U.S. businesses that employ undocumented workers are also a major driver of illegal immigration, experts say. By employing workers without legal status, the Trump Organization has an advantage over its competitors, particularly at a time when the economy is strong and the labor market tight, according to industry officials. Undocumented employees are less likely to risk changing jobs and less likely to complain if treated poorly. “Nobody’s going to go and complain and say, ‘He’s not providing me with health insurance. He’s not providing me with this or that,’ ” said Alan Seidman, who heads an association of construction contractors in New York’s Hudson Valley, where Trump has a golf course. “They stay below the radar.” The laborers hired by the Trump construction unit — several who live in suburbs north of New York City — are typically dispatched by Trump construction supervisors to different jobs, driving sometimes hundreds of miles to a golf course or resort, according to the current and former employees. Over the years, some passed weeks or months away from home, bunking in buildings at Trump’s properties, they said. Their supervisors have paid little attention to their immigration status, even after Trump launched a campaign built around the threat of immigrants and then used his presidency to crack down on border crossings, workers said. “If you’re a good worker, papers don’t matter,” Castro said. Trump interacted personally with some of the construction workers before he was president — greeting employees by name and commenting on minor details of their work, according to Luis Sigua, an immigrant from Ecuador who is still part of the crew. Sigua posted a photo in December 2014 on his Facebook page of himself standing on a golf course next to Trump, who is grinning and giving a thumbs-up. Sigua declined to share his immigration status, but confirmed that some members of the construction unit did not have proper documentation: “Some yes, some no.” “Politics is nothing to me,” he added. “The work is everything.” 'Nobody had papers' Trump’s itinerant construction crew evolved from an outfit that used to be run by Frank Sanzo, an Italian American stonemason from Yonkers who met Trump in the late 1990s. Sanzo was building a stone wall at the Westchester County home of former New York Knicks basketball coach Rick Pitino when Trump stopped by to talk to him one day, Sanzo described in an interview last month at his home in Yonkers, N.Y. “I’m Donald Trump,” Sanzo recalled Trump telling him. “I know who you are,” Sanzo said he replied. Trump had purchased a country club out of foreclosure in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., in 1996 and began renovating the golf course and building dozens of homes and condominiums. The project required extensive masonry work to build the stone walls, chimneys and columns on the clubhouse and new homes. Sanzo said Trump hired him to oversee a crew of immigrants who worked on the project for several years. Morocho said he was one of those laborers. He joined the crew of roughly 15 people in 2000. He said he earned $15 an hour, working Monday through Saturday. “Nobody had papers,” Morocho said. In fact, Morocho recalled, Sanzo instructed the crew to buy fake Social Security numbers and green cards in New York so they would have something to put in the Trump Organization files. Morocho said he bought his papers for $50 in 2002. “Frank said, ‘You can go buy a social in Queens. They sell them in Queens. Then come back to work. It’s no problem,’ ” Morocho said. “He knew.” In 2002, Morocho recalled, New York labor union officials visited Trump’s Westchester golf club to see the construction site and Sanzo told the immigrant crew to hide for a couple of hours until they left. “We stayed behind some trees,” he said. In a phone interview this week, Sanzo said he did not remember Morocho. When asked whether he told employees to buy fake documents, Sanzo’s wife, Bernice, interrupted: “How would Frank know where to get that stuff?” Sanzo added, “They can get them on the street, too.” He did not directly address the question. During the interview at his home last month, when asked about the legal status of his workers, Sanzo replied: “Most of my guys were legal.” He was interrupted by his wife. “Do not answer any questions, because it’s going to be misleading,” Bernice Sanzo admonished her husband, telling two Post reporters: “Trump was not involved in that, in the hiring. My husband was.” “Most of them were legal,” Frank Sanzo said again. He said he often hired immigrant workers who returned to their home countries and needed to be replaced and accepted the documents they gave him. “They gave me a social and a license. I put them on the payroll,” Sanzo said. “I don’t know if they were legal or not.” The longtime stonemason, who retired in 2014 and is now blind, spoke fondly about his work for Trump and their trips together to Mets and Yankees games. Sid Liebowitz, who was the Trump Organization’s director of purchasing from 2004 to 2013, said he worked closely with Sanzo on many of his jobs — supplying materials, but not dealing with hiring or payroll. Although Trump often had very detailed input on Sanzo’s projects, Liebowitz said he believes Sanzo did not consult the real estate developer about his employees. “If he was hiring people that were illegal . . . Donald certainly wouldn’t know,” Liebowitz said. “Because Donald was in New York and Frank was traveling around the country.” As Trump expanded his golf course holdings, he tapped Sanzo’s team to assist with rock walls, fountains and cart path bridges, according to building permits and former workers. The construction crew sometimes stayed for months on a property, bunking in buildings on-site or in Trump’s hotels, former workers said. “I used to take the crew state to state,” Sanzo said. At the Trump golf course in Sterling, Va., Sanzo’s workers built a $35,000 man-made waterfall with an observation deck overlooking the Potomac River in 2011, according to Loudoun County building permits. Building permits with Sanzo’s name also show his laborers built a $35,000 retaining wall and a $165,000 pool house for the club in 2011. Sanzo appears in a Trump Organization “before and after” video from 2015 that showed Trump’s son Eric discussing planned renovations for the Trump Winery near Charlottesville. As part of that project, Sanzo’s team helped renovate the previous owner’s carriage house into a wedding venue and convert the estate’s main house into a boutique hotel, according former workers and winery employees. While on the job, the crew lived in a staff house inside the winery’s gated property, cooking their own meals, according to former workers. To the English-speaking bosses, Sanzo’s workers were reliable but largely anonymous. “I think they were Ecuadoran,” said one former manager at Trump’s Westchester club who recalled seeing them monthly and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution. “They were just known as ‘Sanzo’s crew.’ ” In May 2015, as Trump began ramping up his presidential run, the construction crew got a new legal name: Mobile Payroll Construction, a new company that was registered by a Trump executive, according to corporate filings. The sole owner is Trump, according to his personal financial disclosures. The workers said little changed except for their paychecks, which once came from other Trump entities and now came from Mobile Payroll Construction. A Trump Organization construction manager named John Gruber, who had taken over the team after Sanzo retired, continued as their boss. Gruber did not respond to requests for comment. Early this year, amid news reports that Trump’s clubs employed workers without legal status, the Trump Organization began firing them from its golf courses. Among those let go was Morocho, who by then had left the construction crew for a full-time maintenance job at Trump’s Westchester golf club. But at Mobile Payroll Construction, there was no scrutiny of the workers’ immigration status, according to Castro. He said his bosses didn’t even mention it. “It was like it didn’t happen,” he said. 'Go to Bedminster' Castro said an assignment would typically begin with a message from Gruber, dispatching him to golf clubs across the Northeast. “Hi Mr John happy New year,” Castro texted Gruber on Jan. 3, 2018. “Can you please let me know when I have to go back to work? Thank you.” “Happy New Year,” Gruber replied. “Go to Bedminster tomorrow.” Earlier this year, Castro asked Gruber for time off. “Good morning Mr John. I have a question for you. Can I take my other week of vacation,” he texted on April 12. “I need you to work next week,” Gruber responded. Before he joined Trump’s crew, Castro had been a banana farmer in an Andean village outside of Cuenca, Ecuador. He said he left home in 2007 hoping to earn more for his wife and five children and hired a smuggler to ferry him across the U.S.-Mexico border. Three years later, in Miami, he found work doing construction for the Trump Organization through Sigua, a fellow Ecuadoran. Castro said little was required to start working. His colleagues who were also undocumented, he said, helped him fill out the paperwork. When he was first hired in 2010, he said he initially provided the Trump Organization with a fake Social Security number. In 2015, he said, he gave the company a valid “Individual Tax Identification Number” issued by the Internal Revenue Service. “They said that was sufficient,” he recalled. The IRS issues such ITIN numbers to documented and undocumented immigrants. Employers are instructed not to accept them as proof of legal status, said Anastasia Tonello, a New York attorney who is the head of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It doesn’t even check one of the boxes” for an employer verifying a new hire’s immigration status, said Tonello. If any employer accepted such a document, she said, “they wouldn’t be taking [the process] very seriously.” The U.S. government says that employers must accept only immigration and identity documents that “reasonably appear to be genuine.” The laborers who worked for the roving construction crew were familiar with the style that Trump used at his properties. They knew which carpet Trump wanted in his ballrooms and that walls should be painted a certain shade of eggshell white that Trump had seen on a visit one day to Sanzo’s daughter’s home, according to Sanzo.  “You’re paying for the convenience of having these individuals that didn’t have to be trained,” said a former manager at Trump’s golf course in Colts Neck, N.J., who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his privacy. By using in-house workers, the Trump Organization could also avoid some permitting costs on their project. And undocumented employees are less likely to demand better pay or jump to competing employers, industry experts said. Trump “was saving a lot of money with us,” said Castro, whose paychecks show that he made $19 an hour beginning in 2016, which increased to $21 an hour in 2018. He said he did not get health insurance or other benefits. Castro’s attorney, Anibal Romero, said he had filed a complaint with the New York Labor Department — and planned to file another with the federal Labor Department — alleging that Castro was denied some overtime wages and health benefits because he was undocumented. Castro’s salary matches the hourly mean wage of stonemasons in the New York area, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But one former carpenter on Trump’s construction unit said he now earns twice his former salary doing similar work for a union crew. “The salary for that work was very low,” said the carpenter, who said that after working for Trump for 12 years — from 2006 to 2018 — his salary increased by only $5 per hour, to a final rate of $19 per hour. “That’s why I left.” The work was often grueling: long hours under the sun laying bricks or breaking rocks or digging trenches.  “To compare it to the company where I’m working now, this is much better,” said the carpenter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about Trump. But he said he values the skills and experience he gained. “To work in the Trump company, for me, I learned a lot,” he said. “When I started, I didn’t know much. I couldn’t even speak English.” Since Trump was elected, the pace of his company’s acquisitions and renovations slowed considerably. His properties also began relying more on outside contractors who would bring in their own employees, according to former members of the in-house crew. What used to be a crew of 25 to 30 workers has dropped to fewer than 10, they say. Trump’s construction crew now does mostly routine fix-it tasks or minor renovations, according to one current and two former construction workers. Sigua, who currently lives in Miami, said some weeks he does maintenance work at Trump’s National Doral resort, and then goes elsewhere. “We don’t stay in one place,” he said.  Donald Trump is a man of common sense, how could he be otherwise, having been raised in the construction trades? But Donald Trump is a man of uncommon deep knowledge of the effects of the Feds percentage rates and what it means to be a monetary manipulator. He also has uncommon knowledge of the power of tariffs when negotiating with foreign countries. The problem is that the RNC did not support even a 5% tariff on Mexico. I believe Donald Trump will see the fairness of an across the board 15% tariff on all products coming into the country when the dealing is done. I call on the people of this country to help Donald Trump overcome the RNC and the CIA and the FBI and get rid of the minders like Elliot Abrams, John Bolton, Mike Pence and William Barr. I know Barr did a great job getting Mueller to move on but now he is advising you to withhold tax returns. This doesn’t sound like a man that loves Wikileaks. I encourage you to roll the dice and let the chips fall where they may! Have faith in the common sense of the people, and make your tax documents available to the public, the people will appreciate the openness and prove it come election day. They were accepted by the IRS and they will be accepted by the people. Identifying the best educated for citizenship has a dark side with the likes of the CIA  and the FBI are still carrying out this kind of work. It makes no sense when we need people willing to work at every skill level and there is so much work to be done. If we can make the changes to the county, state and federal government described in this document, we can begin paying off the national debt in big chunks and have plenty of money at the county level to pay for the small infrastructure jobs that need to be done. There will be plenty of money at the state level for the states to pay for the midsized  infrastructure jobs. Most important of all, there will be plenty of money at the federal level to take on the really big infrastructure jobs and build new embassies around the world that are extremely secure in every way, especially when it comes to cyber security. Let me outline what I have in mind for more secure embassy communication systems by describing how it can be done in this country at the state and county level. Each state would deploy its own secure satellite responsible for handling the communications of that state, or more than one for larger states. Each county would have a centrally located secure tower that communicates with the satellite. All communications within the county would be transmitted by smaller towers to this central tower and would not pass through the satellite. All communications would be securely recorded but could only be accessed by the county court, mainly for consumer protection purposes, but only as the result of a court order for an on-going case. No advertising would be allowed, and each state would have its own process for allowing access to their satellite. When a consumer wants to purchase an item, the default method would be for the closest available product to be listed first and the consumer would control where they go from there. Use of all Apps should be put on hold by every state until the App can be fully decoded to fully understand the intentions of its producer. Don’t tell me machine-based algorithms can’t be decoded. We decoded the human genome we can decode anything. The hard part, the coding, has been done by the computer simply by giving the computer commands. But what commands were given, this is the only way to be safe. Only by fully decoding all Apps can we begin to understand the intentions of its producer. With each county, state and the federal government working to decode these products it won’t be long until plenty of Apps that are safe for use by the general public are available. Someone will develop a shortcut and someone else will develop a program that can fully decode any App, laying out every possible effect on the user whether intended or not. Where we are today with the use of computers and the internet and how we got here is not acceptable. For the majority of the public that communicates only with people in their county and state the only change would be, no more annoying advertisements, blinking in your peripheral vision, distracting you from being able to read the news. It would likely just be a matter of a very short time before most people would have some limited access to the rest of the world via the internet. As for embassies each embassy will have its own satellite unless there are a group of embassies located close enough to each other for them to be securely serviced by one satellite.  China has undue influence in our government and in the world, but China is losing face in the world. This is a huge problem for Xi because it appears that Xi has given Putin great confidence that he will continue as dictator of a pseudo democratic country, but Xi has problems within his own country and Putin is braking international laws holding power in conflict with Russia’s constitution. China has always been the worlds’ biggest problem, using secrecy and programming to cause corruption in every possible way. All people are genuinely very good hearted unless they are coerced into being corrupt by some outside force. For thousands of years that outside force has been China. Woodrow Wilson was speaking of China when he said: “Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.” He was wise enough not to name them at that time in history. And he was speaking of himself in the following quote, of course, but it can also be applied to President Donald Trump when he said: ""The man who is swimming against the stream knows the strength of it."" I believe Donald Trump when he says that he wants to restore democracy in the western hemisphere but the RNC and CIA only let him say it because they were confident that they will have their way in Central and South America and continue to rape, pillage and plunder those countries. We have this one last opportunity to return power to our elected officials and help our President, Donald Trump turn the tide against China so that he is no longer feeling the strength of the outgoing water but surfing above it, if you will, toward shore, coming home to hug the flag with the power of the people lifting him up. This can be done peacefully, and it must be done peacefully to succeed.  “If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may be even a worse fate, you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.”              – Winston Churchill –“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”  ― Franklin D. Roosevelt  “Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.” - George Washington - “Assessing how to be in the best position to overcome a future challenge”. IN GOD WE TRUSTLegislation that bans the production and sale of all semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons, magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and silencers is a must, with universal background checks for all sales of legal firearms are the minimum requirements for the legislation that we call upon President Donald Trump to vigorously back and for Mitch McConnel to bring before the Senate for a vote. This legislation must be permanent. Travel bans to the US due to the out of control gun violence on our streets should act as a powerfully motivating factor in choosing to vigorously back legislation that will get results. The NRA should not be allowed to influence what legislation you support.What we know about the El Paso and Dayton shooters’ gunsNation, 8/6/2019, by Laura SanthanamIn two mass shootings over the weekend, gunmen used what police described as semi-automatic, assault-style weapons — carrying enough ammunition to kill dozens in a matter of minutes. Both the guns and the high-volume magazines are controversial. The PBS NewsHour looked at what guns were used in the attacks, and how they might be regulated. In El Paso, police confirmed that the shooter used an AK-47 style rifle. The 21-year-old suspect wore ear protection but did not appear to wear any body armor or heat-resistant gloves. After police intervened, 22 people died and 24 more were injured. In Dayton, the shooter carried what authorities initially described as a .223-caliber high-capacity rifle, but is technically classified as a pistol. He also had 100-round drum magazines, according to the Dayton Police Department, allowing him to shoot up to 100 rounds before pausing to reload. With the high capacity, he killed nine people and injured 27 more in just 30 seconds before he was shot and killed by police. Fully loaded, his magazines would have carried 250 rounds of ammunition. Police released pictures of the weapon used in the attack, which showed the lower receiver, the base part around which the rest of the gun is constructed, was made by Anderson Manufacturing in Kentucky. It is unclear from the photos who made the stock and barrel. The weapon’s barrel is short, which makes it easier to conceal and use in close quarters. The shooter also had a tactical sight attached to his weapon — a Sightmark Ultra Shot Z-Series Reflex Sight — which is used for situations in which a shooter needs to sight something quickly. These guns, magazines and gear were legal in Texas and Ohio. But that wasn’t always the case. Originally passed by Congress in 1994, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban prohibited the production, sale, transfer, import or possession of semi-automatic assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. Under the ban, magazines were limited to a capacity of 10 rounds. The ban was set to expire in 10 years unless renewed by lawmakers. By 2004, control of Congress had switched to the Republicans, who allowed the ban to lapse that year. Since then, states have enacted their own restrictions. The type of guns used in El Paso and Dayton are banned in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont, according to the Giffords Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Minnesota and Virginia require potential buyers to pass a background check. The high-capacity magazines are prohibited in those same states, plus Colorado. In his remarks to the country, President Trump did not address specific gun control measures. Most Democratic presidential candidates have called for renewing the bans on semi-automatic weapons and high capacity magazines. Before this weekend’s two mass shootings, a majority of Americans said the government needs to better regulate guns. In a July 22 poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist, 57 percent of U.S. adults said they wanted the government to ban guns such as the AK-47 and AR-15. Another 41 percent of Americans said such a ban was a bad idea. The results showed deep partisan divides with 89 percent of Democrats backing a ban, joined only by 29 percent of Republicans. The National Rifle Association did not respond to the PBS NewsHour’s request for comment.McConnell suggests Senate could look at assault weapons ban, background checks by Lesley Clark, 8/8/2019Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, under severe pressure from Democrats and a growing number of Republicans, suggested Thursday that the Senate could look at a ban on assault weapons and that there’s Senate support for a move to expand background checks to nearly all gun sales. …Under pressure, McConnell raises possibility of Senate action on gun legislation By Colby Itkowitz, 8/8/2019Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he spoke to President Trump about the Senate working on legislation to tighten the nation’s gun laws after the August recess, as both men face heightened public pressure to do something about gun violence following last weekend’s two mass shootings. The Kentucky Republican, in his first interview since the shootings left 31 dead and dozens injured, specifically mentioned expanding background checks on gun purchases and “red-flag” laws, which would allow authorities to confiscate a firearm from someone deemed a risk to themselves or the public. “Those are two items that will be front and center as we see what we can come together on and pass,” McConnell said on Kentucky radio station 840 WHAS.At the same time, McConnell, who faces reelection next year, underscored the difficulty in reaching consensus on a divisive issue. Congress has not passed significant gun-control legislation since the 1990s. “It’s always a challenge in making federal legislation because we do have a lot of differences in our country over an issue like this,” he said. “I mean, how people in South Dakota, for example, feel about this issue would be dramatically different from how they feel about it in Boston.” McConnell, who is recuperating from a fractured shoulder, said he spoke to Trump on Thursday. Democrats have been urging McConnell to bring the Senate back to Washington immediately to vote on a measure that House passed in February to expand background checks on firearm sales. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent a letter Thursday to Trump asking him to use his constitutional powers to force the Senate back into session to vote on the bill. “Mr. President, we have an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to pass gun violence prevention background checks. However, Leader Mitch McConnell, describing himself as the ‘grim reaper,’ has been an obstacle to taking any action,” Pelosi wrote. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement that they’d spoken to Trump by phone on Thursday about gun policy. “We spoke to the President separately this afternoon and told him the best way forward to address gun violence in our country is for Leader McConnell to let the Senate take up and pass the House-passed universal background checks legislation and for the President to sign it into law,” they said. “The President gave us his assurances that he would review the bipartisan House-passed legislation and understood our interest in moving as quickly as possible to help save lives.” McConnell has been steadfast that he wouldn’t bring up anything unless it had Trump’s support and could garner a filibuster-proof 60 votes. Trump had threatened to veto the House-passed bill, but has signaled this week a willingness to expand background checks. McConnell described Trump as “anxious to get an outcome.” “And so am I,” McConnell said. “And I believe the Democrats will have to just admit that it’s better to get a result than just engage in this sort of endless point-scoring that has the tendency to occur after one of these awful, awful incidents.” Trump has spoken to National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre at least three times since the shootings and has been telling people he can get the NRA on board with something, according to administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. LaPierre said in a statement he wouldn’t discuss what he and Trump spoke about privately. “But I can confirm that the NRA opposes any legislation that unfairly infringes upon the rights of law-abiding citizens,” he said. “The inconvenient truth is this: the proposals being discussed by many would not have prevented the horrific tragedies in El Paso and Dayton. Worse, they would make millions of law abiding Americans less safe and less able to defend themselves and their loved ones.” LaPierre continued: “The NRA will work in good faith to pursue real solutions to the epidemic of violence in America. But many proposals are nothing more than ‘sound bite solutions’ — which fail to address the root of the problem, confront criminal behavior, or make our communities safer.” The Senate last attempted to pass new gun laws a few months after the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn. A bipartisan effort involving Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) on a background checks bill gave the legislation its best chance at passing in years, but it ultimately fell short by six votes. There is talk of resurrecting the Manchin-Toomey bill, which closes loopholes in background check laws and is similar to a measure passed in the House this year. But gun-control advocates prefer the House version because the senators included some concessions to gun rights advocates, such as providing exceptions for sales between family members. Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have said they are working on a red-flag bill that would offer federal grants and other incentives for states to develop laws implementing emergency risk protection orders. Those statutes would allow family members, law enforcement officials and others to petition a judge to bar firearms from someone they believe is an imminent threat to themselves or others. Seventeen states and the District already have such laws on the books, according to the Giffords gun-control group. “What we can’t do is fail to pass something, you know, by just locking up and failing to pass — that’s unacceptable,” McConnell said. “What I want to see here is an outcome, not a bunch of partisan back-and-forth, these shots across the bow.” Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey contributed to this story.  The only acceptable outcome if you wish to be re-elected is a yes vote on “Legislation that bans the production and sale of all semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons, magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and silencers and universal background checks for all sales of legal firearms.” We call upon President Donald Trump to vigorously back this legislation and that this legislation also be vigorously backed by Mitch McConnel he brings it before the Senate for a vote. This legislation must not be legislation that can lapse it must be permanent.That will prevent shooters from legally obtaining weapons that can kill dozens of people in mere minutes but what do we know about the shooters and why they committed mass murders. The truth is that no one commits mass murder without being coerced into through the use of mind control methods. Who is investigating the obvious? The obvious that there is certain to be a direct connection between these shooters and the FBI or CIA. The MK Ultra Program has taken on a life of its own and is being passed down through families now but still, whenever a crime of this kind occurs the FBI or the CIA are involved.Project MKULTRA  Mind Control WikiProject MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA, was the code name for a covert CIA mind-control and chemical interrogation research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. The program began in the early 1950s, continuing at least through the late 1960s, and it used United States citizens as its test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MK-ULTRA involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as other methodology, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function. Project MK-ULTRA was brought first to wide public attention in 1975 by the U.S. Congress, through investigations by the Church Committee, and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission. Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MK-ULTRA files destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order. Although the CIA insists that MK-ULTRA-type experiments have been abandoned, 14-year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducts disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MK-ULTRA was abandoned a ""cover story."" On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy said:The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an ""extensive testing and experimentation"" program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens ""at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign."" Several of these tests involved the administration of LSD to ""unwitting subjects in social situations."" At least one death, that of Dr. Frank Olson, resulted from these activities. The Agency itself acknowledged that these tests made little scientific sense. The agents doing the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers. To this day most specific information regarding Project MKULTRA remains highly classified.The project's intentionally oblique CIA cryptonym is made up of the digraph MK, meaning that the project was sponsored by the agency's Technical Services Division, followed by the arbitrary dictionary word ULTRA. Other related cryptonyms include MK-NAOMI and MK-DELTA. A precursor of the MK-ULTRA program began in 1945 when the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency was established and given direct responsibility for Operation Paperclip. Operation Paperclip was a program to recruit former Nazi spies, scientists and experts in torture and brainwashing, some of whom had just been identified and prosecuted as war criminals during the Nuremberg Trials. Several secret U.S. government projects grew out of Operation Paperclip. These projects included Project CHATTER (established 1947), and Project BLUEBIRD (established 1950), which was later renamed to Project ARTCHOKE in 1951. Their purpose was to study mind-control, interrogation, behavior modification and related topics. Headed by Dr. Sydney Gottlieb, the MK-ULTRA project was started on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953, largely in response to Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives. The CIA was also interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders with such techniques and would later invent several schemes to drug Fidel Castro. Experiments were often conducted without the subjects' knowledge or consent. In some cases, academic researchers being funded through grants from CIA front organizations were unaware that their work was being used for these purposes. In 1964, the project was renamed MK-SEARCH. The project attempted to produce a perfect truth drug for use in interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War, and generally to explore any other possibilities of mind control. An MK-ULTRA program tagged ""Operation Teapot"" involved the testing of pregnant women with radiation, among other things. Also under this program, U.S. Army soldiers were dosed with LSD to study the effects of panic. Another MK-ULTRA effort, Subproject 54, was the Navy's top secret ""Perfect Concussion"" program, which used sub aural frequency blasts to erase memory. During this program LSD's corollary effect on controlled and channeled mass panic was discovered. MK-ULTRA head Sidney Gottlieb was involved with both Operation Teapot and Subproject 54. The U.S. government officially denied involvement until 1995 when an official apology was issued to the pregnant women and to the affected U.S. Army soldiers. However, no apologies were offered to the affected U.S. Navy sailors or to a group of Oregon prison inmates, whose testicles were irradiated without their knowledge. Compensation for medical treatment resulting from these experiments has been disputed and remains tied up in arbitration more than 40 years after the fact. Since 1995, most of the associated files have been reclassified as Top Secret.Because most MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 by order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, it has been difficult, if not impossible, for investigators to gain a complete understanding of the more than 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MK Ultra and related CIA programs. The Agency poured millions of dollars into studies probing dozens of methods of influencing and controlling the mind. One 1955 MK-ULTRA document gives an indication of the size and range of the effort; this document refers to the study of an assortment of mind-altering substances described as follows: 1.      Substances which will promote illogical thinking and impulsiveness to the point where the recipient would be discredited in public. 2.      Substances which increase the efficiency of mentation and perception. 3.      Materials which will prevent or counteract the intoxicating effect of alcohol. 4.      Materials which will promote the intoxicating effect of alcohol. 5.      Materials which will produce the signs and symptoms of recognized diseases in a reversible way so that they may be used for malingering, etc. 6.      Materials which will render the induction of hypnosis easier or otherwise enhance its usefulness. 7.      Substances which will enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion during interrogation and so-called ""brain-washing"". 8.      Materials and physical methods which will produce amnesia for events preceding and during their use. 9.      Physical methods of producing shock and confusion over extended periods of time and capable of surreptitious use. 10.  Substances which produce physical disablement such as paralysis of the legs, acute anemia, etc. 11.  Substances which will produce ""pure"" euphoria with no subsequent let-down. 12.  Substances which alter personality structure in such a way that the tendency of the recipient to become dependent upon another person is enhanced. 13.  A material which will cause mental confusion of such a type that the individual under its influence will find it difficult to maintain a fabrication under questioning. 14.  Substances which will lower the ambition and general working efficiency of men when administered in undetectable amounts. 15.  Substances which promote weakness or distortion of the eyesight or hearing faculties, preferably without permanent effects. 16.  A knockout pill which can surreptitiously be administered in drinks, food, cigarettes, as an aerosol, etc., which will be safe to use, provide a maximum of amnesia, and be suitable for use by agent types on an ad hoc basis. 17.  A material which can be surreptitiously administered by the above routes and which in very small amounts will make it impossible for a man to perform any physical activity whatsoever. Historians have learned that creating a ""Manchurian Candidate"" (CIA: MK Ultra - managed assassins) subject through ""mind control"" techniques was undoubtedly a goal of MK-ULTRA and related CIA projects. A secretive arrangement granted a percentage of the CIA budget. The MK-ULTRA director was granted six percent of the CIA operating budget in 1953, without oversight or accounting. An estimated US$10m or more was spent. CIA documents suggest that ""chemical, biological and radiological"" means were investigated for the purpose of mind control as part of MK-ULTRA. Early efforts focused on LSD, which later came to dominate many of MK-ULTRA's programs. Experiments included administering LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions. LSD and other drugs were usually administered without the subject's knowledge and informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code that the U.S. agreed to follow after World War II. Efforts to ""recruit"" subjects were often illegal, even discounting the fact that drugs were being administered (though actual use of LSD, for example, was legal in the United States until October 6, 1966). In Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, and the brothels were equipped with one-way mirrors and the ""sessions"" were filmed for later viewing and study. Some subjects' participation was consensual, and in many of these cases, the subjects appeared to be singled out for even more extreme experiments. In one case, volunteers were given LSD for 77 consecutive days. LSD was eventually dismissed by MK-ULTRA's researchers as too unpredictable in its results. Although useful information was sometimes obtained through questioning subjects on LSD, not uncommonly the most marked effect would be the subject's absolute and utter certainty that they were able to withstand any form of interrogation attempt, even physical torture. Another technique investigated was connecting a barbiturate IV into one arm and an amphetamine IV into the other. The barbiturates were released into the subject first, and as soon as the subject began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released. The subject would begin babbling incoherently at this point, and it was sometimes possible to ask questions and get useful answers. Other experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MK-SEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine marijuana, alcohol, and sodium pentothal. Declassified MK-ULTRA documents indicate hypnosis was studied in the early 1950s. Experimental goals included: the creation of ""hypnotically induced anxieties,"" ""hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter,"" studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations, ""hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects,"" and studying ""relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis."" The experiments were exported to Canada when the CIA recruited Scottish physician Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the ""psychic driving"" concept, which the CIA found particularly interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKULTRA experiments there. In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His ""driving"" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions. His treatments resulted in victims' incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents. His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist Dr William Sargant at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who also experimented extensively and very damagingly on his patients without their consent and was similarly involved with the Intelligence Services. Dr. Cameron and Dr. Sargant are the only two identified Canadian experimenters, but the MKULTRA file makes reference to many other unnamed physicians who were recruited by the CIA. It was during this era that Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of the American and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron had also been a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946-47. In 1973, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MK-ULTRA files destroyed. Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MK-ULTRA all but impossible. In December 1974, The New York Times reported that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. That report prompted investigations by the U.S. Congress, in the form of the Church Committee, and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission that looked into domestic activities of the CIA, the FBI, and intelligence-related agencies of the military. In the summer of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential Rockefeller Commission report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject had died after administration of LSD. The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator Frank Church, concluded that prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects"". The committee noted that the ""experiments sponsored by these researchers ... call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments."" Following the recommendations of the Church Committee, President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited ""experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject"" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation. On the heels of the revelations about CIA experiments, similar stories surfaced regarding U.S. Army experiments. In 1975 the Secretary of the Army instructed the Army Inspector General to conduct an investigation. Among the findings of the Inspector General was the existence of a 1953 memorandum penned by then Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson. Documents show that the CIA participated in at least two of Department of Defense committees during 1952. These committee findings led to the issuance of the ""Wilson Memo,"" which mandated--in accord with Nuremberg Code protocols--that only volunteers be used for experimental operations conducted in the U.S. armed forces. In response to the Inspector General's investigation, the Wilson Memo was declassified in August 1975. With regard to drug testing within the Army, the Inspector General found that ""the evidence clearly reflected that every possible medical consideration was observed by the professional investigators at the Medical Research Laboratories."" However the Inspector General also found that the mandated requirements of Wilson's 1953 memorandum had been only partially adhered to; he concluded that the ""volunteers were not fully informed, as required, prior to their participation; and the methods of procuring their services, in many cases, appeared not to have been in accord with the intent of Department of the Army policies governing use of volunteers in research."" Other branches of the U.S. armed forces, the Air Force for example, were found not to have adhered to Wilson Memo stipulations regarding voluntary drug testing. In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984 on a CBC news show, The Fifth Estate. It was learned that not only had the CIA funded Dr. Cameron’s efforts, but perhaps even more shockingly, the Canadian government was fully aware of this, and had later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S. counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of court for $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. The U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances. The quote from the study: ... Working with the CIA, the Department of Defense gave hallucinogenic drugs to thousands of ""volunteer"" soldiers in the 1950's and 1960's. In addition to LSD, the Army also tested quinuclidine benzilate, a hallucinogen code-named BZ. (Note 37) Many of these tests were  conducted under the so-called MKULTRA program, established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing techniques. Between 1953 and 1964, the program consisted of 149 projects involving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects... Harold Blauer, a professional tennis player in New York City, died as a result of a secret Army experiment involving MDA. Frank Olson, a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in 1953 as part of a CIA experiment, and died under suspicious circumstances (initially labeled suicide) a week later following a severe psychotic episode. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson's recovery claimed to be asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson jumped through the window to fall ten stories to his death. Olson's son disputes this version of events and maintains that his father was murdered due to the belief that he was going to divulge his knowledge of the top-secret interrogation program code-named Project ARTICHOKE. Frank Olson's body was exhumed in 1994, and cranial injuries indicated Olson had been knocked unconscious before exiting the window. The CIA's own internal investigation, by contrast, claimed Gottlieb had conducted the experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olsen's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might well have been exacerbated by the LSD. The revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting illegal experiments. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson's family to publicly apologize. Previously, the CIA and the Army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of Army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an Army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine—known as the Feres doctrine, after a 1950 Supreme Court case, Feres v. United States—that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for any harms that were inflicted ""incident to service."" In 1987, the Supreme Court affirmed this defense in a 5–4 decision that dismissed Stanley's case (483US 669). The majority argued that ""a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters."" In dissent, Justice William Brennan argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of constitutional rights: The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects... . [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing a separate dissent, stated: No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.This is the only Supreme Court case to address the application of the Nuremberg Code to experimentation sponsored by the U.S. government. And while the suit was unsuccessful, dissenting opinions put the Army—and by association the entire government—on notice that use of individuals without their consent is unacceptable. The limited application of the Nuremberg Code in U.S. courts does not detract from the power of the principles it espouses, especially in light of stories of failure to follow these principles that appeared in the media and professional literature during the 1960s and 1970s and the policies eventually adopted in the mid-1970s. In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshall, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKULTRA and dismissed the case in 2007.Forty-four American colleges or universities, 15 research foundations or chemical or pharmaceutical companies and the like including Sandoz (currently Novartis) and Eli Lilly & Co., 12 hospitals or clinics (in addition to those associated with universities), and 3 prisons are known to have participated in MKULTRA.A considerable amount of credible circumstantial evidence suggests that Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, participated in CIA-sponsored MK-ULTRA experiments conducted at Harvard University from the fall of 1959 through the spring of 1962. During World War II, Henry Murray, the lead researcher in the Harvard experiments, served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was a forerunner of the CIA. Murray applied for a grant funded by the United States Navy, and his Harvard stress experiments strongly resembled those run by the OSS. Beginning at the age of sixteen, Kaczynski participated along with twenty-one other undergraduate students in the Harvard experiments, which have been described as ""disturbing"" and ""ethically indefensible."" Merry Prankster Ken Kesey, author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, volunteered for MK-ULTRA experiments while he was a student at Stanford University. Kesey's ingestion of LSD during these experiments led directly to his widespread promotion of the drug and the subsequent development of hippie culture. Candy Jones, American fashion model and radio host, claimed to have been a victim of mind control in the '60s. Infamous Irish mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger volunteered for testing while in prison. MK-ULTRA plays a part in many conspiracy theories given its nature and the destruction of most records. Lawrence Teeter, attorney for convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan, believed Sirhan was under the influence of hypnosis when he fired his weapon at Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. Teeter linked the CIA's MKULTRA program to mind control techniques that he claimed were used to control Sirhan. Teeter's assertions are generally dismissed due to lack of supporting evidence. Jonestown, the Guyana location of the Jim Jones cult and Peoples Temple mass suicide, was thought to be a test site for MKULTRA medical experiments after the official end of the program. Congressman Leo Ryan, a known critic of the CIA, was assassinated after he personally visited Jonestown to investigate various reported irregularities. Some claim that MK-ULTRA involved various crimes against children.  “But the waiting is the hardest part!”"

It is a constitutional right.But now gun-haters are trying to change the law to say that if anyone else is present when you hold a gun and they claim to be afraid, then you are a criminal and they will prosecute you for a misdemeanor of ""brandishing"" and a misdemeanor of ""assault by intimidation.""It is very clear:  They are claiming that merely if someone in the area claims to be afraid -- in their purely subjective claim from their point of view -- then you just holding a gun are committing a crime in Virginia.We are asking for help from second amendment organizations.   They will not be able to make a decision without reading the transcript.You can follow the status at:  http://www.JonMoseley.com/brandishing.htmlwhich will include updates and notes and also an itemized spreadsheet of how these donations are being used.  Money will be disbursed out of the escrow account at SunTrust Bank only  for authorized purposes to support this campaign to reform these ambiguous and vague laws to defend your Second Amendment rights.NOTE: Donations under $200 for sure are not publicly revealed, and possibly none of the donations will be publicly known.

God Bless! We MUST have a true American in the presidency! Please, the fate of our country lies in your hands. Any donation works, even one dollar helps! Thank you so much, and God Bless America!!!Here is an expert from an article to show why we need Trump!""In 2020, Donald Trump will be re-elected President of the United States.Why?Is it because Trump is a political savant? Well, no. Although the septuagenarian claims to be “like, really smart,” according to analysts at Factba.se, Trump speaks at the lowest grade level of the last fifteen presidents. Though, rather worryingly, Trump’s inability to speak in a coherent manner appears to resonate with millions of Americans, many of whom find his approach comforting and relatable.But Trump’s imminent reelection will be due to the fact that, at this time of writing, Democrats have very little to offer, very few candidates willing to get down and dirty with Trump—and, after all, politics is a dirty game.When it comes to possible presidential candidates, Democrats appear to be spoilt for choice: they are old, young, liberal, centrist, woke, super woke, etc. However, the large number of potential candidates doesn’t mean that any of them are actually capable of defeating the juggernaut known as Teflon Don.What about Beto O’Rourke? He’s cool, hip, relatable, charming, easy on the eye, young (ish) and a good talker. He has even played bass in a rock band. But Beto also happens to be a white male. And we all know how the left feel about white men. To make things worse, Beto comes from a place of privilege and has never known hardship. He didn’t have to fight his way to the top because of his gender or race. For these very reasons, perhaps, the forty-six-year-old Texan refuses to play rough, opting to only discuss the positive things he hopes to do if elected. Favoring platitudes over policy, Beto regularly spouts pseudo-profound drivel, which doesn’t mean anything, yet makes a certain subsection of voters feel all mushy inside. He is the human equivalent of a cute puppy video. But, in political dogfights, cute puppies are no match for rabid wolves. Political campaigns are not amiable dinner parties. Political campaigns are chaotic riots.Beto, a confrontation avoider, failed to call out Ted Cruz on his lies when the two competed in the 2018 United States Senate election in Texas. In the race for the 2016 presidency, Trump, one of the biggest liars ever known to man, continuously called Cruz out on his lies, even giving him the nickname Lyin’ Ted. Cruz is widely detested. John Boehner, the former House speaker, once referred to him as “Lucifer in the flesh.” If Beto can’t defeat Ted Cruz, one of the most unpopular politicians in the United States, he sure as hell can’t take on Trump. Beto is way too nice, and nice doesn’t win you the presidency. In politics, nice guys finish last.How about Bernie?During a recent town hall discussion in Kansas City, Missouri, potential independent 2020 White House contender Howard Schultz predicted that President Trump will win if the Democrats nominate Bernie, the self-described socialist. Mr Starbucks has a point. For millions of voters in the United States, the S word is a dirty word. The stigma associated with socialism has dogged not only Sanders’ campaign but almost the entire Obama presidency. Of all the programs introduced by the Obama administration, was there anything more contentious than Obamacare?Even though Obamacare has done a lot of good, its inextricable association with socialism has tarnished its reputation. For socialist-style policies to work, there needs to be a high level of trust among the populace. This is why the S word is not a dirty word in Scandinavia. The homogeneity of opinion in that part of the world makes it easier to implement socialism. However, in the United States, such homogeneity doesn’t exist. Trust is at an all-time low; suspicion is at an all-time high.According to a 2018 Axios poll, many Americans think people in the other party are ignorant, spiteful and evil and are destroying the country. 61% of Democrats see Republicans as “racist/bigoted/sexist”; 31% of Republicans view Democrats in the same light. In a low-trust society, people are constantly guessing others’ intentions and looking out for cheaters. People are unwilling to support programs that may benefit the enemy. When people don’t trust their governments and their fellow citizens, is it really so difficult to see why millions are reluctant to back socialist-style policies?This is why Bernie can’t beat Trump. This—and the fact that the left, spearheaded by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar—appears to be going through a phase of rejuvenation. Bernie is an old, white man. There doesn’t appear to be much room for white men in the Democrats’ current Millennial-driven, solar-powered bandwagon.Dismal DemsThe nouveau Dems aren’t the most likeable bunch. The new recruits are the type to get distracted by virtue signaling and identity politics—exactly the sort of thing that will get President Trump re-elected. People often vote for the most palatable candidate. They regularly vote against things instead of for them. They vote against philosophies, candidates and parties. As Gerard Alexander argues in a 2018 piece for The New York Times, “liberals may be more effective at causing resentment than in getting people to come their way.”In a frantic attempt to make themselves more palatable to a wider audience, Democratic candidates are desperately trying to out-left one another. Take Kamala Harris, for example. At a CNN town hall event in January of this year, Harris outlined her plan to raise taxes on corporations and wealthier Americans. But the senator also argued not just in favor of Medicare for all but also for the elimination of private health insurance. Even Bernie was lost for words. All of this money is going to me, not Trump. Harris also promised universal pre-K education and debt-free college. This sounds great—except that, as Trump showed with the wall, making big promises is one thing, but paying for them is another. According to a recent report by the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University, a Medicare-for-all plan would cost the government $32 trillion over the next decade. To a paraphrase a line from Top Gun, Harris and her fellow lefties are writing checks that the country can’t cash.When it comes to big promises, Harris is not an anomaly. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is offering an overly aggressive wealth tax. Meanwhile, Julian Castro, a presidential candidate from San Antonio, Texas, gleefully echoes the demands of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for a 75% marginal income tax rate.Can Anybody Stop the Trump Train?Trump seems to speak a language—albeit a rather erratic one—that resonates with the masses. Of course, nothing is set in stone. Trump’s volatility and fragile ego are repellent to many moderates. He could very well shoot himself in the foot. I mean that literally—Trump is not the brightest and you certainly wouldn’t trust him with a gun. This is Trump’s election to lose.What about Pete Buttigieg, the telegenic mayor of South Bend, Indiana? Pete what? Buttigieg, pronounced BOOTedgedge.Buttigieg has an impressive CV. He holds degrees from Harvard and Oxford; he has also worked as a consultant for McKinsey. Buttigieg speaks eight languages, including English, Maltese, Italian, French, Spanish, Dari, Arabic and Norwegian. In fact, he learned Norwegian to read the work of a specific author (talk about clearly defined goals). Elected mayor at the age of twenty-nine and re-elected at age thirty-three, Buttigieg also served in Afghanistan. All these experiences appear to have fashioned him into a surprising presidential candidate. At thirty-seven, Mayor Pete barely meets the constitutional age requirement for the job.If re-elected, Trump would be the oldest president in history, at seventy-four. If elected, Buttigieg would be the youngest. Humble, judicious, pragmatic, accomplished and “a near parody of normality,” as Andrew Sullivan has so brilliantly observed, Buttigieg, the son of two professors, is the antithesis of Trump. (Though, some may argue that Trump’s bad qualities are the very qualities that got him elected in the first place)Buttigieg is also America’s only openly gay 2020 presidential candidate. Is Buttigieg’s popularity a sign of tangible progress? Would Americans elect a gay president?Well, yes, it appears they would. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, first published in March, shows that Americans’ attitudes toward a gay presidential candidate have changed significantly over the last decade. 54% of Americans said they would be comfortable with a gay or lesbian running for president; an additional 14% said that they would be enthusiastic about a gay or lesbian candidate. The responses represent a huge contrast from a similar poll conducted in 2006, which found that more than 50 percent of Americans either had “reservations” about or were “very uncomfortable” with the thought of a gay person running the country.Nevertheless, when it comes to policy Buttigieg is thoroughly underwhelming. His delivery is rather bland. He lacks the charisma of a Biden or a Bernie. And the few good ideas he has are shared by other, more captivating candidates.Furthermore, even if Mayor Pete gets the nod from the Democrats, Trump still has an ace up his sleeve. It’s the economy, stupid.Voters (rightly or wrongly) tend to hold the sitting president accountable for either economic prosperity or a brutal recession. A strong economy is the most decisive factor driving support for the incumbent. Right now, the US economy is doing great. In fact, in March 2019, using economically based predictors, Politico published a piece stating that Trump appears to be “on track for a landslide” victory in 2020. At the time of writing, Trump’s economic rating is up eight points from April 2017, and five points from April 2018.What’s more, since 1916, only three elected incumbents have lost reelection: Presidents Hoover, Carter and H. W. Bush. Interestingly, each experienced negative real annual GDP growth during the year of their reelection. However, nine elected incumbents have won reelection in the last century. Unsurprisingly, not one of them experienced negative growth in their reelection year. If Trump can maintain this economic boom, he will be in a strong position to depict his eventual challenger as a risky bet, someone who could unsettle this economic harmony.The economy’s impact on reelection is as profound as it is irrefutable: the economic climate clearly shapes popular opinion of the president. As a result, there is every reason to believe that Trump’s approval rating has considerable room to grow between now and 2020. Democrats are right to be concerned. Presidents riding the wave of a strong economy simply do not lose. This has held true for more than a century. What makes you think that it won’t hold true for another few years?""Please help!!!!!"

There are 31 Congressional Democrats elected in 2018 who represent districts won by Donald Trump in 2016. These 31 Members of Congress (MoC) are the key to Impeachment. We are raising funds to support grass roots organizing in these districts to turn local public opinion in favor of Impeaching this criminal.

 

How will we achieve this goal?

*Financing the activities of proven community organizers in local communities: canvasing, community meetings, educational events to raise awareness of Trump's crimes, and organize voter engagement with their MoC to advocate for Impeachment.

*Frequent public opinion polling to 1) identify and duplicate the most effective strategies, and 2) demonstrate to MoC local support for Impeachment.

*Comprehensive multi-platform advertising to educate voters about the importance of impeaching this criminal president.This multi-state grass roots strategy is the surest road to getting Articles of Impeachment passed by the House of Representatives.

The longer explanation? I love being a math teacher; it is a profession I secretly wanted my entire life, but never had the nerve to purse precisely because of its economic limitations. Although I started my bachelor’s degree in 2001, I did not graduate until 2019. That’s right; it took me 18 years to earn my degree. After getting involved in fraternities in college, I began losing sight of my goals and ultimately dropped out of college. I joined and proudly served in the US Army for eight years and was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as part of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. Upon leaving the Army, I thought I was destined to spend the rest of my life in the US defense or intelligence communities as some type of analyst; and, I was right as that is exactly what happened…for a little while at least. Lucky for me, I was always blessed with a secret plan B: math. It turned out that writing Top Secret reports for the defense and intelligence industries wasn’t really my thing, as I had always dreamt of teaching math. After much soul searching [let’s be real, after my wife directed me], I resumed my degree. Now [in 2019], I have 3 children; a 6-year-old son, and a pair of identical 1-year old twin daughters. I earned my bachelors in math from George Mason University and became a high school learning disabilities geometry teacher; a challenge that I gladly and proudly accepted with Fairfax County Public Schools. I’ve now realized that my education journey is incomplete; I must earn a master’s degree in specialized education or math to continue growing as an educator. I’ve accepted that math is in my soul, and that teaching math is an even bigger passion. Nothing makes me happier in my professional job than the moment a student understands a math concept that s/he has been struggling with for some time. Yes, the public education system isn’t the best [this is a topic for future posts]; but the educators that comprise the FCPS system are some of the most passionate, educated, and determined teachers that I have ever known or worked with. In the 18+ years that it took me to complete my math degree I learned more than just math; I learned education, society, history, philosophy, and the desire to keep growing. So, I have created a medium where I can combine all my expertise – political, mathematical and educational, to produce somewhat controversial articles in various fields. Controversial because they are against the grain of main-stream media. As I have mentioned throughout this site, I don’t identify as either a Republican or Democrat; I simply state facts, whether you like them or not. As a result, all donations will go towards maintaining and improving the website, and to make sure it stays unbiased and free of prejudice. I plan to eventually launch and expand my full-scale website featuring a wide variety of services including, but not limited to math tutoring, test-preparation services, and certified translations of Persian/Farsi documents. Please make that happen.Thank you!"

Currently running water is an issue at the facility and improvements are currently being discussed.Since President Trump has made changes to asylum policies  stating that migrants trying to get to U.S. have to apply for asylum in the state that the first encounter when traveling out of their country of residence, there has been opposition to the new rule by mainly democrats. This link here briefly describes how 4.5 Billion dollars will be used to aid the conditions at the U.S. Mexico border; https://www.wola.org/analysis/the-4-billion-border-supplemental/ $4.6 Billion dollars are what were passed for border aid for the inhuman conditions found at the detention centers were overcrowding has become a significant issue. I think that this is a ridiculous way to spend tax dollars. It seems to me that we could all save ourselves Billions of tax dollars by spending this amount of money on humanitarian services like assisting in developing the Americas by providing better facilities for people to be able to seek the care that they need in order to be able to live productive lives in their home countries of residence. Spending money on alleviating these facilities by creating more detainment centers does not seem to be the answer for the migration crisis that we are currently seeing at the border. Let's help these people in other ways. Here's an article on what's going on since June 27, 2019. https://www.texastribune.org/2019/06/27/border-aid-migrants-passed-house-senate-bills-are-different/  It seems to me that we can better spend money in order to help our neighbors in the Americas like Guatemala be assisting them in developing these facilities."

PRESIDENT TRUMP SUPPORTER DISOWNED BY FAMILY,"Created July 14, 2019","Hello to everyone who is reading this, especially my fellow Democrats. My name is Isabella and I am now disowned by my family. We took a trip to Alberta, Canada a few weeks ago.Over dinner, I had casually mentioned that I support our President Trump with all of my heart and soul. I am a PATRIOT. We got into a fight and I went to bed angry at them. When I woke up, they had already left. They left me nothing, no food, no money, no clothing.I am now a homeless alien in Canada. I walked from the rockies all the way to Calgary and I am trying to get by day by day. All I have is access to the public library, and discovered that all my access to money are now gone. I could not contact my friends and other relatives. I have decided to ask for help from my fellow PATRIOTS and TRUMP SUPPORTERS.I need to be able to go back to my COUNTRY of UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I cannot live in such a world where DONALD TRUMP is not the head of state. I am strong and now highly motivated. I will now stand UNITED AS ONE with our brothers and sisters worldwide. We now fight for our freedom, liberty and our God given right to live in PEACE and LOVE. I fight with our brave patriot Military brothers and sisters and with our President and the rest of our brothers and sisters worldwide who are oppressed and have been silenced. We are taking back our Country. The time is now, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. If you want to stay in your fantasy bubble and pretend that children aren't being kidnapped, raped, tortured and murdered then may God have mercy on your soul. Until you actually do your research yourself to see that everything I've said is happening and factual then your opinion doesn't matter. Calling us conspiracy theorists only fuels our fire to expose more DARKNESS and shine a LIGHT. You prey on children because they can't defend themselves, that shows you are weak. It's been easy for you to win and get away with your crimes in the past because you don't play fair. It's quite clear that you fear President Trump and are desperate to get rid of him because he is exposing your crimes and evil. You no longer get to tell us how to feel, what to think, who to hate, what we have to accept or what is and isn't politically correct. We have had plenty of years of lies and deception. It's TRUTH time. The TRUTH is ugly. We can no longer be politically correct so if President Trump hurts your feelings because he speaks bluntly then oh well. It's time for the power to be given back to the people and those people who broke the law to be brought to Justice so we can begin healing and rebuilding. We welcome anyone with open arms who was asleep like us and we don't judge but until you have done the research yourself and stopped listening to the MSM and the other enemies before you call us conspiracy theorists, racists, call for violence against us or try to intimidate us, you are an enemy and are in our way and will be left behind. We are on a mission to MAGA!"

It is not a political goal. That is to say that the material we will distribute is not pushing people to vote Democrat or Republican, nor does this have anything to do with President Trump, Ben Shaprio etc.Why do this? The Reason is twofold. The first reason is that scripture (which is the inspired word of God) commands us to “love our neighbor as ourselves” (Deut. 6:4-6, Mark 12:29-30) so the project seeks to do just that, it is akin to when in WW2 some Germans would hide Jews from the Nazis,[1] those Germans were trying to save Jews from certain death and in so doing were loving their neighbors as themselves. But we want to go much farther than saving the unborn, we want to reach people with the true message of the glorious gospel[2] these two things are the purpose, for we cannot remain silent of the “American Holocaust”[3] lest we be regarded as accomplices,[4] nor can we remain silent about the gospel for it is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:18)How is it going to get done?The plan is to distribute 4,700 pro-life DVDs, and about 1,200 booklets. The name of the pro-life DVD is called “180” and the literature is called, “Life, in the womb” both are by Ray Comfort[5] and both includes the gospel. We will hang the materials at homes and apartments, and hand out the material at schools, and colleges. I will make sure to post videos and photos of myself and others doing this.What’s the cost? In order to do all of this, I need to raise $5,000 in order to purchase the DVDs and booklets. If there’s any remaining money will be spent on shipping, and if there is extra money given, it will go towards purchasing more material. The financial goal is to raise the funds by 2020.Conclusion:I thank you for reading this and showing interest in it. The one thing that I must ask of you is to refrain from supporting the work if you are not being faithful in giving to your local church. Thank you.  Footnotes:1.     A good book to read is “The Hiding Place” by Corrie Ten Boom2.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXOWyjB7d243.     https://answersingenesis.org/sanctity-of-life/the-results-of-evolution/4.     “Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless.

GLOBAL WARMING is real, it's really happening and it is the greatest threat to not only our survival but to every species on the planet as well.There have been multiple articles recently that have suggested what I've been thinking about too: making a Declaration of a State of Emergency so that our conversion to solar energy can begin at once, with every available resource brought to the fight, providing the scale of production required to succeed.The time for debate and speculation is over.  If our respective governments won't act immediately then it is our responsibility to take action on our own behalf, and our duty to mankind to make this effort succeed and spread around the globe!Issue: Under the current federal Administration, preparations to offset the causes of global warming with clean energy production have been sidelined. Our nation is not giving any thought to the future, and we are losing valuable time while the Earth gets warmer.  Technologies exist that could have a massive impact on reducing carbon dioxide output such as high output solar panels, fully electric vehicles, etc., however they are still not priced low enough for individuals to install them on their own. If we are to avoid massive disruptions in our global weather and temperatures, we must act immediately or pay far more to rectify our laziness in the future, assuming it's going to even be possible to turn around by then.Proposed Initiative: The California Renewable Energy State of Emergency DeclarationWhat this initiative would do is authorize the creation of a Solar Electric Renewable Energy Standards Corporation, whose sole purpose would be creation of a plan that will meet these program goals:A. TIMELINE  REQUIREMENTS : Due to the critical nature of this effort, the program is required to fulfill it's targets within eight (8) years.B. STATE OF EMERGENCY: Passage of this initiative shall acknowledge that a State of Emergency exists, and shall direct the Governor to provide the SERES Corp exemptions for environmental impact studies,, endangered or threatened species considerations, expedited permitting process for production facilities, installation staging locations and transportation infrastructure as required to fulfill the targets as required.Individual Installations shall be required for all residential and commercial locations that are continuously occupied,  and cannot be served via a local ,""solar zone' no exemptions shall be provided.C. Initially, solar Equipment shall be resourced from any supplier with the ability to provide the required volume of equipment. This initiative requires that multiple fully operational production facilities be constructed in California with 18 months with production capacity of enough panels to outfit or service 55,000 locations per month.D. EMPLOYMENT: California residents have first priority for all employment opportunities with SERES.  Wages shall be paid in accordance with California labor guidelines. 1. SOLAR PANELS: installing solar panels in 80% of California's residential and commercial locations, at little or no cost to the end users. This goal shall be achieved through two avenues:a. Solar Co-ops: Whenever possible, smaller commercial and residential areas (ex: apartment complexes) shall be provided with solar energy output via panels located within their local zone. The output must fully provide the required energy plus 20%.b. Individual Residential Installation: Individual Installations shall be scheduled for entire zones, with installation crews, scheduling agents, inspection teams and logistics working together 24 hours a day.2. LED LIGHTING: Simultaneously, provide no or low cost LED lighting to all local and state agencies , plus all residential and commercial buildings.3.  GAS ENGINE PHASE OUT: The current targets for electric vehicle sales shall be increased incrementally beginning January 2022, with 100% of all vehicles sold in California to be fully electric by 2030.FUNDING: To achieve the required timeline, this initiative shall be funded with a budget of $65 billion. Funding shall be provided by:1. General Fund Surplus2. Federal Matching Funds3. A $100/yr property tax add-on for duration.4. Bond IssueStage One: 1. Appoint Board of Directors: four Democrats, four Republicans, three Independent. All are required to have knowledge of major corporate operational demands.2. Hire Officers: CEO, CFO, HR, Etc. Begin preparations for massive corporate personnel hiring, public relations, etc.3. Job Creation: Initial estimates are 250,000 jobs created to fulfill this timeline.THIS WILL BE THE LARGEST NON MILITARY MOBILIZATION IN US HISTORY! CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE LEADER IN THIS COUNTRY. LETS SHOW THE WORLD WHAT WE CAN DO!"

Voted on and passed on the last day of legislative session (80th) with little to no publicity. The Democrat Assembly and Democrat Senate took provisions from a previous bill, SB256 and quietly attached them to SB151 which the Democrat governor signed along with many other last-minute bills.This bill effectively shut down their business, Worldwide Landlord LLC, with no warning. A business established 12 years ago dealing with many of the States largest property managers. A business owned jointly by a disabled Navy veteran Daryl Vogel and his wife Diana. Their reputation is impeccable and can be confirmed by Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas Courts and their constable’s offices. Not to mention property managers such as Oakwood Properties, Renters Warehouse, American Homes for Rent and Terra West. Our company’s role in the eviction process makes life easier and more cost effective for these property managers and owners. Because Worldwide Landlord (WWLL) works as agents of the property manager and/or owner, this law prohibits them from serving even the simple notices for overdue rent or lease violations therefore, forcing Worldwide Landlord out of business.Our CompanyWorldwide Landlord was initiated in 2008 here in Las Vegas. The owner Daryl Vogel, (Disabled Navy Veteran) and his wife, Diana Vogel. Over the years WWLL has grown from a mom and pop company to one who has 9 employees and over 100 property managers as clients. WWLL alone posts over 500 notices monthly, and processes over 50 evictions. As of July 1st, THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, WWLL has had to curtail services and begin the process of closing shop for good.Mr. Vogel, turning 70 and Mrs. Vogel, turning 60 had hoped to continue for 5 more years and then retire. They were planning to turn the business over to their loyal employees, who have been with them for many years.Bring a disabled vet, employment choices were limited. Daryl and Diana used their life-savings to start their business. They purchased an existing 15-year-old eviction service company and grew it from 2 employees to 9 today. What was a thriving company in June is now going to file bankruptcy THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. Not only have they lost their investment, their jobs and retirement, but also the jobs and security of their other 9 employees.Section 4 SB151 N.R.S. 40.280The language in section 4 is the only part of SB151 that affects Worldwide Landlord. The other provisions regarding:1. Time Frames2. Court Dates3. Fees4. Surrender of propertyare all agreeable and sensible.However, Section 4 reads;“Notices required by N.R.S. 40.251 to 40.260 inclusive, must be served by the Sheriff, a constable, a person who is a licensed as a process server pursuant to 648 of N.R.S., or the agent of an attorney licensed in this State.”Previously, notices could be served by a property manager, their agent or the property owner. Notices could also be served by the Sheriff, a constable, or a license process server as well.Clark County, alone has over 400,000 rental units and handled over 38,000 evictions in 2018. At a rate of 1 eviction per 8 notices served that would mean a total of 304,000 notices were served in 2018.In SummaryHow will the constables, Sheriff and selected process servers fulfill these time sensitive postings? That would mean doing the work of all the property managers, owners, and eviction companies combined. How many more government employees would need to be hired at taxpayers’ expense to accomplish this feat? It’s a needless expense for work that was previously handled quite efficiently in the private sector.Many innocent hard-working people like disabled vet Daryl and his wife Diana are suddenly without a job THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.A Note From Veteran Daryl;    I sent my first invites out for the gofundme page to the Nevada Assembly and Nevada State Senate and asked them to pass this on. The purpose of the gofundme page is to pay off the outstanding debt of my now bankrupt  business. The 30 days of notice time the Nevada Legislative gave us is not enough to comply to the new laws. Because of my limited work abilities I am forced to retire on just my social security without the security of income from my wife and I small business . The business investment/retirement is lost for good. Until my wife can secure a working job we will continue into debt. Diana is still a work-capable and is ready for the next decade, and in the case I don't survive through this period she will become the only wage earner. "

I know the surprising story of Prostitution and Drugs, the good people who were used and broken by them and when Joe Biden could have stopped it all, he continued to allow it happen in his own house and let the cycle of destruction continue to people who came in and out of his circle. In Early 2019 I contacted authorities, specifically the Drug Task force and told them about what I had witnessed and been a part of within this circle.  The information I gave them was 100% factual because I was there when most of it happened. To this date the police have not investigated Hunter or Joe Biden for the facts I brought to themMuch of the talk surrounding the Mueller Report, the collision and obstruction angle is all based on the ideology that no one is above the law. The left that I am a part of screams that Trump is guilty and no one is above the law. Yet here in Delaware Joe and Hunter Biden get to whatever they want, to whomever they want and or turn a blind eye to it.I have friends who's lives are destroyed because of the influence the Biden MEN have Since the Authorities seem unwilling to do ANYTHING about this, the only thing I can do is create my own presentation of the facts so that America knows the TRUTH about how the Biden men have destroyed people's lives directly and allowed this to continue because of their EGO and their selfishnessThis short film will detail the people and places involved in a short film about drugs/ prostitution/ and destruction of good people so that the powerful  could consume.It's surprising, depressing and 100% realPlease help me raise this money to deliver this short film. Whether you are a supporter of another Democratic Canidate or a Trump supporter... This film will open your eyes about the Biden men."

Ever since it started, I've been wanting to go outside to interview regular low-class women, and men (the vast majority) about what their opinions are about the ridiculous first world-problems progressives seem to fight. I might sound biased, and I admit: I can't imagine people thinking other than this when they see the propaganda... but it doesn't mean that's how I would want it to turn out. It would blow my mind if they somehow agreed and were thankful, and I'd go with it. That'd be even more interesting to me, and a chance to change my mind and learn.Some examples of the type of things I would like to show them are YouTube and mainstream media videos where they complain of things like ""Fashion designers don't make clothes in sized that fit me,"" how being harassed on Twitter is equal to violence (including Anita Sarkeesian's hearing at the UN,) how offensive it is to be called ""sweetie"" and the standards of rape they've set for society lately.It would be super interesting to hear they opinion on those issues, what they would consider to be problematic or not, and what they own problems in their daily life look like in comparison. Also, what would they ask the people that claim to fight for them to do to help them instead. I think it is very important for them to hear what actual Mexicans and potential future ""refugees""think about them protesting issues like the wall, Donald Trump's bigotry, and what their perception of why so many people have been forming caravans to migrate to the US lately. I really, really don't think any of the democrats bothered to ask any actual Mexicans (the ones living in Mexico) want at all, and that is hypocritical. Your political affairs are none of our business until you start using us as an excuse to claim political power by misrepresenting our positions.I am not anywhere wealthy myself, so the production budget is quite humble. I'm pretty much basically asking for a 100 dollars to give each one of ten interviewees (because it would be so unfair to expose them to first world women complaining about being oppressed, and not remunerate them as if that wouldn't hurt their feelings and pride by asking them to expose their own personal vulnerabilities to the camera, as well as what real-world women have to deal with everyday.)The other 500 dollars I'm asking for is just for subtitling of the original videos I will be showing to these women, although dubbing it would be better a they talk really fast. I'll be recording it with regular cell-phones, nothing fancy. Me interviewing, two friends working the shots, in their homes and/or the streets. I think that it would be great to interview some at 6 a.m. when they're already working making tortillas. They have impressive working discipline. And thanking God for the opportunity to do so. Really, just impressive.Then in post production, just the editing, audio mixing and subtitling of what they say for an English-speaking language to understand. Dubbing it for English may be too expensive as we don't have many voice-talents for it around here, so... Could easily get it dubbed over the internet if we get extra money over the original request.So this is my idea. I think it would be beneficial for first-world feminists to be exposed to the life experiences and problems of regular Mexican women, to gain some perspective out of it. And it would be incredibly helpful for those women as well to receive a hundred dollars in return (and as a token of appreciation for their emotional labor.) I have been watching over the internet how your country has been getting more and more polarized and it hurts me as well, as I used to look up to you people since forever, and really wish to help.Now, I have two months off of work to execute this project, I'll go back in September, so the time is just barely enough. I will give this fundraiser ten days , and see if we were able to reach the goal by the 15th, so I can get working on it and hopefully be able to post the result to YouTube and in every other platforms we can share it on, by September 1st. So I hope you can support me with this project, and I hope we can make it.This is the very first time I have ever done something like this GoFundMe thing ever, and I'm not particularly good at marketing. Don't really have American contacts to share this with, nor know that many sites to promote this other than Reddit... so I would really, really, really appreciate it if you could help me by sharing this with your friends or anywhere and everywhere you can if you think it's a good idea. Pretty, pretty please. I will do my best as well, but I am just a Mexican guy looking from the outside, so I don't feel quite confident about me doing such good promoting on my own heh heh So thank you very, very much for reading so far, and have a super fun happy day... under sunshine with warm beautiful glares and rainbows everywhere ha ha Just kidding :) Thanks! Bye!PS, recommendations for topics, videos to show, or any other ideas you may want me to incorporate in this, are totally welcome!"

Reed. I'm running for the District 10 position within the Washington State Legislature.  Why do I need your money? Simple: because I'm just a self employed local man that's been running a small business for nearly two decades. While this has provided me with the ability to provide for my family, and the freedom to live a good life.. I don't make the kind of ""legacy money"" that controls politics today. To me, that's a good thing. I'm a regular guy, that has worked for, with, and employed the other regular folks in Island, Skagit, and Snohomish Counties. And over the years, I've gained real world, relevant leadership experience. About me:Born a Democrat. Started a business at 22, swung to the Republican side of things. I've experienced the pitfalls of the medical system; both the old and new ways of care (or lack thereof). I have been married twice, and we raised a lovely daughter that just graduated from CHS. My wife Jessica and I are raising our 13 year old son in Oak Harbor. We own a lawn company that employees the whole family, and a few other people as well. We conduct business throughout all three counties. I have some college under my belt, and my wife has two degrees in environmental sciences and biology. She's currently enrolled at Western. I'm looking to further my physics, philosophy, and political science lessons at the University of Washington next year. (I'm super excited about their new online and adult education program!) I have years of business management, logistical, and economic experience, all leaned through real-world, on-the-job training.I am far from perfect. But I'm okay with that, and I hope you would be as well. Some Democrats don't like the fact that I'm a gun rights advocate. And some Republicans don't like that I'm not bothered, by some of the (more moderate) policy  ideas put forth by liberal gun control lobbyists (""slippery slope""). And both sides have valid arguments regarding abortion issues. (That being said, you won't convince me that women's rights aren't getting stomped daily, and that needs to change now.) But before we decide to hate each other over these differences, maybe we should actually sit down and discuss them? Without being ashamed of our ideas. And without shaming others for disagreeing. I don't think I'm off base here either: I've spent the last ten years walking, and taking with the constituents every day: they all just want the same thing.. happiness. Yes, this an actual fact. We calculated the distance, and I've walked from here to Florida and back, TWICE. I've been hit by trucks, crashed motorcycles, fallen off of water towers. I was born with degenerative disc disease. I've had three corrective surgeries.. and need more in the future. I've got arthritis, and joint damage. I've been denied care, had to decline care, and had the best care available at times. I overcame all of this.  I even became addicted to pain killers as a result, and conquered this too. All of it took help from my community and family, which are really one and the same, in my eyes. We even developed a system, backed by doctors and nurses, to help others beat opiates.. and we have plans to roll it out statewide. It also offers professional care-based solutions for extremely low cost. With no increase is taxes. You see, when actual citizens get elected, we bring our entire community to Olympia with us. And their ideas and solutions. We give out or personal contact info to voters. We work full time, year round. Because in my humble opinion, the ""part time salary"" is plenty to keep me going full time.. because a State Rep is the most important person in government: the direct link to affect change, through your neighbor.. Your friend. Your family.Thank you for reading this. The fact that you made it to the end, means you are ready for a change in the way we govern ourselves. And thank you for giving me your time.. Your most valuable asset. That alone is so very humbling to me. Almost as humbling as a $5 donation;)"

Let me start by saying I hold Conservative values.  However, that will never prevent me from 'calling it like it is'. This means I will never shy away from holding Republicans, Independents, and/or Democrats accountable. If there is something the public needs to know, and if politicians need to be held accountable, their party designation will not prevent me from doing that. Conservative voices and News sources are being silenced and censored on a daily basis. I believe one of the most important lines ever said was ""facts over feelings"". This term will be the foundation of my reporting. WHAT: My mission is very simple. I want to start a Media Company that relies on the 5 pillars of Journalism in order to disseminate information. 1: True and Accurate reporting - strive to provide balanced and verified information; provide all facts pertaining to the topic so the reader/watcher can form their own opinion. Never leave verified facts out of a story for the purpose of swaying opinion.2: Independence - I will always present the facts with an Independent voice, free from outside influence (donators are encouraged to participate/give their thoughts but I will never compromise my values or reporting for anyone) My job is to provide the information so you can make up your mind. I will NEVER attempt to make it up for you. 3: Fairness and Impartiality - The articles/videos I present shall always maintain contextual accuracy; there will NEVER be a time when information is deceptively edited or presented4: Accountability - hold myself accountable to maintain complete professionalism and responsibility in my work as an independent journalist.5: Humanity - strive to always hold myself to a higher standard of ethical and appropriate behavior. I know my words will have an impact, and that should never be used for personal gain or to harm others. WHEN: ASAPWHERE: For the initial launch of our Media Group, I will rely heavily on YouTube to disseminate most of my videos. I will also rely on Social Media to spread the word and publish articles. However, within a short period of time, I will have a website up and running which will serve as the 'home base' for all of the information. HOW: My desire to deliver accurate and fair information is only matched by my dedication towards the goal. This will not be a hobby. This will not be a part-time job. I am prepared to work long hours and dedicate all my time towards these goals while maintaining the 5 pillars discussed above. Not only for myself but more importantly for the people who trust me to deliver their News. They deserve my absolute dedication. WHO: Me, myself, and you. WHY: It is becoming increasingly difficult to decipher between fair and accurate News sources. While each individual reader should do their own personal research into topics presented, the reader should not have to worry about being misled. My passion for honest Journalism and my desire to do good in the world are just two reasons why I must go after my dream...and I shall do just that. ** each person who donates will be provided with receipts of equipment in order to see exactly where their donation is going (Camera, Tripod, Microphone, Lighting, Editing software, etc.) "

If, like me, you are tired of Congress's refusal to help President Trump solve the crisis at our southern border, then please help us provide a critical solution! We , the people, will move the migrant  children and parents crowded in Texas border towns to Blue State sanctuary cities, but will only do so in a humane way, and with their dignity and safety very much in mind.In spite of the fact the President has recently reached an agreement with the Mexicans to curtail the mass migration through their country, it would be naive to believe that 6,000 Mexican officers will be able to stop all of the tens of thousands of Central American migrants from reaching America.The deluge of illegal immigration flooding our southern border must be stopped, but then we must also be realistic about the migrants who are here waiting legal disposition.We Americans are a compassionate people. The critical needs of the thousands amassing in Texas must be met. Their needs will be best provided in Blue Sate sanctuary cities.Besides, a permanent solution will only happen when the Democrat-led House of Representatives fully recognize the problem. Transporting the migrants to the legislators’ home districts will force them to deal with reality.This is a Certified Charity campaign. Humane Way was set up as an Anchor Vision Partners project. Anchor Vision is a long-standing and well-respected 501(c)(3) nonprofit that strictly abides by all laws and regulations. All donations will be received by and paid out by Anchor Vision to verified transportation contractors, social workers and support staff. No proceeds will be paid to myself or any of the organizers of this fundraising campaign.THE NEEDThe U.S. - Mexico border has never seen arrivals of children and their parents like it is experiencing now. Two-thirds of the current apprehensions are young children and their families. U.S. border authorities are predicting that one-million undocumented migrants will be stopped at the southern border by the end of 2019. This has doubled that of last year. The majority of these children, their parents, and other asylum seekers aren't trying to avoid capture. After walking thousands of miles, either they wait with timid expectation until they are permitted to present themselves to CBP officials or they cross to where they can touch U.S. soil and wait in fear for Border Patrol to apprehend them. By international law and U.S. law, anyone who steps a foot onto U.S. soil and makes a legitimate claim must be given a credible fear interview to determine eligibility for an asylum hearing before an immigration judge.There are now 850,000 cases pending in the immigration court system. It will take as much as 9 years for the current roster of immigration judges to hear all these cases. In the meanwhile, it costs the government $295 per day per family to detain the migrants. Instead, CBP is simply dropping them off at local churches and help centers. The influx has gotten so bad at places like El Paso, Texas, that the central processing center was 395 percent over capacity, forcing officials to process people in deadly heat beneath a street overpass. Authorities have resorted to holding migrants in pens with concerting wire. ""The federal government is saying, 'This is not our responsibility'. This is going to be a public health disaster. There are small children. These are babies, and we cannot have people just out in the heat."" Connie Phillips, president and CEO of Lutheran Social Services.Border relief organizations are desperately trying to relieve the humanitarian crisis. They are struggling to feed and house the migrants and warning that the public health crisis is quickly escalating, especially with sick infants and children among the migrant families who need medical attention. Americans are also suffering. Crime has soared in the border towns. Residents are living in fear from the explosive effects of the mass overcrowding.And in spite of the recent 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision which allows CBP to send some migrants back to Mexico pending their asylum hearings thousands of children and their parents continue to amass in American border towns. THE SOLUTIONWith your help, Humane Way will provide immediate relief. The children and their parents will be treated with care and dignity. They will be transported to a Blue State sanctuary city where they will be provided with support and services.Preparations will be prearranged with migrant help centers in these sanctuary cities. Humane Way will make sure that social workers will be there to welcome the children and their parents and obtain the services they need.Humane Way will go to where the children and their parents are currently crowded. Staff will greet them at the churches and holding centers. Spanish speaking agents will explain that free bus transportation will be provided to those who wish to go to sanctuary cities where people are waiting to help them with food, housing, education for the children, and to find jobs. Medical attention will be given to those with immediate needs. Those families who want to go will board buses. Food and water will be handed out. Their safety and comfort will be assured. All drivers will have commercial driver licenses. Buses will meet all safety regulations and be fully insured. The children and their parents will then be comfortably transported to their new homes. Humane Way will not limit this welcome wagon service to just overcrowded local border facilities, but will also reach out to migrant holding centers in the interior of America where CBP has also dropped off tens of thousands of helpless people.Humane Way will provide immediate relief to children and parents throughout the southwest. The families will be then be taken to sanctuary cities in the Blue States of California, New Mexico and Nevada. GOALS AND COSTS Humane Way will make sure that every dollar counts.Our goal is to raise $3.6 million. The money raised will be spent on transporting children and parents, and provide for their welfare and comfort while traveling. For this we have budgeted $60 per migrant. Reaching our goal will allow us to transport 10,000 children and parents per month for six months.CHARITABLE SUPPORT & FISCAL RESPONSIBILITYWe are Anchor Vision Partners, Inc. I'm Hope Elliot the CEO. Humane Way is a Anchor Vision Partners project. Anchor Vision (anchorvisionpartners.org), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, will provide the Humane Way project with valuable expertise, oversight and fiscal governance. With its help you may be assured that the mission will be accomplished with full fiscal responsibility.PLEASE HELP MOVE THE CHILDREN TO SANCTUARYPlease donate what you can to help transport the children and their parents.

Recently I was accused of being less than loyal to my race because I supported offering the option of studying the Bible in our public schools as suggested by President Trump.  The question was asked whether I was a brother because of my position.  Clearly our level of awareness is necessary as we head into the 2020 campaign for President and other races. Yes I am a brother and a very concern one at that. Martin Luther King was a brother, so was A.Phillip Randolph, Booker T. Washington, Fredrick Douglas, and others. Mary McCloud Bethune was a sister. What did they have in common. They were all Republicans. I will return to this in a moment. When I taught American government at Florida State University at the end of each term the dean would call me to his office and basely plead that I refrain from teaching from a text book titled, ""The Irony of Democracy"" by Thomas Dye. The book main premise was this government is not what we have been taught since grade school, that is, the government of the people by the people. Dye asserted that is a lie, it is the government of the few, the Haves, which he said the government of one half of one percent. When it comes to the two major parties, Democrats and Republians he called them ""Twittley Dee and Twittley Dom"" fraternal twins. I submit that it is political suicide to be a one party people in a two party system. History should have taught Black people enslaved here in America this vital point. At one point in our history 99.9% of all registered black folks in America were Republicans. The party of Lincoln, the man who freed us. (what a joke). Why you would have been lynched by your own brothers and sister's if it was discovered that you as an African American supported a Democrat (former slave holders and creators of the KKK). We as a people were extremely loyal to the Republican party even during the election of Rudolph B. Hayes, Republican candidate for president who cut a deal with the Democrats which in effect returned the South back to the Sons and Daughters of the Confederate and the removal of Black Republican state Senators and legislators who had introduced and passed legislation favorable to the freedman (former salves) i.e. public schools. We were a one party people who had been manipulated by the Twins (""Twittley Dee and Twittley Dom"". Even after all of this we remained loyal to the Republican Party until Franklin D. Roosevelt second term. We only became Democrats then because we were promised and received an extra bag of flour or meal etc with each child that was given birth much like the former Master gave the female slave on the plantation. Our former slave masters have mastered the art of pacifying and manipulating us as a people. Now here we are in the 21st century still being manipulated by the ""Twins"" because we remain a one party people in a to party system. Who do you think authored the three strike rule that has significantly increased the disproportionate number of Black men being incarcerated in or criminal not so justice system. You guessed it your beloved Democrats. I recall in a 1958 interview, King said “I don’t think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses…And I’m not inextricably bound to either party.” This is the position that I think we should take. Now whether a Democrat or Republican take a position that is in line with my stand whether it is theological, political, social or economic that is the candidate that will receive my support. I will Not be taken for granted nor ignored. Listen my brothers and sisters beware not so much about Donald Trump but these poverty pimps that the Democrats will continue to release on you, telling you the boogie man is going to get you if you don't support our candidate, which they do for their own personal gain. There is much more that I could write here but I will end this session with something that Malcolm X once said. He said any people that supports a party with unwavering loyalty and that party.does not support them with equal enthusiasm, not only are they a political chump they are also a Traitor to their race. I need help as mentioned above to reeducate African Americans particularly about our political participation."

While it should be up to the US Government to support their citizens in their time of need, the Democrats have seen it fit to block any legislative effort to help our farmers. Currently, all efforts by President Trump to support our farmers are being blocked by congress and Democrat blocks.Therefore, We the People will support our Farmers.A lot of operations “can’t even get two years of bad luck without losing the farm.” As such, lending institutions have begun to deny operating loans or require more collateral than they have in recent years while prices show no sign of improving, many farmers are finding their luck is running out.For dairy farmers, facing a fourth straight year of prices below the cost of production, bad luck has become an apocalypse. Pennsylvania farmer Brenda describes the uncertainty and stress on her dairy farm as a “war situation.” She compares it to being asked to “walk through a minefield with a baby on your hip.” A gallon of milk costs a farmer approximately $1.90 to produce, but in the last year, farmers have been receiving as little as $1.35 per gallon. With prices so low, Brenda wonders how to pay for seed corn, feed, potential visits from the veterinarian, and health care for her ill husband. Ultimately, she wonders, “What is tomorrow going to hold for us? Can we go through another season?”By donating to help the Farmers Fund of America, you will directly help our struggling farmers to ensure that they will keep their farms, and help their families.

Election Day, 2016.

Do you remember where you were when Donald Trump became President?

I was covered in sweat and surrounded by volunteers at a Hillary Clinton MegaPhone Bank in Culver City. Just like everyone else, I thought we were welcoming in the first female President of the United States of America. I, like everyone else, was in for a rude awakening. In the video below, I introduced Senator Barbara Boxer, and we were both excited about ushering in a new era.

The last two and a half years of a Donald Trump Presidency has tested the limits of our democracy. 2020 Elections are right around the corner and I know none of us want to have that same crushing feeling on election night. I have a plan.

We will create entertaining political content to educate voters and engage volunteers. With more than 20 Democratic Candidates and a Reality TV President, the most substantive messages often get lost in the news cycle. By creating funny and meaningful videos with our favorite comedians, improvisors, and celebrities, we can break through the chatter and have our voices heard. This was a model that worked in the 2018 Midterm elections, its time to scale it out for 2020!

Who am I:

My name is Marquis Olison.

In 2008, I was an Obama Super Volunteer who held fundraisers at the Comedy Store and Akasha Restaurant. I helped build one of the World's Largest Political Phone Banks, and led Camp Obama Trainings in Southern California.

In 2010, I was the California Volunteer Coordinator for the DNC. That year, California was the only State that didn't lose a single seat to Republicans.



In 2012, I was on the California Border State Team which sent thousands of volunteers to Nevada to help President Obama secure a second term.

In 2016, I was the Southern California Field Director for Common Sense Kids Action. We built a parent army to pass pro-kids and family legislation in California. (I also moonlighted helping out at the Hillary Campaign)

I've worked and volunteered with several organizations including Swingleft, Airbnb, and Nextdoor.com to teach and train people how to tell their story, how to engage with their friends and neighbors.

Before I was a community organizer, I was a comedian! I've appeared on MTV, BET, and Jimmy Kimmel Live. I was an associate producer with the Jerry Springer Show and have produced and consulted on countless comedy shorts.Now that you know who I am How will the money be used:1. Create a SuperPac for Comedy to Save Democracy2. Hire a treasurer, Digital Director,  Writers, Directors, Editors, and Actors3. An Office/Studio Space to shoot videos until November 20204. Build a  Website and Social Media Presence.5. Create grassroots organizer trainings to teach people how they can get involved in their own towns.6. Launch a Liberal Comedians tour to entertain, educated, and register voters ahead of the primaries.7. Create Ads for the eventual Democratic Primary Winner8. Win!10 years ago, Barack Obama became a Social Media Sensation with things like ""Obama Girl"" and Will-I-Am ""Yes We Can.""  Lets help Democrats take back the Senate, Governor's Mansions, and The White House!

Today, Florida is nowhere to be found in those rankings due to lack of support from State Legislative Leadership. The blatant attacks on the industry in recent years were personal and unfortunately have had devastating effects on the industry. In the last 4 years, Florida has lost over $1 BILLION in film and television projects that wanted to film in Florida. Without a funded program to compete with the likes of Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, New York and California, those projects, along with their 87,000+ cast and crew jobs, went elsewhere. More than 30 states have programs to entice film, television and digital media companies and projects to their states. Unfortunately Florida is the only state in the Southeast without a program. It’s time for that to change!

With the help of industry professionals and supporters, the Floridians For Film and Tech Production PAC has the opportunity to effect change when it comes to advocating for the industry. I am writing today to ask you to join me in supporting the 2019 Floridians For Film and Tech Production PAC campaign.The Floridians For Film and Tech Production PAC is committed to working with agenda drivers and decision makers in the Florida Legislature.

It’s entertainment with an unabashedly conservative, populist point-of-view.  Can that be true?  Hmmm.We all know the Entertainment Industry only produces left-leaning programming.  Conservative-oriented entertainment is virtually nonexistent.  That’s astonishing, given the gazillion cable channels these days, and the need to fill them with content.  That’s why there are so many awful TV shows that appeal to viewers with the IQ’s of cornflakes.  It’s difficult to stock so many time slots with quality material.But shouldn’t that mean that there is a huge need for any kind of good entertainment, even if it leans right politically?Apparently not.We’re told that conservatives aren’t talented or funny or even capable of entertaining.  That’s the reason they’re essentially invisible in showbiz.  (Of course, the same things were said in the past about groups like (fill-in-the-blank) before they became fed up with the blatant exclusion and demanded a place at the table.Could it be that conservative projects are blacklisted in Hollywood? Maybe rightlisted would be the appropriate term.  How is that possible?!  We all know how open-minded Hollywood is (that’s what they tell us, of course).Surely, in the multi-billion-dollar, culturally-ubiquitous Entertainment Industry - which wields untrammeled power to convey ideas and attitudes - there is room for a diversity of ideas.Nope.Let’s change that.Let me present Ringg Leeder.Ringg Leeder is a web comedy series that satirizes current events, culture, politics, TV, movies, print media, Hollywood, and Madison Avenue.  It unflinchingly takes on the current leftist media zeitgeist that drives half of America crazy – that half of America that the Entertainment Industry chooses to either ignore or vilify.Ringg Leeder is kind of like Saturday Night Live, but without the liberal slant.  Ringg Leeder is mostly skit comedy, performed by live actors.  The shows feature skits, “news” telecasts, videos, animation, mockumentaries, parodies, and viewer participation.  Each show will be based on what’s currently happening in America and around the world.  There will seven one-hour shows, shot in Orange County, California, to be shown starting late 2019.WHAT IS RINGG LEEDER ABOUT?The topics we'll satirize will include: repressive political correctness; political censorship by left-leaning internet companies; preachy celebrities; PC mob violence;  the absurdly partisan “news” business; the farcical Democrat-led Russian Collusion coup d’etat  scheme; Hollywood exclusion of all material that doesn’t reflect a “progressive” worldview; the slandering of people because they are not the “correct” race, gender, religion, or political affiliation; Big Media content which demeans religion; Big Media’s targeting of kids with graphic violence  (and Hollywood’s success at squelching any discussion of its own violent content in the ongoing gun debate); affirmative action policies that ignore huge numbers of the economically disadvantaged; environmentalist extremism; unfunny late-night talk show hosts; the Democratic Party’s hostility towards European-American men; leftist immigration policies that aim to keep disadvantaged citizens disadvantaged forever; Schiffism – that philosophical child of McCarthyism  (but even more malevolent than its Cold War predecessor); Republican Party faint-heartedness and fear of Big Media; the War Against Christmas: campus suppression of dissent; incomprehensible Progressive socio-babble; revisionist history; the sly placement of sexually-charged commercials in programs viewed by children; meaningless borders; Big Media’s Anti-Trump Derangement Syndrome; and generally every aspect of our roiling culture that increasingly seeks to reduce our vibrant, heterogeneous society into a dull homogenized idiocracy in which leftist hall-monitors promote skin-deep diversity but demand obedience to authoritarian rules of behavior. WHY BACK RINGG LEEDER?For generations, major parts of the prevailing narratives have been shaped by Big Media/Hollywood.  Its vast resources have enabled it to control the infrastructure of mass entertainment – that is, the physical means of financing and producing entertainment and disseminating it.  But as Big Media has grown to gargantuan proportions, its insularity from the rest of the country has increased - and so has its affinity for leftist politics.   Now ossified in its attitudes, Big Media/Hollywood’s distaste for dissenting creative voices and opinions has resulted in the exclusion of those voices.   It’s de facto censorship. Now that the internet has democratized the distribution of content – and, uh oh! - ushered in the potential for the creation of material not controlled by monolithic studios, many in Big Media and its supporters are reacting like engorged oligarchs denied an extra helping of pudding. If you’ve been paying attention, you've undoubtedly seen the many attempts of Progressive power brokers to squelch opposing voices, from college campuses to the Entertainment Industry to the Web - all in the name of a more civil society – “civility” apparently meaning silent acquiescence to leftist ideals.If you don’t know what I’m talking about, you probably should stop reading this right now because Ringg Leeder will be lost on you. HUMOR.  NOT INSANITY                                                                                                                                     Please know that Ringg Leeder’s humor will never be vitriolic. There’s much too much bile in popular culture already.  Ringg Leeder’s comedy will be fearless but it will never sink into the vortex of venom we’re seeing so much of today.  Of course, we’ll lampoon the many bizarre stereotypes and causes promoted by liberals, but we’ll do so fully aware that resorting to mean-spirited invective is rarely funny.  Hmmm, what a concept.Let’s face it, the Left has bestowed upon us a delicious stew of absurdity, chock full of overripe ingredients just begging for caricature, like Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters, John Brennan, Al Sharpton, Rachel Maddow, Stephen Colbert, and a host of other self-important celebrities and corporate movers-and-shakers. No humorists in the history of the world have ever had so many easy pigeons to lampoon.  And yet these preposterous leftists have been curiously immune to satire.Hmm.  Perhaps conservatives in the Entertainment Industry (certainly, some do actually exist) must choose whether to express their true political views in their work or to have a career.  Sadly, only a very few seem to be fearless enough to attempt the former.So let me use the trite phraseology of the Left to describe Ringg Leeder’s unique place in the entertainment universe: Ringg Leeder will break down barriers, shatter stereotypes, be a pioneer, storm the bastions, be the change, be a trailblazer, be historic, and promote inclusion in a segregated workplace.(Yikes. Using those hackneyed phrases, even in fun, probably makes everyone want to take a shower. Please forgive us.  Had to be done.) Ringg Leeder will offer a platform for new Populist/Conservative humorists, performers, and writers to showcase their talent. Every marginalized group that has ever existed has needed a place where its art, music, and literature is nurtured, free from the repressive influence of a hostile establishment – and you can’t find anything more hostile to conservatives than contemporary Hollywood.   With your help, if Ringg Leeder is successful, it will have provided a fertile ground in which the seeds of creative conservatism are allowed to grow and flourish.   Why is that important?  Because when Big Media suppresses the dissemination of ideas it undermines democracy.  INDEPENDENT Ringg Leeder is not an advocate for any political party.  Of course, Ringg Leeder likes some politicians more than others, but Populist values are its only guiding principles, and humor and entertainment are its highest goals. (In case you haven’t surmised it by now, Ringg Leeder likes President Donald Trump a lot.  Unabashedly.)Maybe America wouldn’t be so divided if Big Media/Hollywood was more evenhanded.  Then maybe half the country wouldn’t feel they are being bullied by an out-of-touch monolithic industry that disdains them.  Ringg Leeder will never be a culture bully.  Bullying is mean.  And boring.Ringg Leeder will also satirize non-partisan topics such as fad dieting; binge TV watching; TV drug advertising; bumper sticker bravery; marijuana venality; Madison Avenue’s increasingly feminized imagery of men; hyperbolic “news”; class-action lawsuit mania; human-computer chip chimeras; NCAA greed; the over-medication of America; big-bank shenanigans; fabricated history in movies; reality-TV “investigative” shows; manscaping; the increasing loss of our personal privacy; tiny houses; anti-aging scams; driverless vehicles; new age hucksterism; excessive urban density to “save the environment”; affluenza; “toxic over-testing”; and anything else that deserves a comic roast .Ringg Leeder’s budget is tiny compared to an average network TV show, and that will be a challenge.  It’s dicey enough for Hollywood to find talented people, and they’re multi-billion-dollar corporations with unlimited resources.  But there’s an untapped reservoir of conservative talent that is just waiting for an opportunity, one that will never come if the status quo is not challenged.There are real gambles in this project.  Ringg Leeder’s actors might be risking their careers by espousing ideas that are loathed by the Entertainment Industry.   Production costs will be a challenge on Ringg Leeder’s shoestring budget - which may seem like a considerable sum to an average person- but is actually only a small fraction of the budget of a traditional TV show.  (A more detailed listing of production budget details are included at the end of this appeal). (If we are fortunate enough to exceed the amount of our request for funds, Ringg Leeder’s production values will improve accordingly and/or we’ll also add more shows. If Ringg Leeder does not reach its budgeted goal, the production will be scaled back and live actors may be replaced by animated figures.) Of course, it goes without saying that the Entertainment Industry spends seemingly limitless dollars to inflict their leftist view of reality on us.   THE BIG(GEST) PICTURETraditional Big Media doesn’t completely own the narrative anymore.  Hopefully, conservatives will soon no longer need Hollywood’s permission to create, to make art, drama, and comedy, and to get it out to people who appreciate it.  The Web rises - if we stand up and insist on it. Freedom of speech – democracy’s most fundamental value - still has a chance as long as the Web remains politically uncensored.  Sadly, even at this very moment, our right to disagree politically online is being challenged by self-serving internet plutocrats. Freedom of Speech includes the right to make people laugh – and think - especially those people who have been ignored for so long.Ringg Leeder is obviously microscopic in comparison to Hollywood’s leviathans.   But all new movements start small. Ringg Leeder is not a front for any partisan political advocacy group.  Ringg Leeder is independent.   Ringg Leeder’s autonomy is key to its ability to be fearless and not beholden to any special or corporate interest.In the final analysis, if Ringg Leeder is successful it will have helped foster a cultural terrain in which conservative talent can step in from the shadows and speak boldly from their hearts, with their own truths.Ringg Leeder’s producer, Ron LaMantia, like countless other Americans, has wearied of the constant leftist-centric political bashing across the entertainment landscape, and the absence of any countervailing entertainment content.  Ron has received a master’s degree from the University of Southern California Cinema/TV program.Please help Ringg Leeder take the first strides toward a more open-minded Entertainment Media.  It can’t be done without your support.And if you agree with the views expressed here, please be an ambassador for positive change and help spread the word about Ringg Leeder through social media and through any other appropriate manner.Many, many thanks.  BUDGETTalent (7 actors/actresses, 7 shows) $49,000Writers/Researcher (4) 32,000Director, Producer (2) 14,000Camera Crew (4) 40,000Sound Techs (2) 7000Additional crew, grip, floor manager, etc., 7000Post production, editing 7000Lighting, cameras, lighting, sound, grip rental 35,000Makeup, hair (3) 7000Wardrobe, costumes, etc.  7000Facilities & Prep 52,000Utilities – electricity, etc. 11,000Sets construction, supplies, tools, paint, rentals, carpenter, etc. 28,000A/V /editing/ misc. supplies 14,000Rights, clearances, music, stock footage, etc. 24,000Office rentals, supplies, etc. 3000Insurance, legal, accounting, payroll, etc. 17,000Internet services 31,000Misc., rehearsal prep, etc. 3000 Total: 388,000"

The reason that we are different from most college students is that we live in a small town and there is a lack of job offers close to home. In turn, we cannot make enough profit for gas money.

Democrats continuously conduct voter registration drives to sign up new voters and in the process educate young voters erroneously regarding the issues and Republican viewpoints.

I do not want an immigration program that seeks to reap every other country of their wealthy and to leave the poor citizens to fend for themselves.  Yes, our GDP might go up, but surely our foreign aid will also go up to help theses newly needy countries.  So, for all intents and purpose leave the wealthy in their own countries to help build their own economies.  Everyone wins.  I am asking for fifty thousand dollars to write my own comprehensive immigration plan that will work for everyone.  I have a vision problem, but my mind is still very much alert and with this money I will be able to hire one or two researchers and one or two writers, but my creative imagination will direct the flow of words to make everything happen.  If I am given the money, I will reach out to Representative Doris Matsui’s office for assistance in the technical assistance.  My overhaul will not only work on America’s Southern border, but will work in every major country in the World and my proposal will not seek out the wealthy but do more to educate and invigorate the poor.  We need to help build economies for the poor to live with and not just syphon off the wealthy leaving entire populations without a chance to survive.  We will build a fair and just immigration plan that will benefit everyone. Again, I need this money to hire my staff and bring my words to the general pubic.  I already have written fifteen novels, but none of them have been exposed to the world, but they all have good sentiment attached to their stories.  My name is Michael Lee Madsen Sr. I do not have any problem with sanctuaries and I do believe that Global Warming does exist.  Within two years of my plans, implementation half of the eleven million undocumented immigrants will be citizens of the United States of America, while the other half will gladly return to their home country. The Democrats have some grandiose ideas for America’s future without solutions, while I have many envisioned solutions prepared that would only take a concentrated look from those in power to see that we can make my solutions work. I possess a creative mind that I am willing to share with others, but I expect mutual compromise and yield the final project to make our world the nicest world we can have.  Our country has always been great, but now we must get it back to being nice.  A nice thought for our future, so that everyone can live a better Quality of Life.Immigration reform is not just a problem with America but a problem that the whole world must acknowledge to break the continued cycles of poverty; which keeps some nations from stagnation and without doing anything to raise their own people’s chances to succeed. Poor countries can never survive and generate hope if all we do is selectively transfer the wealthy from poor countries to rich.It is important that I receive the money to do my work, because other immigration plans that are less desirable are being prepared. My plan is fair and just and would benefit the whole world. This plan could be in congresses hands by early August 2019 as long as all the provisions I have asked for are met. My project is no good if another mean and uncaring Immigration Plan is adopted first.I want to give the politicians a good immigration plan to work with.#AFIREmlms"

For example: who’s who on the city council, and who holds the elected offices.  As a conservative individual, what I realized made me uncomfortable.  Even though council seats are nonpartisan, there is a very active democrat club here in Warren, and lots of our officials are active in it. I don’t have any real idea who isn’t a democrat and, therefore, who is representing me on the city council.  I realized that radical progressivism isn’t a “coastal” ideology.  It’s in my own backyard; it’s got zeal, community leaders, and organizers.Here I am - one of seven individuals running for two at-large seats on the Warren city council.  I need to reach 135,000 people before August 6th.  Ideally, long before that date, even, since elections here in Warren are won and lost with or without the votes of our absentee electorates. I need to act fast.  I need campaign materials, such as a robust web page with donation/payment options, flyers, business cards, door-hangers, yard signs, t-shirts, etcetera.  I don't have the benefit of name recognition here in Michigan's third largest city.  I am not a politician.  A great number of my opponents have been here for many years. I need your help.Please consider a donation today.  No amount is insignificant.  Whether you're a like-minded Warren resident, or just a like-minded patriot who understands the need for increased conservative representation across all levels of government, please help. Please share this link.Thank you for you contribution.GOD.  FAMILY.  COUNTRY.  May God bless America."

And no voice from the Democrats and the Republicans can save the spirits looking through the eyes of the families, ""It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. But there are some of you that believe not...Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it was given to him of my Father"" (John 6:63-65). It is the spirit that is looking through the eyes of man that should matter to everyone, should it?This government that sustains the spirits looking out of the eyes of the citizens and of the chosen offspring of the slaves in this land after 400 years have ended is, divided. Unrighteous Democrats and Republicans are among righteous Democrats and Republicans arguing and many think that it is over the resource, intellectual property, land, and other things, but if it is the words or the laws of man that govern people's spirits looking through their eyes, and the spirit that is looking through the eyes of man is the kingdom of God within man the two sides of the governments around the world are fighting over which side will rule over the spirit looking through the eyes of the citizens and since it is the kingdom of God not even the righteous can receive the kingdom that governs the ways of mankind unless I Christ give it to them. The left and the right ought to be doing the same righteous work for the citizens but the right cannot perform because the violence and the immorality that are on the earth as it was during the days of Noah and Lot is opposition. There are righteous Democrats and Republicans mingled in with the unrighteous Democrats and Republicans and this will end. It is causing arguments that leaves Republicans feeling unprofitable emotion in your spirits looking through your eyes. This weakens you as a spirit, and leave you feeling their foolish emotion of sin in your spirit looking through your eyes. They delight in feeling emotion of darkness of sin and death in their eyes so that they can imagine to express emotion out their bodies on others. Thus, righteous Democrats and Republicans working to sustain the lives of the families are getting worn out. All except for the POTUS. But, for how long?YOU PATRIOTS MUST GET THIS BEFORE THE POTUSThe Spirit of God is upon the POTUS hosting this voice. But with knowledge running to and fro with everyone thinking, that no man can know God since all that man ever said and done failed the spirits looking out the eyes of families how can mine elect one get the attention of the busiest man on earth to tell him that God has poured out a dream how the spirit of man works to end opposition? You patriots of all races must use the power of the air sharing My voice online with the POTUS to end the evilness against you and your loved ones. The time has come with publishing how the spirit of man works to judge evil spirits in the flesh. Years ago, God poured out a dream how the spirit of man looking out of the eyes of man works on the seed of David to be poured out on all flesh today to consummate evil spirits of the fallen angels looking out of eyes. What man can say that a man can declare that a man knows how the spirit of man looks and works while knowing that man has forgotten all about his spirit looking through his eyes at life around him?HOW THE MOST HIGH GOD IS WITH THE POTUSI am Christ a voice from heaven that is giving believers the dominion that the first man had on the earth. God has given the POTUS voice power to help save the nations. His service in societies means that his voice is anointed or approved to speak as God on earth against evil spirits in the flesh of man to clean the swamp. When the POTUS speaks his words rouse greater emotion that arrests the minds of others, causing the minds of others to obey the words in emotion. The opposition knows a secret. They know that man does not realize imagination is their power. God commanded Israel in Deuteronomy 29:19 to not bless themselves in imagination, and in Jeremiah 3:17 that Israel is not to walk after it. The evil spirits know that as long as you use imagination they can do violence to you for you do not have the seal of God from knowing your spirit. I Christ am a voice, I am legal in the flesh as your voice is. Repent, and I will give you power over serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy so that emotion cannot hurt you. THE POTUS MUST TAKE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVENThe POTUS has the authority of the first man to speak the words that arrest the minds of the opposition by their emotion. The POTUS is arresting minds and leaving the minds of rebels perishing by their own emotion insanity. God appointed POTUS to help bring down the strong, the mighty, and the terrible, but the POTUS is not there yet. As a king of the King that speaks how the spirit man works, and as one of the greatest man in charge in the last days the POTUS must take the kingdom. He is not far from it from working righteousness, but he must hear My voice in the seed of David. POTUS serves ideas that sustain societies, not for the money while ignoring what needs to be done in societies; he serves for the honey, to do what is right for citizens so that he can enjoy societies. God gave POTUS the power to get wealth and the power to enjoy it but the opposition is like it was during the days of Noah and Lot. It is too extreme to overlook.THE PATRIOTS MUST RALLY BEFORE THE POTUS ABOUT THIS INSIGHTI am the Lord of the spirit looking through your eyes! Many cannot accept the way I have appeared the second time, as I was born the first time: as a voice in the seed of David. I am watching to see who will be the arm of the Lord that lifts the hand of the Lord to build a house to properly host My voice how the spirit of man works. ""Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, this people say, the time is not come, the time that the Lord's house should be built. Then came the word of the Lord...saying, ""Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your... houses, and this house lie waste?"" Haggai 1:2-4. As your voice in the flesh shiver in the cold or is not comfortable in the heat so am I as a voice in the seed of David. As long as you believers do care about the house of the Lord for My voice you as voices cannot expect for your houses to stand for long, ""...Because mine house that is waste, and ye run every man to his own house"" (1:9).THE 400 YEARS ARE ENDED FOR THE OFFSPRING OF SLAVESMany cannot accept that I have returned as a voice in the poor of the offspring of slaves, but if they do not believe that I am he that teaches how to not walk after imagination as God commanded Israel they will die in their sin. The opposition and the apparitions of salvation are distracting you righteous Democrats and Republicans and you Jews that are and you Jews that are not to forget about the 400 years. Can you righteous speak and command the earth to stop shaking after earthquakes? The arrogance of man is extreme. The earth can shake all over at one time with small and great earthquakes for hours, days, weeks, months, even years if God did not command her not to do that. The arrogant cannot see that, but I am prophecy. WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THIS MANEvery man seeks after his own things, and not the things of Christ: which is and should be how the spirit of man works. If this man came in his own name like I did not come when I was born a voice in the flesh you leaders would accept him. But as it was when I was born a voice in the flesh: common people hear him gladly about their spirits and imagination. The rich and famous, the immoral and the wicked are in too deep building their life in imagination to easily repent. But you, O patriots, give mine interest on the pounds that you have serving ideas to make a living help meeting the needs of the families so that I can set up the kingdom of God and of heaven in people's spirits and establish a model government in this land after 400 years to gather the new spirits for reparation and preparation to return to your own land. Who else is declaring this?I am a great voice from heaven in the seed of David to see to it that the house of the Lord is built before prophecy is fulfilled, ""For thus saith the Lord of hosts; yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land: and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts"" (Haggai 2: 6-9). Prepare yourselves. Do not expect for I Christ speaking from heaven to not be heard as a voice on the earth now that the seed of David among you is declaring that I am a voice in him about how to not walk after imaginationTHE PENT-UP WRATH OF GOD IS UPON ALL THE NATIONSHear My voice! How can any man argue with the voice that saves him as a spirit looking through his eyes? What manner of spirit is he? There are evil spirits looking out of eyes behind the scene that approves the products and services that sustain the families. They give people their reasons for wanting to wake up in the mornings to pursue this life yet none can help or save the spirits looking out the eyes of families. They add harmful things to products and services that harm families, and for that, ""I will shake the heavens and the earth, and I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen, and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. In that day will I take thee, O...my servant...and make thee a signet: for I have chosen thee..."" (2:21-23). It will be done to be built mine house. Let all with ears to hear bring gifts to I the King of the Jews as a great voice in the seed of David like the wise men brought gifts when I was born a voice in the seed of David as the King of the Jews.I am watching to see who honors My voice in the flesh, as they honor the voices of others in the flesh.
