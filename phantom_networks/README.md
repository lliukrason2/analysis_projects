# Project Summary
This project was inspired by this article about phantom networks within the mental health care industry: https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/17/ghost-networks-psychiatrists-hinder-patient-care/

Driving questions included:
* Is there a way to size up or estimate a phantom network within an insurance company? 

# Project Contents
This project includes:
* a script that pulls from NPI's API for psychiatrist names
* a scraper of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology's database of active and licensed psychiatrists
* a script that cleans a sample 500 page PDF from Blue Cross Blue Shield of in network psychiatrists

# Future Work
Future work with this project could include:
* cleaning of psychiatrist names repositories
* cross referencing actively licensed psychiatrists with "in-network psychiatrists"
* generalizing the cleaning script for other BCBS samples
